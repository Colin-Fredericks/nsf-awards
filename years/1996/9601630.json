 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding  is  requested  to  purchase a gas  chromatograph-isotope  ratio  mass spectrometer (GC-CIRMS). This instrument permits  the  measurement  of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope  ratios  of  a  wide variety of organic molecules, essentially all of those which  can  be  resolved by gas chromatography or which can be converted  to  a suitable volatile derivative. Also, funds are requested for  an  off-line,  automated high-performance  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC) system for isolation of specific compounds for subsequent,  off-line,  IRMS.  This approach is needed for  certain  compounds  which  are  too involatile or lack sufficient heat stability  for  GC;  it also can be more convenient for compounds, such as  amino  acids,  which require extensive derivatization for GC.  Together,  these  instruments would constitute a facility that could measure  the  C  and  N  isotopic  composition of  virtually  any  organic  substance.  Specifically, the HPLC and GC-IRMS would be  used  to  measure  the stable isotope composition of amino acids and  fatty  acids  in  the course of studies of the growth rate  and  trophic  dynamics  of  marine mammals. The stable isotope  composition  of  specific  organic compounds, such as amino acids,  carbohydrates,  hydrocarbons, and lipids, from marine and lake sediments would be  used  in  investigations of the sources and diagenetic alteration  of these substances, assisting studies of environmental change at  high  northern latitudes. Also, the instruments would be used  in  tracer  investigations  of the metabolism  of  large  mammals  by  measuring  changes  over  time  in the  isotopic  composition  of  metabolites such as volatile fatty acids. Finally, the  GC-C-IRMS  would  be  used  to distinguish naturally-occurring  hydrocarbons  from petroleum-derived contaminants.",
