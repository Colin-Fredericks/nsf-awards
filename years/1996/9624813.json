 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, aims to explore  and characterize the formation, properties and applications of  organically modified sol-gels.  The unique properties of these  hybrid inorganic-organic materials remain to be exploited fully.   The mechanism by which solutes become entrapped in these  materials and the control of this process will be studied.   Cyclic voltammetry (CV) with ultramicroelectrodes will be used to  follow local physical and chemical changes that occur during  hydrolysis and condensation of alkoxysilanes on the surfaces of  these materials.  CV and electrogenerated chemiluminescence will  be used to characterize the mobility and accessibility of small  charged redox probes entrapped in the sol-gel matrix under  processing conditions.  Practical results from this CAREER  research project will focus on the development of permselective  coatings for electroanalytical investigations and the fabrication  of electrochemiluminscent sensors.  Professor Collinson will  combine these research thrusts with an educational plan that  includes the development of a course in scientific ethics for  both undergraduate and graduate students.  A major revision of  the laboratory component of an undergraduate course in chemical  analysis is also planned.  Student interest is to be cultivated  by also employing more creative and realistic samples for  analysis in this course with particular attention to forensic and  environmental applications.    The development of a fundamental understanding of the  characteristics of the sol-gel matrix as an environment in which  to do chemistry is an important objective of this CAREER research  proposal.  In the long term being able to tailor these matrices  to a particular application using organically modified silicates  will have strategic impact.  The xerogels that are produced upon  drying of sol-gels have interesting properties in their own right  which could lead to useful applications in electronic, magnetic,  optical materials and derived products.  Professor Collinson's  aim to introduce formally contemporary issues in scientific  ethics and scientific conduct is timely, and this course will  enable the students at Kansas State University to more clearly  understand this topic.",
