 "awd_abstract_narration": "The St. Croix Watershed Research Station (SCWRS) is the  biological field station of  the Science Museum of Minnesota  (SMM).  The lands and facilities of the SCWRS are located  within St. Croix National Scenic Riverway at the boundary  between Minnesota and Wisconsin. The SCWRS provides  opportunities to conduct research on a large midcontinental  river system and associated habitats.    The SCWRS was established in 1989 and has greatly expanded  its physical facilities, staffing, and research activity in  the intervening six years.  Following a strategic planning  effort, a modern 6200 ft2 Research Center and year-round  housing facility for visiting scientists were completed in  1995. In 1995-96 the SCWRS expanded its permanent research  staff to create a core research program focusing on  landscape-level problems in land-water interaction. A total  of 35 separate visiting research programs have been  supported at the SCWRS over the past six field seasons,  including several major projects dealing ecological problems  of national and global significance.    This project is a direct outgrowth of the recent expansion  of SCWRS physical facilities and the immediate need to  acquire key pieces of analytical equipment to support  current and pending research initiatives. Support is  requested for three major acquisitions: (1) an automated ion  analyzer for measuring phosphorus, nitrogen, and silica in  water, and solids; and (3) research-grade stereo-and  compound microscopes.  These instruments will greatly  improve SCWRS's analytical capabilities for measurement  of biological and biogeochemical components of aquatic  systems.",
