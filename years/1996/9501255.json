Lin proposes to extend his earlier work on the construction of  asymptotic expansions for composite wave-front solutions of  reaction-diffusion equations, and on a shadowing lemma approach  to  proving that there is a true solution near such an expansion, to  more  general singularly perturbed partial differential equations and  to  partially singularly perturbed systems.  He also proposes to  extend to  higher dimensional systems the SLEP method for studying the  stability  of such solutions in a special case.  Schecter proposes to build  on  earlier work that characterized structurally stable strictly  hyperbolic  Riemann solutions for systems of two conservation laws in one  space  dimension.  He proposes in particular to extend this work to the  non-strictly-hyperbolic case, to find all codimension one Riemann  solutions by examining the violation of each of the conditions  for  structural stability, and to study each codimension one  bifurcation in  detail.  Schecter and Lin together propose to look at whether  Lin's  approach to singular perturbation problems will enable one to  regard a  Riemann problem solution as the start of an asymptotic expansion  of a  solution to an associated parabolic problem.  %%%  Sharp wave fronts occur in many areas of science.  From the  mathematical viewpoint, they arise as solutions of partial  differential  equations that model various physical situations.  The  investigators  propose to continue their research on wave fronts.  For one type  of  partial differential equation, reaction-diffusion equations, Lin  has  developed a method of calculating formal solutions in which  several  sharp fronts separate more slowly changing portions of the  solution.  He has also developed a rigorous method, modeled on the  \"shadowing  lemma \" of dynamical systems theory, of showing that there is a  true  solution near the calculated formal solution.  He proposes to  extend  this work to more general partial differential equations.  He  also  proposes to use his approach to extend a technique that has been  used  in a special case to study the stability of such solutions.  For  another type of partial differential equation, systems of two  conservation laws in one space dimension, Schecter has studied  solutions in which jump discontinuities separate slowly changing  portions.  These arise as solutions of Riemann problems, in which  the  initial state of the system consists of two constant values  separated  by a single jump.  Schecter has characterized the Riemann  solutions  that are structurally stable, in the sense that the basic  character of  the solution does not change when the initial states are varied  slightly.  He proposes to extend this work in a number of  directions,  for example, by identifying the simplest ways in which structural  stability can break down.  Schecter and Lin together propose to  look at  whether Lin's approach to calculating formal solutions with sharp  wave  fronts will enable one to a regard a Riemann solution as the  start of  such a formal solution to a more realistic partial differential  equation.  ***",
