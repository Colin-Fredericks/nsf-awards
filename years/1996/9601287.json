For example, edges that are slightly oblique are  perceived as aberrations of perfectly horizontal or vertical  edges, as when we attempt to straighten a painting that appears  to be hanging askew.  Against a background of oblique lines of  the same orientation, however, a horizontal or vertical line is  perceived as unstable.  Perceptual stability and instability are  thus context dependent.  Stable elements serve as cognitive  reference points, and unstable elements are perceived in relation  to (are perceptually anchored to) their closest stable elements.   This research will explore mechanisms underlying the perceptual  anchoring of auditory events in familiar auditory contexts.  In  music that utilizes culturally familiar patterns, for example,  some tones are heard as more unstable, unfamiliar or dissonant  than others.  Unstable tones seem to demand resolution to (are  anchored by) stable tones that are pitch neighbors.  This  research will develop neural net models to account for how  learned auditory patterns are heard in terms of stable and  unstable elements, and how unstable elements are anchored by  stable neighbors.  When a tone is heard, a mechanism called  auditory selective attention focuses processing in a narrow band  of frequency-tuned neural units around the frequency of the tone.  The neural units that are most active within that band then  capture auditory selective attention.  Thus when an unstable tone  is heard, the stable tones that are closest in frequency capture   auditory selective attention, resulting in the anchoring of the  unstable tone.  This research will include the detailed  development and computer simulation of the neural modeling  outlined here.  It will also include a set of perceptual   experiments that test the model that will vary the frequency  distance of unstable tones to their stable neighbors.  The work  should lead to a better understanding of the perce ption of  unfamiliar events in familiar perceptual environments, with  implications for the design of artificial perceptual recognition  systems.    ***",
