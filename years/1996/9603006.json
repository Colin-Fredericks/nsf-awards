 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nuclear theory program in the Department of Physics and  Astronomy at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge is focused  on the properties of atomic nuclei under extreme conditions:  high spin, large deformation, stretched isospin, etc.  Of special  interest is the structure of strongly deformed nuclei of the rare  earth and actinide regions.  The collective modes of these nuclei  involve a large fraction of the total number of constituent  nucleons and therefore a special shell-model theory --- one that  is not bound by the usual constraints of an independent particle  picture --- is required to understand these collective features.  The proposed research will focus on several matters:  potential  energy surfaces and excitation energies; electromagnetic moments  and transition strengths; giant resonances; nuclear currents;  double beta decay strengths; and superdeformation.  However, a  deeper and more challenging objective of the proposed research is  to probe those special features of the nucleon-nucleon  interaction that give rise to mean fields and observed collective  phenomena.  In particular, the proposed program will continue to  focus on the origin of pseudo-spin symmetry and the complementary  of proton and neutron dynamics.  The training of graduate  students (currently five) and the building of international  collaborations (from former Soviet Union countries and Mexico, in  particular) are an integral part of the research  effort.",
