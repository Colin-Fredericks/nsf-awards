 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9527453  Newman    The fields of developmental and evolutionary biology are both undergoing ferment. The vast progress in the last few years in characterizing the genetic mechanisms involved in embryonic development has demonstrated unexpected degrees of functional redundancy and overdetermination in these processes. In addition, evolutionary studies have revealed surprising extents of homoplasy and other forms of parallel morphological evolution in disparate lineages, as well as evidence that extensive morphological diversity appeared much earlier in the history of multicellular life than previously thought. These phenomena have raised new questions concerning the relationship between gene activity and the generation of biological form, and have suggested to some that the solution to these puzzles will emerge with the development of a new parardigm for understanding the evolution of developmental systems. It is the purpose of this symposium on \"Determinants of Morphological Evolution\" to bring together investigators in the areas of developmental and evolutionary biology whose work evidences an appreciation of the connection between these disciplines, and physical scientists working in the areas of morphogenesis of condensed materials, to discuss questions of the genetic, epigenetic, physical and life history determinants of the evolution of biological form. The invitation by the organizers of the Fifth International Congress of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology to present a symposium on these subjects represents an encouragement to such interdisciplinary activity, and the site of this meeting, in Hungary, will help foster communication among groups of scientists with traditionally different approaches to the study of biological form.  ***",
