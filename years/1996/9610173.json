Kieber  OPP 9527255 & OPP 9610173    PHOTOCHEMICAL AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF ANTARCTIC WATERS IN  RESPONSE TO CHANGING UV-B FLUXES    The decrease in stratospheric ozone over the Antarctic  results in an increase in the UV-B flux in the euphotic  zone. The increase leads to cellular damage to aquatic  organisms, as documented by photo-inhibition and decreased  productivity. Cellular damage can occur either  intracellularly, or externally at the cell surface from  biomolecular reactions with externally-generated reactive  transients. The extent of this extracellular damage will  depend on the photochemistry of the seawater surrounding the  cell. Until recently, nothing was known about the type of  photochemical processes, rates, and steady state  concentrations of transients in Antarctic waters. It is  proposed that field experiments be performed which will  allow the construction of predictive models of photochemical  production rates in surface waters and with depth. These  studies will involve further quantum yield measurementts,  development of a sensitive underwater actinometer system,  and use of a new underwater multichannel photometer. The  model will allow the prediction of the impact of varying  levels of UV-B on the photoproduction and steady state  concentration of several key reactive transient species in  the upper water column. In addition to this effort,  experiments will also be performed to study the  photodegradation of dissolved organic matter and to  determine whether biologically utilizable substrates that  are formed photochemically can enhance secondary  productivity in Antarctic waters.",
