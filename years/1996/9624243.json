 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Faculty Early Career Development Program award funded by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Bowers   will study nanostructured III-V semiconductor systems using enhanced   sensitivity nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).  Ultrahigh   sensitivity NMR techniques will be developed, including solid-state   optical pumping, spin inject dynamic nuclear polarization, and   magnetoresistance detection.  Some of the examples that will be examined   include structural studies of dopant complex bonding geometries, the   detection of skyrmions in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), and   the determination of quasi-Landau level structure and magnetic moments of   composite Fermions in the characterization of ordering and phase domains   in semiconductor alloys including the III-V nitrides.  Some of these   experiments will be conducted at the National High Magnetic Field   Laboratory (NHMFL).  The education plan will include sponsorship of   undergraduate research at NHMFL, the development of computer-assisted   chemical education and the virtual classroom, and expansion of a highly   successful NMR seminar series.  One goal of this project is to demonstrate the potential of NMR to   provide new information about nanostructured electronic materials which   may not be available by any other analytical measurement.  All of the   systems of interest have novel device applications, such as in various   types of field effect transistors and in blue- or ultraviolet-light diode   lasers.  The educational part of this CAREER grant will promote an   understanding of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for both   undergraduate and graduate students through classroom work, seminars, and   hands-on research in one of the world's best a settings for research with   high magnetic fields.",
