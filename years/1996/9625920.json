However, these techniques are limited by the fact that, in their  context, performance must be measured in the same norm used to  assess stability.  Clearly, a single norm is usually not enough  to capture different, and often conflicting, design  specifications.  Therefore, designers are forced to use weighing  functions and similarity scaling, coupled with extensive trial  and error, in an attempt to translate realistic specifications  into a form amenable to the theoretical framework.       In this research we propose to develop a synthesis framework  that explicitly takes into account multiple performance  specifications and uncertainty.  The proposed research will  combine elements from functional analysis, linear systems theory  and viability theory. In the case of linear controllers,  multiobjective problems can be recast into a convex optimization   form that can be exactly and efficiently solved.  In the case of  nonlinear feedback, preliminary results using viability theory  show that any performance level obtained with a linear dynamic  state-feedback controller can also be achieved using nonlinear  static controllers.  Thus, there exists a potential tradeoff  between linear dynamics and static nonlinearities.  This research  effort will result in an expanded robust control framework,  capable of addressing realistic problems without necessitating  neither potentially conservative approximations for multiple  trial and error type iterations, leading to improved and less  costly designs.    The portion of the research related to synthesizing multiobjective  controllers under hard control constraints and their experimental  validation in an anaerobic digester will be carried out in  cooperation with an interdisciplinary control group located at the  Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana, Mexico, headed by Dr. Rodolfo  Suarez Cortez (Mathemat ics).  This research is supported under NSF-  CONTACYT Collaborative Research Opportunity.  ***",
