 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634859   Webster   Acoustic emission (AE) is an in-process sensing technique that offers promise in detecting grinding damage like burning, residual stress or cracking.  While filtered root-mean-square AE signals have been used in a number of grinding applications, using the unfiltered signal with advanced signal processing methods has the potential to provide better signatures for identifying and classifying grinding damage.  This project will design signal processing methods to handle AE signals in the 0.015 - 1.2 MHz range, and determine the detection and classification methods to monitor different types of grinding damage.  Using the facilities of the Center for Grinding Research and Development at the University of Connecticut, the experimental program will consider workpiece burn detection in creep-feed and shallow-cut grinding, and surface and subsurface damage in ceramic grinding.  This project has a balance between theory and experiment. Of particular significance for a university lab, is the capability to gather experimental data on creep feed grinding.         The use of AE sensor technology and signal processing has the potential for improving the material removal rates and productivity in grinding by preventing grinding burn.  This will allow the material removal rates to be increased without a penalty in productivity,  quality or component performance.",
