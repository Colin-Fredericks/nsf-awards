 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528089  Bosch  Recently documented global decreases in stratospheric ozone have  brought attention to the potential ecological consequences of  increased ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in marine communities.  Even without ozone depletion, UVB radiation penetrating into  surface waters of the ocean represents a biological hazard to  many marine organisms. The most extensive destruction of ozone  has been occurring over the Antarctic continent and Southern  Ocean, where over 50% depletion is recorded each spring.  A major  obstacle in assessing UV effects is that very little is known  about the UV photobiology of individual species.  In the  Antarctic, some of the more ecologically dominant benthic  invertebrate species occupy intertidal and shallow subtidal  depths where biological effects of UVB have already been  documented. Many of these species have planktonic development and  their spawning season coincides with the period when ozone  depletion is occurring; thus their microscopic embryos and  larvae are exposed to increasingly higher levels of UVB.  At  present there is no information on the potential short- or long-  term effects of increased UVB levels on populations of Antarctic  benthic invertebrates.    The research proposed here will focus on the UV photobiology of  three important Antarctic invertebrate species that inhabit  intertidal and subtidal areas in the region of Palmer Station,  Anvers Island, Antarctic Peninsula.  These species are the limpet  Nacella concinna, the sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri and the  sea star Odontaster validus. The adults of these species are  dominant members of Antarctic intertidal and shallow subtidal  benthic communities, and their embryos and larvae develop for  months in surface waters from late austral winter through summer.  This study will evaluate the impact of ambient UVB on early  stages (gametes, embryos and larvae) of the life histories of  these species by 1) examining potential UV exposure levels, 2)  assessing differential sensitivit ies, 3) identifying molecular,  chromosomal and morphological UVBinduced damage, and 4)  evaluating potential protection and recovery from UVB exposure.  Since these species have taxonomic equivalents at both temperate  and tropical latitudes, this work will provide important  biological parameters for increasing our knowledge about UV  effects on both local and global scales.",
