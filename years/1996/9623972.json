Novel experimental,  numerical,  and theoretical methods are being  developed  to  investigate the structure and dynamics of complex fluids and  macromolecular   assemblies   These   experimental   methods  involve  the  measurement of the structural and  rheological  properties  of  either  individual aggregates  or  molecules  (microscopy)  or  of  an ensemble of colloids/macromolecules  (scattering  and  rheology).   These  experimental   methods  include (i) magnetic tweezers to micro-manipulate individual  biological  macromolecules such as DNA and proteins  in  the  bulk  and near interfaces, (ii) high-resolution fluorescence  microcopy   to  image  the  Brownian  motion  of  individual  biological    macromolecules,   vesicles,   and    colloidal  aggregates  (iii) diffusive wave spectroscopy to  probe  the  collective  dynamics  and  the quiescent  micro-rheology  of  concentrated  colloidal  suspensions,  microemulsions,   and  polymer   solutions.   To  analyze  these   scattering   and  microscopy  experiments, Monte Carlo and molecular  dynamics  simulations, as well as stochastic equations of  motion  are  being developed to describe the non-equilibrium dynamics  of  complex fluids and macromolecules in external force fields.  %%%  This research will provide a direct test of theories of  gel  electrophoresis  and will help improve current  theories  of  gene therapy and polymer-based drug-delivery systems.  These  new   tools   will  also  offer  a  direct  way   to   probe  conformational and transport-properties changes  induced  by  DNA-DNA,   protein-DNA,  and  protein-protein  interactions,  which  have  implications  on the design,  development,  and  testing of new drugs.  ***",
