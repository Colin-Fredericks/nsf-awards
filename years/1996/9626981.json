 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Virginia W. Cornish has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Cornish received the doctoral degree from   the University of California at Berkeley under the supervision of   Professor Peter G. Schultz.  Dr. Cornish will continue research at the   Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of Professor   Robert T. Sauer.  The postdoctoral research examines the importance of N-   and C-cap residues in stabilizing alpha-helices.  The work uses genetic   selections to isolate proteins with particular residues in the N- and   C-cap positions, as well as x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic   resonance spectroscopy to characterize the three-dimensional structure of   the proteins.  Understanding is gained into how to design genetic   selections so that in addition to engineering proteins with novel   catalytic properties, one my use the selections to learn about the   requirement for successful catalysis.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
