 "awd_abstract_narration": "A flow analysis is an automatic tool that collects information  about programs. Flow information is crucial, for without it the  correctness of sophisticated program transformations cannot be  verified. Such transformations are important, because they can  transform a program written to solve a problem cleanly into a new  program that, for example, is more efficient and fault tolerant.  Ultimately, flow analysis-justified transformations can boost  software reliability and programmer productivity. Despite their  utility, however, existing flow analyses for mostly-functional  languages are impractical for use in production-quality  environments. They have high algorithmic complexity, they can  only process language subsets, and they are accurate only when  programs are written in a certain style.    This CAREER project has three goals to address these problems and  incorporate advanced analysis techniques into the undergraduate  curriculum. The first goal is to use a practical flow analysis in  a production Scheme compiler to justify optimizations. The second  goal is to use the flow analysis and the experience gained from  its application to develop a program transformation toolkit for  building automatic, flow analysis-based program transformers. The  third goal is to incorporate the results into the undergraduate  curriculum so that students understand what a flow analysis is,  how it works, and how it can be profitably applied.    Achieving these goals advances both research and education.  Besides solving the above problems, the research aspect of this  project pursues contributions in the areas of language  implementation and semantics-based program manipulation.  In particular, optimizations are being implemented that can  improve the performance of dynamic languages, program  transformation techniques are being developed that allow more  realistic programs to be manipulated. The transformation toolkit  developed is expected to provide the research community with  needed infrastructure for  experimenting with transformations.    The educational aspect of this CAREER investigation seeks to  improve the undergraduate programming languages curriculum by  addressing the distinction between static and dynamic properties  of programs and how static information can be used to optimize  programs. Such an understanding is essential to undergraduate  education as programming languages are playing an increasingly  prominent role in customizable software.  ***",
