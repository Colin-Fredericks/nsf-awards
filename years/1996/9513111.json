 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513133  Grossman    This award supports a three year cooperative research  project between Dr. Arthur Grossman of the Carnegie  Institution of Washington at Palo Alto and a group led by  Dr. Hideaki Usuda at Teikyo University in Tokyo. This  project brings together two groups with very different  disciplines.  Usuda and his group are using physiological  tools to examine changes in metabolic processes during the  acclimation of a unicellular green algae to phosphorus  limitation.  Grossman's group is more focused on molecular  technology and how that technology can be used to define the  molecular details of acclimation to nutrient limitation.  Grossman and two graduate students will visit japan to help  initiate molecular work at Teikyo University and acquire the  skills for quantifying physiological processes. The project  brings together workers with complementary skills.  There  will be a valuable exchange of both technical and conceptual  information that will be important for both short and long  term interactions. Therefore, this collaboration fulfills  the objectives of the Program by promoting the exchange of  scientific knowledge and promising to result in a long term  productive interaction with the Japanese scientific  community.  ***",
