These  structures, which will have one or more dimensions in the 100 - 300  ,  will  be  used  to  study  fundamental problems  in  condensed  matter  physics.  Issues  which  will be addressed  include  the  behavior  of  magnetic  impurities near surfaces and in the presence of a disordered  environment, quantum mechanical behavior off magnetic domain walls  in  ferromagnets,  and  fluctuations near critical points  in  ultra-small  systems.  In addition to providing new insights into these fundamental  problems,  this  work  should also be relevant  to  the  technological  problems associated with advanced micro-fabrication processes, and  to  high density information storage in magnetic media.  %%%  This continuing improvements in micro-fabrication techniques, such  as  those  used  to make hgth density integrated circuits, provide  unique  opportunities  for basic physics research. Many interesting  phenomena  occur  only  in extremely small structures. This work will  use  small  structures  as  tools  to  address several  fundamental  questions  in  condensed  matter physics. These questions include  the   behavior  of  magnetic impurities in metals, and the quantum mechanical behavior  of  domain   walls  in  magnets.  This  fundamental  work  is   also   for  technological interest, since the physics that will be elucidated will  be  relevant  to future generations electronic devices. In particular,  the  work on domain walls will be of direct relevance to high  density  magnetic storage devices. Moreover, the lithographic methods that will  be used are prototypes of the methods that will be required to produce  future  generations  of  electronic  devices.  Progress  made  now  in  developing  and refining new laboratory scale lithographic  techniques  may prove useful in the fabrication of the next generation of devices.  ***",
