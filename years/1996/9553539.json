The program is interdisciplinary, integrating computer science, physics and mathematics. the students are introduced to basic computer architecture, after which they assemble IBM-compatible microcomputers that are given to them to keep at the completion of the program. Other activities involve students performing labs in digital electronics, engineering and computer architecture, under the direction of a research physicist. The students also perform experiments on mathematical objects using computer programs they write in Pascal. Field trips are an integral part of the project. Career-oriented field trips will be made to R&D and production facilities such as AT&T Bell laboratories, Motorola, Rockwell International, and General Motors.  ***",
