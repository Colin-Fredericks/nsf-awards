 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9623008  PI:  Albert Sheu  University of Kansas    The proposer will continue his research on the interaction between   C*-algebras and geometry, with emphasis on the groupoid C*-algebra   approach to quantum groups and deformation quantization. Topics to   be studied include the realization of quantum groups as groupoid   C*-algebras, leaf-preserving and group-preserving deformation   quantizations of concrete Poisson Lie groups, holomorphic foliation   and deformation quantization, and the cancellation problem for    group C*-algebras. The main tools to be used in this research will   be from various mathematical branches like C*-algebras, Lie   groups, differential geometry, and pseudodifferential operators.     This research is motivated by the recent worldwide interest in   the noncommutative aspect of geometry originated from the concept   of quantization which links together several branches of mathematics   and quantum physics. In the physical sciences, it is important to study   the invariance of quantities under various symmetry group actions. The   theory of quantum groups generalizes the classical theory of symmetry   groups and provides new and promising directions in the study of   quantum physics. By studying the structure of quantum groups in a   new way and by exploring related questions, the proposer hopes to   contribute to the understanding of this relatively new and exciting   area of mathematics.",
