 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gravitational waves are a potential new window to view the  universe.  The Michigan group will join the LIGO (Laser  Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) team  designing, constructing, and using the LIGO facility.  Their  initial effort would be to assist in the 40 Meter  Interferometer (the LIGO prototype-test bench) Research and  Development Program.  Gustafson would be substantially  resident at the 40 Meter, and become competent to run the  interferometer.  The goal would be to support the R/D  program, using the 40 Meter as an operational device,  working within the framework of the current R/D test,  addition, or upgrade program.  They would keep the  interferometer active, dealing with the residual problems  and exploring operational realities.  Data collection, would  become a norm, and analysis attempted at the 10**-19 level  in sensitivity, with the spurious noise sources understood  and eliminated.  This activity would contribute to the LIGO Detector and  Facility effort, and to the `Advanced LIGO` concept.  All  actions would be deferential to the R/D program, mostly in  the mode of `diagnose, discuss, fix as agreed`.  This  program is an example of an operational working relationship  between LIGO and the University user community.",
