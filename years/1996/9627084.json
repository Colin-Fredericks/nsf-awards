 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627084  Weiss    The New York Hall of Science will develop an interactive exhibit  for the general public \"The Chemistry of Life\".  There will be two  editions of the exhibit: one 2,500 sq. ft. version will be  installed permanently in the New York Hall of Science and another  1500 sq. ft. version will travel nationally.  Focusing on the  common chemical processes behind all life on earth, the exhibit  will help visitors learn four basic chemistry concepts: 1) a shared  chemistry underlies all forms of life, 2) the chemistry of energy  transformation takes place in all living things, 3) chemical energy  is converted to mechanical energy to animate life, and 4) the  chemistry of reproduction provides for the continuity of life.  The  chemistry of the human body will be used whenever possible as an  entry point to the concepts.  Exhibits will include a hands-on  staffed visitor chemistry lab, interactive activities,  stimulations, models, demonstrations, and video clips.   Complementary materials and workshops will be developed for  families, school groups, and teachers.  These materials are being  developed with the curricular needs of the New York State Systemic  Initiative and New York City Urban Systemic Initiative in mind.   Teacher and student materials will be keyed to the curriculum  guidelines.  The long-term exhibit is scheduled to open late in  1998 and the traveling version will be available in spring 1999.",
