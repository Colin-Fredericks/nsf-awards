 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630440  Ryan      The field of endocrinology is a rapidly advancing area of biology.   A number of highly significant advances in biology have been  derived from investigations into the action of hormones on cellular  and organismal function, and the mechanisms used for cellular  communication.  This discipline now spans the great diversity of  research interests from investigations into the molecular events in  cell nuclei caused by steroid hormone interactions with  intracellular receptors to understanding hormonal regulation of  behavior.  The International Congress of Endocrinology to be held  in San Francisco, CA in June, 1996 represents a mechanism for  investigators, young and old, to come together to learn about the  latest advances in this rapidly evolving field.  With this award,  the Women in Endocrinology will support the travel of 10 young  female investigators to attend the International Congress.   Attendance at this Congress will be a mechanism for new  investieators to present their data to their peers and to discuss  the recent advances in this field.  In addition, it will provide  young female investigators with a mechanism to develop  relationships with more senior female investigators in  endocrinology, who can help them in the future successfully  navigate a career path.  Attendance at this meeting will positively  impact the young investigator, as well as the other investigators  in attendance.",
