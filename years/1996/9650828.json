 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is the enhancement of the laboratory experience in introductory, organic, and analytical chemistry through the acquisition of an FTIR spectrophotometer. This instrument allows rapid acquisition of spectra and helps students relate practical experiences to theory. The project provides students with FTIR instrumentation which allows them to assimilate theory and concepts, resulting in improved learning; provides students with experience in applying qualitative methods to the analysis of data, resulting in increased critical thinking and problem solving skills; better prepares students for transfer into 4-year science and engineering curricula or for entry into technical careers by providing a practical laboratory experience using spectroscopy; and provides underprepared students exposure to advanced analytical tools and an appreciation for \"real world\" chemistry by developing laboratory exercises that incorporate FTIR applications. The addition of FTIR to the laboratory, integrated with assignments in the classroom, reinforces concepts and provide students a more comprehensive understanding of entry-level and college-transfer chemistry. The approach in integrating theory and application encourages further exploration and practice on the part of the students.",
