 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project seeks to demonstrate that fundamental  operating system services and resources can and should be  represented directly in the natural linguistic structures of  advanced programming languages. A component of this effort is to  develop aggressive optimisation strategies making this modelling  practical and efficient.    The central question underlying the research is: how can the  benefits of advanced programming languages be brought to bear  upon current systems-programming practice?  Modern computer  applications are most commonly written in C, a language well-  known for its lack of support for writing modular, robust  programs.  C has no module system, allows dangerous \"casting\" of  data types, violates abstraction barriers, provides no garbage-  collection support for automatic storage management, has no  concurrency operators, and generally exposes the details of the  underlying machine to the programmer. It is not defined in terms  of a mathematically sound underlying semantics. As a result,  modern software is fragile, error-prone, and difficult to build,  maintain or reuse.    Modern programming languages, such as the ML family of languages,  provide much more support to the programmer for writing large,  robust programs. Unfortunately, these languages are not yet  practical tools for implementing real-world systems software.  In  practice, programs written in these languages are slow, use large  amounts of memory, and have awkward interfaces to OS services.  Providing access from programs written in these languages to the  machine resources, in ways that are natural to the language,  should help to address these shortcomings.  This research enables  new optimisations and makes available new models to the  programmer, allowing systems programs to be written that exploit  the expressive power of advanced programming languages. A service  kernel provides access to the underlying machine resources in a  way that is tightly integrated, both in architecture and in  implem entation, with advanced languages. The research issue is to  investigate the architecture of an operating system that is  symbiotic, not with C,  but with a modern programming language,  and to develop technologies for exploiting the tight integration  of the OS and the compiler to provide efficient, high-level  services. The kernel is being developed in ML, on two hardware  platforms: a bare Intel PC system, and a wireless, mobile  \"personal digital assistant\" with limited on-board resources.  ***",
