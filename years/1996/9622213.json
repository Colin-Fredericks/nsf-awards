 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622213  German    This award supports the acquisition of two instruments which  analyze oxygen/nitrogen and carbon/sulfur content in  engineering materials.  The presence of these four elements  can have far-reaching effects on the microstructure,  mechanical properties, thermal properties, and electronic  behavior of engineering materials, especially when they are  used as powders.  When dealing with powdered metals and  ceramics, the processing, sintering, and post-sintering  properties are often controlled by the surface chemistry of  the starting material.  Elements such as carbon, nitrogen,  sulfur, and oxygen are known to concentrate on particle  surfaces.  Thus, the ability to detect their presence and  quantify the amount of each that is present is crucial to  understanding the final properties of the material.  This  equipment will provide envaluable information on many areas  of powder processing including:  (1) The effect of sintering  atmosphere on the mechanical properties of high performance  alloys; (2) Binder selection for the processing of  particulate materials; (3) The effect of powder chemistry on  the thermal behavior of materials; (4) Oxide growth; and (5)  Fundamental microstructural studies.  %%%  The acquisition of this analytical equipment will add an  important facet to this advanced microstructural analysis  facility.  Now, the microstructural and mechanical property  data can be directly linked with the alloy chemistry.  Once  a database has been established with this information, it  will be possible to design alloys with very specific  microstructures and properties without having to enter into  a detailed experimental matrix; that is, an expert system  can be developed that provides the alloy chemistry and  processing parameters that will yield a material with the  desired properties on the first experiment.  Currently, such  a system does not exist.  ***",
