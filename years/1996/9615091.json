The purpose of the two workshops is to discuss and recommend curricular developments to meet the educational needs of tomorrow's analytical scientists.  The Pittcon sessions are proposed as opportunities to engage a larger audience of scientists in discussions of the current status and the future directions in analytical sciences.  A 6-8 member steering committee will be formed to provide advice on the contents and help select participants for the workshops and the Pittcon sessions.  The committee will be comprised of active and well-known scientists, educators and leaders from 2- and 4-year colleges, graduate level institutions, and technology-based industrial companies.  The two workshops will be held in the Fall of 1996 and the Spring of 1997 at a location in the Washington, DC area.  Some 24-30 participants, representing stakeholders in the education and training of analytical scientists, mainly at the undergraduate level, will be invited to each workshop.  The product of this project will be two reports.  The first one will be written in the style of an \"executive summary\" to describe the contents and outcome of the first workshop.  The second report will be more extensive and will state the problems with background information, and the recommended solutions, as defined and determined by the workshops.  These recommendations are intended to provide the framework for the \"restructuring\" of the education and training of analytical scientists to meet current and future needs.  Implementation of curricular changes will require the cooperation and support of academic institutions, technology-based industry, government agencies, and professional societies.",
