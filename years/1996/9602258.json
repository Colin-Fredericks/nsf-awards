 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program of training envisioned by the ASU group involves  a comprehensive set of activities including formal  coursework, laboratory introductions, a seminar series with  strongly participatory elements, and an evaluation structure  for monitoring the progress of each individual student at  regular intervals.  Overall this portion of the team's  presentation was a strength of the program.  It is clear  that the group took the training function seriously and  spent considerably energy developing a highly ambitious  program of training with many innovative features.  Obviously they have collectively evaluated those factors in  the training of advanced students in interdisciplinary areas  which are likely to be most valuable and have attempted to  include those in the proposed  program..  Comments below on  the individual elements of the training program are meant to  help the team fine-tune the approach, rather than to detract  from the overall enthusiasm with which this portion of the  presentation was received.    The program of formal coureswork, consisting of a laboratory  and lecture course along with a seminar series with serious  participation by the students is very ambitious and highly  original.  The lecture course seeks to provide an overview  to all of the students  entering the program in a given year  of the broad issues in biophotonic devices from a top-down  reverse engineering perspective.  The strength of this  course is that it has the potential to provide a very broad  perspective to students at an early stage in their graduate  careers, before they have had time to develop disciplinary  prejudices, which limit vision in more traditionally trained  students.  The danger, and one which is explicitly  recognized by the team, is that any particular topic will be  very deep for most of the class and relatively shallow for a  small segment.  The inclusion of a section on intellectual  property issues  from a legal perspective introduces an  element of \"real world\" consideratio ns which is responsive  to currently popular concerns about the relevance of  traditional academic training.  The laboratory course,  designed to expose students to a broad survey of issues  important to biophotonic device manipulation, is very  challenging, perhaps too much so for a group of students  with the diverse backgrounds expected of students entering  the program.  If carefully designed this highly ambitious  experiment in graduate laboratory work could be a  cornerstone of a new way of thinking about interdisciplinary  training, which could be extended to other universities and  other programs.  However, it is clear that there are  practical issues, e.g., length of time of produce workable  mutants, familiarity with simple chemical synthetic  manipulations, etc., which need to be more carefully thought  out.  In both of these formal course experiences it is  important that the ASU administration has agreed to add the  proposed activities to the portfolio of courses currently  offered so that the assignment to either of these courses  does not come as an overload, which would detract from the  overall effectiveness of the faculty member involved.                The seminar program aims to place students in real contact  with a variety of external experts and should prove to be a  valuable addition to the formal training program.  Students,  under direction of the course director, are to carefully  read and discuss the work of a selected set of speakers  prior to their talks and should be well-poised to benefit  from the on-campus presence of the speaker.  In addition the  multidisciplinary project meetings should be extremely  positive experiences for the students in the program.  These  meetings which will have the character of an extended group  meeting promise to allow students from diverse backgrounds  to delve into details of a research problem on a common  footing but from their own different perspectives.  In short  they are, just the kind of experience many of them are  likely  to have as parts of research teams in the industrial  environment upon graduation.      Recruitment/Woodbury         This is an ambitious program that will need a very high  quality of students that have a broad background and much  curiosity, ambition, and drive.  Recruitment into the  program will occur at two levels.  In one, students will be  attracted to come to A.S.U. because they want to come into  this program.  However, students will also be recruited out  of the current pool of general applicants to science and  engineering.  The goal is to attract 6 students per year  from 5 departments (3 in arts and sciences and 2 in the  school of engineering).  There is no provision for students  to transfer into the program after their first year in  graduate school.         Standard recruitment strategies are largely in place.  There are good, innovative programs for attracting minority  students.  The current enrollment has a high proportion of  students that are eligible for support by N.S.F.  There is  good faculty commitment to recruiting visits.  The college  makes an investment in bringing students in to visit the  college.  They have mechanisms to contact applicant that  they hope to attract by email during the time the students  are making their decision.  Current students talk of being  attracted to the university by coming on visits and meeting  interested faculty.  This program, by the excitement of the  intellectual offerings it provides should prove help them  ensure that the best students accept offers at A.S.U.         The difficulty is to find entry level students that are  interested in this particular program.  The average A.S.U.  graduate student might not be interested in this ambitious  program.  However, the faculty quality is more than  sufficient and there is a number of students in the existing  program who would meet the ambitious needs of the program.  They will need to get a few of the most ambitious students  from each of the 5 departments to join the program.  One   challenge may be to make sure that the allocation of  training positions is spread out equitably among the  departments.          Thus, recruitment will require students to be directed  to this unusual and exciting program.  Recruitment of  students of students may be best achieved by word of mouth  within the scientific community.  The visiting scientist  component of the grant can also serve as a recruitment  mechanism, since when colleagues return to their home  institutions they will send their best students.          However, in order to maintain the right students it  will be important to maintain program's focus so that this  remains a high visibility offering at A.S.U.",
