 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612255    Wise   A multi-disciplinary investigation of the interactions of ultrashort light  pulses with optical glasses is proposed by a team of scientists from  Cornell University and Corning, Incorporated. The primary goal is to  develop a thorough and systematic understanding of the  fast optical  nonlinearities that are the physical basis for a wide variety of optical  devices and systems. Third-order nonlinearities excited by laser pulses  consisting of only a few cycles of the electromagnetic field will be  studied in a variety of experimental glasses. Since glasses are typically  Raman-active, the nuclear contribution to the nonlinear optical response  must also be considered. The absorptive and refractive third-order  nonlinearities will be measured with 10-fs pulses, with the specific goal  of isolating the electronic and nuclear contributions to the nonlinear  response. Using the knowledge of individual processes gained in these  studies, the nonlinear and dispersive propagation of ultrashort pulses in  glasses will be investigated theoretically and experimentally. Experiments  will utilize pulse durations ranging from 10 to 200 femtoseconds in a  variety of glasses to study the effects of group velocity dispersion,  stimulated Raman scattering, multiphoton absorption, the finite relaxation  time of the electronic nonlinearity, and the breakdown of the  slowly-varying envelope approximation.    A secondary theme of the proposed work is the relation between the local  structure of a glass and the relaxation of vibrational and electronic  excitations in the glass. The dephasing of vibrational modes and the  relaxation of electronic impurities excited by short optical pulses will be  studied using both time- and frequency-domain experiments; in each case the  results will be correlated with the local structure.    Graduate students involved in this work will participate in an innovative  education program that includes a multi-disciplinary course curriculum and  assignments to work on t he synthesis and characterization of glasses at the  Corning location for one month each year. This experience will provide the  students with a broad foundation in the optical physics and material  science of glasses as well as giving them substantial exposure to  industrial research.  ***",
