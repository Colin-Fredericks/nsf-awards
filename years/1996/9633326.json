 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633326  Laub    Standard approaches to measuring the condition of various  problems in control theory, such as solving an algebraic   Riccati equation (ARE), compress all sensitivity information into  a single condition number.  Thus, a loss of information can occur  in situations in which this standard condition number does not  accurately reflect the actual sensitivity of a solution or  particular entries of a solution.  In this project we shall  investigate a new method that overcomes these and other common  deficiencies.  The new procedure measures the effects on the  solution of small random changes in the input data and, by  properly scaling the results, obtains condition estimates for  each entry of a computed solution. This approach, which is  referred to as small-sample statistical condition estimation  (SCE), applies to both linear and nonlinear problems.  In the  former case (for example, when solving a system of linear  equations or a linear least squares problem), an explicit Frechet  derivative of the computed quantity is available.  Thus the  method is especially efficient and, in fact, costs no more than  standard normwise or componentwise estimates. Even in the  nonlinear case (for example, solving AREs), considerable  efficiencies are gained when iterative improvement by, say,  Newton's method is available. SCE also has the advantage of  considerable flexibility.  For example, it easily accommodates  restrictions on, or structure associated with, allowable  perturbations. The method has a rigorous statistical theory  available for the probability of accuracy of the condition  estimates. Finally,it is emphasized that SCE lends itself readily  to straightforward implementation into many existing computer-  aided control system design software packages.  ***",
