 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of  nine  undergraduate students each year in the Research Experiences for  Undergraduates program offered by the California Academy of  Sciences' Summer Systematics Institute.  The program is ten weeks  long and recruitment on a national level will give emphasis to  women and minority students in science.  Each prospective intern  would apply to work with an Academy curator on a research  project.  Successful applicants would take part in formal  lectures in Systematic Biology, tours of each of the Academy's  nine research departments and research seminars in systematic  biology by scientists from outside the Academy.  Students would  work on directed programs circumscribed so that an introduction  to the problem and organisms to be studied, as well as data  collection, interpretation and dissemination can be accomplished.  Each student will produce a manuscript of the project's results  in the form of a scientific paper and will make an oral  presentation of  his/her results to peers.  Evaluations of  interns and participating Academy staff will be conducted each  year to fine-tune/improve the program for subsequent years.       This award will foster the continued education and training  of individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic  researchers in systematic biology.  It will also help to inform  young citizens about issues related to biological diversity and  its preservation.",
