 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624882  He  Semiconductor optoelectronic devices, such as laser diodes, light emitting  diodes, optical waveguides, electrooptic modulators, and photodetectors,  have important applications in optical communication and control systems  because of their convenience, efficiency, and natural compatibility with  modern electronics. Research on high performance semiconductor  photodetectors using low temperature (LT) deposition technology is proposed  for the PI's career development plan. The PI's current research focuses on  the study of the microstructural and electrical properties of LT thin metal  films. The most important characteristics of the low-temperature deposited  thin metal films, compared with conventional room temperature deposited  films, are: (1) tremendously increased Schottky barrier height; and (2)  greatly lowered resistivity when they are very thin (less than 100 A); both  of which are superior qualities for many optoelectronic devices, such as a  metal semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodiode, which is one of the best  choices for high-speed photodetectors.    The proposed research plan is to (1) explore the electrical characteristics  of LT thin films on several new semiconductor materials, including InGaAs,  AlGaAs and SiGe, which are often used for photodetectors; (2) implement  this technique to device fabrication; (3) optimize device design; and (4)  carry out the device fabrication and characterization. It is anticipated  that the application of the low-temperature thin metal films will result in  a significant enhancement of device performance. Such a high-performance  photodetector will have an important impact in optoelectronic integrated  circuit (OEIC) technology.    The goal of the PI's education plan is to educate productive engineers for  today's industrial and academic needs and to provide newly developed  technology to aid students' professional development. Concurrently with the  PI's research program, two senior elective and graduate level courses in  optoelectro nic devices, as well as semiconductor material and device  characterization are being developed by the PI in the Department of  Electrical Engineering at Northern Illinois University. Innovation in these  courses will focus on the development of laboratory components for both  courses, which will provide a strong synergy between the PI's research  program and education goals.  ***",
