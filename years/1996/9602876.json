 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602876  Tolbert    This award supports the participation of 10 U.S. academic  participants in a U.S.-Japan seminar on New Aspects of  Photoresponsive Materials, to be held at the Catalina Island  Conference Center, California, from November 4-8, 1996. The  co-organizers are Professors Laren Tolbert and Gary Schuster  of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta and Professor  Masahiro Irie of Kyushu University.  The theme of the  proposed seminar was chosen in order to highlight recent  advances in the use of light to bring about changes in the  properties of materials.  Such materials may be used in  optoelectronic devices, such as imaging, memory, and display  devices, as well as so-called \"smart\" materials which mimic  the light-driven responses of living systems.  These include  changes in color (\"photochromics\") as well as changes  leading to actual motion (\"optomechanics\").  Of course, the  ultimate light-driven biological response is photosynthesis,  and this represents a continuing focus of activity in both  countries.  Fundamental discoveries in each of these areas  are being made both in U.S. and in Japan, and increased  exchange of ideas and information between these two groups  is clearly essential to maintaining a high level of  intellectual output.  The U.S. participants provide a broad  cross section of expertise and geographical representation  in the area of photochemistry, photophysics, and materials  science, and were selected on the basis of being the most  active researchers in the U. S. while providing a diverse  range of interests. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through international collaboration.  ***",
