 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601453  Zhang      This award supports continued development of a cooperative  research and education program between RPI and the Institute  of Physics, Beijing.  This recommended award is supplemental  to the PI's CAREER award through the Division of Electrical  and Communication Systems.    The research involves generation of intense terahertz  radiation that will open new research areas in the  characterization of electrical, optical, and optoelectronics  materials and devices. Applications are also likely in  characterization of biological materials for medical  applications. Many technical benefits are associated with  this cooperation with China.  The Chinese group has  acknowledged expertise growing and cutting the nonlinear  crystals which are essential to the research., and has state  of the art laser facilities, enabling them to carry out  significant parts of the experiments. Chinese scientists,  supported by Chinese funding sources, will be trained  further at RPI in ultrafast electronics.  The benefits to  both sides are substantial and equitable.    An important part of this program is the participation of  graduate and undergraduate US  students. Based on the  success of a one-year pilot program, the PI proposes to  extend the opportunity to up to sixteen students over the  next four years to participate in a research program  involving experiments conducted both at RPI and in China.",
