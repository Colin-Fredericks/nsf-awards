 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop general chemistry class is being developed that  includes experimental work during every meeting. Lab work is  merged with classroom discussion. Students working in groups  are challenged to link their macroscopic observations to  chemical principles. The merger of thirty-minute, concept-  based discovery labs with discussion and lateral development  material provides a unique perspective of chemistry.  In  modernizing the general chemistry curriculum, fewer topics  are treated and the more esoteric aspects of physical  chemistry that are inappropriate for freshmen are  eliminated.  More time is allocated to materials chemistry,  organic and biological chemistry, and environmental science.  The course material is organized into modules or case-  studies that contain material which is developed with the  specific aim of showing the relevance of the material to  problems to which the students already have been exposed.  Societal relevance is built into every module of the  syllabus by incorporating laboratories, discussion and  \"lateral development\" problems for each topic.",
