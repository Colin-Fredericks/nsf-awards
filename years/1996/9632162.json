Localized in the thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria, algae and plants, PSI is an integral component of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, and mediates transmembrane electron transfer from plastocyanin or cytochrome c6 to low potential acceptors such as ferredoxin. PSI is a large pigment-protein with eleven polypeptide components. In addition, cofactors such as quinones, iron sulfur centers, carotenoids and nearly 100 chlorophylls are present in this protein complex. The PSI complex from cyanobacteria has been crystallized and its structure is currently known at a resolution of 4.5 A. The long range goal of this project is to understand, in molecular terms, the biogenesis and function of PSI. The experimental organism is Synechocystis 6803, a unicellular, naturally transformable cyanobacterium, that offers a versatile genetic system to study this protein complex. The PI's lab has recently identified BtpA, a novel protein in Synechocystis 6803, that is not a structural component of PSI, but regulates the assembly of its catalytically active core complex. The specific aims of this project are: (1) To determine the cellular location of the BtpA protein. (2) To elucidate the function of BtpA by isolating and analyzing suppressor mutants that restore the assembly of the PSI core complex in btpA mutants. (3) To investigate whether BtpA is a membrane-bound molecular chaperone. (4) To examine whether BtpA acts as a translational activator protein. (5) To elucidate the basis for temperature sensitivity of a BtpA mutant in the assembly of PSI.  %%%  By harvesting solar radiation, the PSI complex provides half of the energy for biomass production in our world. Most, if not all, of the structural proteins as well as the redox components of PSI have been identified. The current challenge is to understand the mechanisms that control the stoichiometric assembly and function of this membra ne protein complex. During this project, tools of genetics, biochemistry and biophysics will be combined to pursue this challenge. Understanding the biogenesis and function of this supramolecular complex will also make important contributions to the general knowledge about such large protein complexes in other biological membranes.  ***",
