 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511850  Humanic       Research will be carried out in relativistic heavy ion  nuclear physics. Experiments will be conducted at the CERN, AGS,  and RHIC heavy ion accelerators.  The main goal of these  experiments is to obtain evidence that collisions of relativistic  heavy ions with sufficiently high energy produce a phase  transition from normal nuclear matter into a new phase of matter  made up of a large volume of free quarks and gluons.  The above  named accelerator facilities provide a range of energies needed  to raise the energy density to more than ten times normal nuclear  matter density, thought to be sufficient to produce deconfined  quark and gluon matter.  Experiments will be designed and carried  out which look at the signatures of a quark-gluon plasma as  reflected in particle momentum distributions and multiplicities  of each type of particle produced.  Development work will be  carried out for purpose of producing a detector system with  sufficient individual particle tracking and identification  capability to handle the huge particle multiplicities expected  from central heavy ion collisions.  Some calculations will be  carried out to determine expected interaction regions within the  colliding systems.  In addition, lower energy charge exchange  reaction measurements will be completed which bear on the density  dependence of nucleon-nucleon interactions.  Research in these  areas will advance our understanding of the underlying quark  model of nucleons and mesons.  These topics are among the most  exciting in nuclear physics.  Education of graduate students and  postdocs is integral to this activity, as is development and  construction of major state-of-the-art equipment  ***",
