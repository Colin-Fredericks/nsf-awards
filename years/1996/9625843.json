 "awd_abstract_narration": "Erneux  9625843       The investigator studies a series of mathematical problems  connected with singular perturbation and bifurcation problems.  The project is divided in three distinct parts.  A.  Slow passage  problems: He analyzes the slow passage through resonance in a  solid state laser and the slow passage through locking in a  semiconductor laser.  Both problems are motivated by current  experimental work.  B.  Laser instabilities: Many practical lasers  are known to exhibit damped or sustained pulsating oscillations.  He investigates a series of specific problems and develop  asymptotic methods for their description.  C.  Biological and  medical problems: He works on three different problems, one  involving coupled chemical reactions, a model for bursting  oscillations, and a class of moving boundary problems modeling  the controlled release of pharmaceutical drugs.  The common  difficulty is the failure of a standard quasi-steady state  approximation.       The investigator studies a series of practical problems that  are difficult, long, or expensive to investigate by using  traditional experimental methods.  This is the case for many  commercially used lasers that exhibit undesired instabilities and  for new pharmaceutical devices that allow long releases but are  poorly understood physically.  Many of these problems are  described by mathematical models that are studied numerically.  These numerical simulations can be long because the models depend  on several parameters or because of numerical difficulties.  The  main goal of the project is to determine analytical solutions of  these problems that may then reduce or guide the numerical  simulations.  Each specific problem described in this project  (lasers - biology) is motivated by current collaborations with  experimental groups or with biophysicists.",
