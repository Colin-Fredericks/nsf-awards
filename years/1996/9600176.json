 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600176  Covault       This proposal intends to create the first step in  making a ground-based air Cherenkov detector for  astrophysical gamma rays in the energy interval from 20 to  200GeV.  It intends to adapt and utilize a portion of the  very large solar and to install a receiving device (PMT's)  in the existing solar furnace tower.       The educational project portion also seems attractive  and sensible.  He will involve a graduate student and  several undergraduates in the research on what seems like a  sensible time scale and at appropriate levels.  Additionally, there is a classroom/laboratory component to  his proposal.  Building on the work of others (most notably  Eric Mazur) he intends to introduce the \"rapid feedback\"  lecture method of Mazur's \"Classtalk\" into a course for non-  science students he will be teaching.  This idea has been  successful in several places but would be new to Chicago.  It requires some hardware, installation and shakedown use  but he has accounted for that (see below).  He is also  proposing to introduce CCD \"photography\" methods into the  Chicago advanced undergraduate labs.  Both of these projects  seem valuable in advancing instruction there and to be of  manageable scope.       The proposer has had experience appropriate to this  work from both a particle physics and astrophysics  perspective.  He has worked in both astronomy and in  particle astrophysics and has been an active participant in  the preliminary work for STACEE.  ***",
