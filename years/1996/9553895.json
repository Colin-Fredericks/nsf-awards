The Building Bridges partnership  consists of the three districts and seven research and development  centers including American Cyanamid, Bristol Myers Squibb and Union  Camp.  Additional science and education expertise will be provided  by faculty from Princeton University, scientists from Sigmi Xi, the  American Physical Society (APS) and AAAS, Trenton, N.J.    When this staff development initiative is completed every  elementary teacher including ESL, bilingual and special education  teachers in all three districts will be employing the inquiry  approach to the teaching of elementary science grades K-6.  The 5  year project will target 574 teachers in 15 schools.  40 mentor  teachers will be assigned to school districts in proportion to  size.  26 volunteer teachers have already begun to pilot FOSS,  Insights and STC science modules in their classrooms.  They will  then make recommendations for adoption by the school board.    Total Request of $1,722,000 is from NSF.  Cost Share is $5,292,078.",
