One of these impacts arises  from the emission of \"black\" or \"elemental\" carbonaceous aerosols  from the exhaust of diesel-powered generators and vehicles used  to support Antarctic operations.  When deposited on the snow and  ice cover, this pollutant may be preserved indefinitely.  Its  high optical absorption will alter the surface albedo and the  radiative properties of surface cover.  Its ability to  catlytically promote certain chemical reactions may lead to  modifications of snow and ice chemistry.  Its absorbed content of  fuel-derived organic species such as polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons and other toxics may have a deleterious effect on  marginal biota and near coastal stations.  Previous work showed  that extremely small, but detectable, concentrations of black  carbon aerosol are brought to the South Pole station in the  background atmosphere in amounts consistent with models of long-  range transport;  however, this program terminated in 1990.  A  1986 study of surface snow and ice showed a clear plume of soot  description downwind of the station.  This project proposes to  install more modern equipment both upwind and downwind of the  South Pole station to re-establish the background aerosol  measurements and to provide a direct assessment of the station's  emissions.  The results of this work will contribute to the  determination of the station's environmental impact resulting  from combustion-derived emissions.  This information may be used  as input to mitigation and abatement strategies.  The upwind data  will contribute to the global monitoring record, and to  assessments of the global circulation of anthropogenic emissions  capable of influencing atmospheric optics and chemistry.",
