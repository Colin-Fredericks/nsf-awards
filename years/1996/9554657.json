 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project promotes a way to encourage undergraduate work on  \"real-world\" problems culled from sources outside the academic  environment. Funds will support a workshop/symposium on  undergraduate consultancy programs to bring together those with  experience in consultancy programs, those who wish to start such  programs, and representatives from industry, business, and  government. Not only is there growing evidence of the educational  merit of such activity, but it has the added advantage of tying  more closely the non-academic world with the world of undergraduate  mathematics.  This fosters a greater appreciation of the role which  mathematics plays in solving problems which routinely arise in  situations where the applicability of mathematics is not fully  understood. This workshop will take an important first step in  extending the opportunity offered by consultancy work, in a  curricular context, to a much wider population of undergraduates.   Until now, only large institutions with the in-house resources to  support such programs could offer them.  Creating organizational  infrastructure and taking advantage of electronic communication are  required, and are available, to open up the opportunities of a  vital research-like activity to small colleges and universities  with limited resources.",
