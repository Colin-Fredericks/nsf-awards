Parents may  influence their offpring s fitness directly by influencing  offspring survival, or indirectly by influencing offspring  phenotypes.  A combination of field manipulations and  natural controls will be used simultaneously to obtain  estimates of natural variation in parental behavior, the  direct and indirect effects of parental behavior on  offspring fitness, and the strength of selection acting on  parental behavior through offspring fitness.  D. pumilio  display a discreet form of bi-parental care in which males  care for the eggs until they hatch and females care for the  tadpoles from hatching through metamorphosis.  This research  will investigate the effects of distinct male and female  parental behaviors (manipulated and natural) on offspring  growth, development, and survival.  In Project 1, the  frequency of feeding events and number of nutritional eggs  provided per feeding event will be manipulated to determine  the effects of variation in these natural behaviors on  offspring.  In Project 2, experimental manipulations in  field enclosures will be used to investigate the effects of  parental behaviors including hydration, protection from  fungal infection, and defense against predators and  parasitoids on egg development and survival.",
