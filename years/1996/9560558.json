Technological innovation is required to effectively manage dilute sources of air pollution from industrial operations and remediation of contaminated groundwater and soils.  Emissions controls are needed which are cost effective, use energy efficiently, are suitable for remote locations, and produce no hazardous by-products.  Photocatalysis potentially has these characteristics, employing ultraviolet (UV) light to destroy chemical compounds at ambient temperatures and pressures.  Photocatalysis would be particularly attractive if an efficient solar technology were available, exploiting inexpensive and abundant UV radiation from the sun.  To date, solar photocatalysis has not been sufficiently efficient or effective for large scale adoption. KSE, Inc., the proposing firm, has developed novel photocatalyst formulations which are about 50 times as active as conventional titania photocatalysts.  The efficiency of use of solar radiation in the W spectrum should be greatly increased by such photocatalysts.  The objective of the Phase I research is to establish the technical feasibility of exploiting these unique photocatalyst formulations to capture the potential of solar radiation for the destruction of environmentally hazardous gaseous emissions in air.  The performance of the photocatalysts to be developed will enable effective utilization of solar UV radiation and efficient scale-up to capacities of relevance to practical applications.  Phase I will focus on chlorinated volatile compounds (CVOC's) and toluene as model compounds, with extension in Phase II to the full spectrum of industrial hazardous emissions.   The environmental control equipment market in the United States is forecast to grow to sales of $1.6 billion by the year 2000.  The solar photocatalytic air pollution control products to be developed will find broad application in that marketplace.  Initiall y, solar photocatalytic units will be installed to control air emissions from soil and groundwater remediation due to the superior economics and ready adaptability to remote locations.  Future products will address industrial tailpipe emissions control and indoor air quality maintenance.",
