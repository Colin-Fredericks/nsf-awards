The students will study a number of NSF engineering projects which have a significant K-12 teacher preparation focus.  They will determine the impact of these projects on the teacher preparation community and will investigate effective ways in which these types of engineering/teacher education collaborations can be promoted and implemented.  They will present their findings at the American Society for Engineering Education's national conference.",
