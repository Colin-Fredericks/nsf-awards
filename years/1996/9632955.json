It provides an important and   highly stimulating opportunity for the exchange of new ideas among   researchers and workers in statistics, chemistry and chemical   engineering.  In order to further the exchange of ideas, the 1996   Conference will, for the first time, be held outside the US, in Oxford   (UK).  This will bring US scientists in contact with the leading   scientists in the fields of statistics, chemistry and chemical   engineering in Europe.  The 1996 Conference will work along two lines.   On the one hand, outstanding statisticians present novel and   up-to-date topics relevant for chemists and chemical engineers and on   the other hand, outstanding chemists and chemical engineers present   real-life problems and proposed solutions.  This approach maximizes   the interaction between the different groups: chemists and chemical   engineers learn new statistical methods and statisticians hear about   complex real-life problems.   %%%   The Gordol Research Conference on Statistics in Chemistry and Chemical   Engineering lies on the interface between statistics, chemistry and   chemical engineering.  Hence, the conference attracts a broad spectrum   of participants.  The resulting cross-fertilization of ideas from   different areas of science and engineering significantly benefits all   participants.  Research statisticians are exposed to real problems in   chemistry and chemical engineering; applied chemists and statisticians   learn first hand about new statistical research which they can use in   their everyday work; and research chemists and chemical engineers can   discuss their statistical ideas with eminent statisticians.   Statistical methodology, as covered in this conference, provides   important quantitative tools in numerous fields of research, including   meeting national goals for improved competitiveness in the chemical   industries via  enhanced product quality and productivity, and   recognition and avoidance of environmental hazards.  This conference   will allow open presentation and discussion of recent research on the   frontiers of statistics and its relevance for all areas of chemistry   and chemical engineering. ***",
