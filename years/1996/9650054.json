 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is expanding the laboratory component of an introductory physical science course for \"non-science\" majors, including education majors.  It creates a laboratory that allows \"non-science\" majors to experience hands-on the methods and purposes of physical science.  The project is providing instruments for computer acquisition, graphing, and analysis of experimental data and for computer acquisition and analysis of video recordings of experiments.  It also allows students to spend more time planning, executing, and reporting an independent investigation of a self-selected topic in physical science.  The project is allowing more students to graduate from college with an understanding, based on personal experience, of the methods and purposes of physical science.",
