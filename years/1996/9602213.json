 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Albert Nerken School of Engineering, constructed in 1957, is one of three schools at Cooper Union.  The department's philosophy focuses on engineering as a field of study directed to the practical solutions of problems that effect contemporary life. Four traditional disciplines of study:  chemical, civil, electrical, and mechanical are included in the curriculum in conjunction to innovative cross-disciplinary fields, such as biomedical, environmental, materials, and manufacturing engineering, are integrated into the structure.  To assist the department  in achieving its research and research training goals, the National Science Foundation, in partnership with Cooper Union, will provide funds for the renovation of space on the sixth floor of the structure for environmental and bioengineering.  Currently, the laboratory is antiquated with inadequate ventilation.  Renovation will consist of asbestos removal, electrical and plumbing work, a modern HVAC system, and installing new fume hoods, lab benches and cabinets.  Space will be reconfigured to provide the department with seven laboratories dedicated to environmental and bioengineering research. Areas of concentration include: (1) asphalt technology; (2) soil/sludge bioremediation and treatment; (3) biotechnology separation research; (4) biomechanics; (5) room safety testing; (6) low light level microscopy, video imaging, digitization; and, (7) bioanalytical and environmental applications of a biosensor. Upon completion, this project will improve research capabilities by  fostering advances in urban environmental engineering, providing students with opportunities to learn new technologies for the 21st century, and encouraging interdisciplinary research.  Having a large base of women minority students, this project will attract under-represented students to these specialized fields of study.",
