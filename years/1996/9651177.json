 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry is implementing a model laboratory-based science experience for non-science-majors. This enhancement includes the purchase of the molecular biology components needed for the newly developed laboratory. The initial audience for this course is made up of incoming students in the university's Honors and Scholars program. These high-aptitude students represent an ideal audience for ascertaining whether topical, highly interesting coverage, usually reserved for upper-level science courses, can be presented at the introductory level.   The structure of the course highlights the laboratory experience. This approach is novel and perhaps radical in that it approaches the curriculum, in the area of molecular science, from the top down. The assumption that computer modeling can support this approach is being tested. Students take part in a cloning project in which the gene for bioluminescence is transferred from one bacterium to another. They learn the concept of `molecular fingerprinting` by comparing the molecular characteristics of two micro-organisms. This fingerprinting idea is then applied to the analysis of self-selected samples using modern instrumental analysis. It is expected that the student not only develop an appreciation for, but also an understanding of, the nature of science, especially the excitement that accompanies discovery. The order of laboratory exercises specifically addresses issues related to the development of abstract concepts from concrete experiences.   The success of this project may serve as a model for the development of similar laboratory focused courses for non-science-majors. Such courses may have a major impact on addressing the issue of science literacy.",
