Proposal No:  96-33633    Title: On a Dynamic Balance Theory of Photosynthetic Pigment  Regulation in Unicellular Algae:  Tests of  a Novel Hypothesis                                                                                                  ABSTRACT                      Environmental  control  of  photosynthetic  pigmentation  in  microalgae  is  hypothesized  to  depend  on  a  simple   control  mechanism   operating  around  photosystem   II   dynamics.   The  mechanisms  responsible  for photoacclimation  of  photosynthetic  pigments  have  eluded researchers for more than  5  decades.   A  \"dynamic  balance\" theory of photoacclimation is described  based  on  general behavior of the photosynthetic apparatus in  constant  and  fluctuating environments. This novel theory is the first  to  explain  how  pigment concentrations are optimized over  a  broad  range of light, nutrient, and temperature environments.        The  proposed research will directly test the dynamic balance  theory.   Four  taxonomically  diverse  microalgal  species   are  targeted for investigations. Controlled growth experiments  under  differing  photoacclimative conditions will provide a  basis  for  relating  photosynthetic response, pigmentation, and  photosystem  II  dynamics. It is anticipated that experimental support for the  theory  will  lead to the development of models  combining  other  known  photosynthetic regulatory mechanisms, resulting in a  more  general   appreciation  of  constraints  on  photosynthesis   and  mechanisms of energy balance in photosynthetic organisms.",
