 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stuart       The investigator studies the numerical approximation of  problems that change in time and are modeled by ordinary or  partial differential evolution equations.  Two fundamental issues  arise in this context.  The first is, given a numerical simulation  of a problem that evolves in time, how should the data obtained be  interpreted: under what circumstances, and in what sense, is the  computed data close to the data generated by the underlying  differential equation? The first component of the project is  concerned with studying this question in the context of the  complicated algorithms used by software codes; this is primarily  an analytical study requiring an understanding of the  discontinuous dynamical systems generated by these algorithms.  The  second fundamental issue is how to effectively design numerical  methods that enable given questions about the equations to be  answered efficiently and in a way that yields new insights.  The  second component of the project is concerned with studying this  question in the context of dissipative partial differential  equations and, in particular, developing computational techniques  for connecting orbits; equations such as the Ginzburg-Landau  equation and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation are studied.         Many problems in science and engineering can be edfectively  modeled by means of differential equations of evolution.  In  practice these equations cannot be solved exactly and  computational approximations must be sought.  Two important issues  arise in this context: (i) ``what is the relationship between  computer generated data and the real problem we wish to  understand'' and (ii) `` how can efficient algorithms be developed  to obtain the type of information that sheds most light on the  questions of interest.''  These two issues are addressed in this  project in a variety of different contexts.  For the first a very  broad class of algorithms is studied with potential impact on many  areas of science and engineering, including  molecular dynamics  simulations, planetary interaction simulations and other  interesting evolution problems.  For the second a number of  particular problems are studied that arise from, for example,  models of transition to turbulence in fluids and models of  complicated combustion processes.",
