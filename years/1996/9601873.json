This system will include two laser, four-  color capability, and a sorting system.   Also included is a  computer, data analysis software, and a data storage system.  Flow cytometry is now an essential technology for modern  oceanographic studies. Flow cytometry is the best method for  rapid analysis of the picoplankton, organisms less than 2  p.m in size, which are the dominant autotrophic and  heterotrophic plankton in most open ocean environments.  Faculty in the Oceanography Department at Texas A&M  University currently have funded projects based in both the  North Atlantic and North Pacific central gyres which would  utilize the capabilities of the flow cytometer to analyze  picoplankton populations. Other  research projects in the  Department of  Oceanography which  would benefit greatly  from this instrument include the study of the  cell division  in eukaryotic marine phytoplankton, the analysis of  picoplankton cultures, plankton studies using molecular  probes, coastal studies of nitrifying bacteria, and stable  isotope studies of the microbial loop.  An annual training  course in the theory and use of the flow cytometer would be  offered to undergraduate and graduate students, and this  facility will be used to attract graduate students to Texas  A&M.  A plan for management of the facility is also  outlined.  ***",
