The Arctic Environmental Data Directory (AEDD) was assembled as a subset of the Earth Science Data Directory of the U.S. Geological Survey.  AEDD contains more than 400 references to data sets, each of which has been reviewed for completeness, consistency, and accuracy.  Data sets described cover many disciplines including geophysics, hydrology, geochemistry, oceanography, cartography, atmospheric physics and chemistry, marine and terrestrial biology, health and medicine, contaminants, remote sensed data, and in situ data.  AEDD resides on a computer system accessible to scientists, policy makers, educators, and the interested public over the Internet.                                                            Diary Note    Subject:  Arctic Environmental Data Directory (AEDD) Proposal      This proposal is for continuation of funding support for the project activities of the AEDD Working Group for 1996-1997.  The AEDD Working Group is comprised of members of IARPC agencies, and academic representatives.  These activities include:    Maintenance of the AEDD, including entry and review of new data-set descriptions, updates to existing entries, personal-computer hardware and software;    Internet access to AEDD on a Unix server located in offices of the U. S. Geological Survey in Anchorage, Alaska;    Development of an international counterpart to AEDD, the international Arctic Data Directory (ADD) with partner organizations initially in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Russia;    Coordination with and links to related data-management activities such as the Global Change Master Director and the ADD;    Outreach and information dissemination, including sponsorship  of and participation in workshops, conferences, and meetings involving agencies, academics, the Arctic Research Commission, the IARPC, and international partners;    Liaison with related U.S. and international environmental programs.      This project supports the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee (IARPC) response to recommendations of the Arctic Research Commission on Arctic Data and Information.          Charles E.
