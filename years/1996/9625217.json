 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problems of interference detection are fundamental in  computational geometry, solid modeling, robotics,  manufacturing, computer graphics and computer-simulated  environments. These include collision detection between  geometric models undergoing motion, surface intersection  between linear and curved surfaces, collision avoidance for  robot motion planning, visibility computations, hidden  surface removal and boundary computations.    This research takes a three-fold approach to these problems  using algebraic, numeric and geometric techniques:    1. Develop fast and robust algorithms for interference  detection between geometric models in static and dynamic  environments. The set of models include polyhedra, splines,  algebraic surfaces and deformable objects.    2. Specialize these algorithms to interactive collision  detection, hidden surface removal, surface intersection and  boundary computation with special emphasis on robustness.    3. Develop efficient software libraries for interference  detection between moving polyhedral objects, solid models  defined using algebraic surfaces and boundary evaluation.  The resulting libraries will be distributed as public domain  code and demonstrated on different applications.    The research efforts will be complemented with the following  educational goals:    1. Development of undergraduate and graduate courses on  geometric, symbolic and scientific computing.    2.  Develop novel teaching methods and electronic course  notes using the World-Wide Web (WWW) technology.    3.  Use of graphics, geometry and animation tools to develop  an algorithm animation and programming laboratory for  undergraduate courses.    4. Serving as a mentor to high school and undergraduate  students to work on graphics and modeling related projects  in our laboratory.  ***",
