 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent development of FISH (chromosome painting) technology has  revolutionized radiobiology. The interpretation of the large amount of  FISH data now being collected on chromosome aberrations can be greatly  facilitated by computer codes modeling the mechanisms involved.    Chromosome aberrations are molecular rearrangements following DNA  double strand breakage. They are relevant to cell death, DNA damage  repair, carcinogenesis, biological dosimetry and most other aspects of  radiobiology.  Significantly for this grant, aberration yields are  influenced by large-scale chromosome geometry during cell-cycle  interphase, and act as probes for the geometry. The geometry dependence  is in the form of \"proximity\" effects, i.e. effects caused by  chromosome localization within a cell nucleus and by spatial  limitations on DNA double strand break induction or interactions.    With the advent of (FISH), a rich spectrum of detail has become  available in the 90's on various kinds of aberrations, including quite  complicated ones. It is non-trivial to evaluate systematically the  implications of the yield pattern for chromatin geometry and for the  mechanics of double strand break reactions, because of multiple DNA  double strand break interactions, of the dependence of yields on  individual chromosome arm lengths, and of influence of radiation track  geometry.  In addition, different experiments often use different  painting schemes, making more difficult intercomparisons or comparisons  to older, non-FISH experiments.    However, Monte Carlo methods are well-suited for analyzing the  molecular reshufffling problems involved, and a code has been developed  by  members of our team and coworkers which gives  methods for  interpreting data, comparing experiments, and predicting; it uses only  one adjustable parameter (corresponding to the radiation dose), and  gives good results for some experimentally observed ratios, e.g. when  comparing chromosomes of different lengths for aberration yields.    Thi s algorithm does not incorporate the proximity effects discussed  above, although there is clear experimental evidence, involving the  ratio of ring aberrations to exchange aberrations or the ratio of  complex aberrations to simple aberrations, that such a generalization  is needed. Moreover, the code is applicable only to sparsely ionizing  radiation, not to densely ionizing radiation, whose known geometric  properties can lead to additional geometric information about the  biological target.  Consequently the code is not yet useful for  analyzing the relations between aberration yields and chromosome  geometry.  The object of the grant is to develop better algorithms,  which do incorporate geometric effects, and check them experimentally.    The simplest new algorithm will incorporate proximity effects by an  extension of the present code with just one extra adjustable parameter  (for a total of two). Further extensions of the algorithms will use  recently published data and quantitative models for large-scale  interphase chromosome structure and cell nucleus ultrastructure.  In  addition, up-to-date algorithms for simulating ionizing radiation  tracks will be developed and included, as will a number of technical  refinements.    The resulting algorithms will be tested by chromosome aberration  experiments which use different cell types and different FISH painting  schemes in a controlled comparison. The code will also be compared to  experiments using sparsely or densely ionizing radiation reported in  the literature from various laboratories, world wide. The algorithms  will be used to critically test and extend modern models, including  polymer models, for large-scale chromatin geometry during the Gl phase  of the cell cycle.  The work will be a joint effort by scientists with  primary training in radiobiology, mathematics, cytogenetics, or  radiation biophysics. Individual team members have extensive  interdisciplinary experience in programming for biology.  The  algorithms developed will  be important for the increasing number  of  scientists using FISH technology to study DNA damage processing,  to  probe chromosomal structure, or in applications.",
