 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of  ten talented  undergraduate students each year in the Research Experiences for  Undergraduates program offered by the Microbiology Department at  the University of Texas, Austin.  This program, which encompasses  10 weeks each summer will allow the students to work in well-  funded and equipped laboratories in which the research being  conducted covers both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems and  deals with membrane localization, DNA replication and  recombination, control of gene expression, immunological  mechanisms, pathogenic mechanisms and viral transformation.  Participants will work individually with faculty mentors but have  access to all faculty through seminars and informal discussions  in a format which is similar to that of previously supported  successful programs.  This new award will emphasize acquainting  students with the variety of post-graduate opportunities for  students interested in molecular biology.  Activities are geared  to promote interest in research careers and encourage students to  apply to graduate schools in molecular biology.       This award will foster the continued education and training  of individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic  researchers in the biological sciences.",
