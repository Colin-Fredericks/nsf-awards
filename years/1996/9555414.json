 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nation's undergraduate education system has often labeled the mathematics curriculum as a \"filter\" that removes many motivated and talented students from further study in science, engineering, and technology. At the institutional level, this filter is built by an interdisciplinary culture with poor communications among departments, lack of support for curricular activity, different and distinct expectations of the curriculum, and lack of plans for student growth and learning across the curriculum. To transform the ''filter'' into a \"pump', for student success, a change in the culture of the mathematics, science, and engineering teaching communities must occur. The activities in this project which are affecting the necessary change build on successes of schools comprising the consortium. Workshops are being conducted that enable faculty to use projects, design curricula, model student growth, and present \"lively\" pedagogy.      The project is developing programs where students learn skills in computing, writing, reasoning, and problem solving. The project vision is to establish environments conducive to interdisciplinary cooperation for designing and presenting instruction in all \"partner\" disciplines. Interdisciplinary projects are being used as a vehicle to move in stages from disconnected mathematics courses to a fully integrated experience in all partner disciplines. Teams at each institution consisting of faculty from several disciplines are collaborating to develop course materials, termed Interdisciplinary Lively Applications (ILAP). A core set of ILAP material has already been developed primarily at West Point and implemented over the past several years.  Several types of ILAPs are envisioned beginning with the basic ILAP Project and culminating in ILAP Carry-Through Projects.     The consortium is representative of all types of the nation's undergraduate institutions: two-year colleges, liberal arts colleges, engineering schools, historically black colleges, and research universities . Through these joint efforts of the institutions involved, the project is affecting thousands of undergraduate students by making a lasting cultural change through national dissemination of our activities. The ultimate goal is to develop an interdisciplinary culture that acts like a \"pump\" sending students into mathematics, science, and engineering.",
