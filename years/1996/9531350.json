Two types of projects will be offered: five-week summer projects for students who have completed their sophomore years, and year-long projects for students who have completed their junior years.  All students will present the results of their work at the Keck Research Symposium in Geology.  Twenty sophomore and six junior students of minority heritage and eight minority faculty will be recruited nationally to participate in the Keck Geology Consortium program.  Students of color who participate in this program can test their interest in geology early in their academic careers, obtain excellent credentials for employment or further study, and become part of an extended network of students and faculty that will aid them as they move into the professional world.  Past experience indicates that these students will continue successfully into advanced schooling or careers in geology.",
