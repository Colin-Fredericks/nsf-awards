 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two groups, the Imaging Systems Laboratory (ISL) of the University of Colorado  and the Laboratorio de Optica, (LO) in the Departamento de Fisica y Matematicas  of the Universidad de Los Americas, are pursuing a joint research program to  further develop and demonstrate tools for the design of integrated  optical/digital imaging systems.  This program combines the capabilities of the  two groups and focuses their efforts by concentrating on the reduction of the  longitudinal region of focus of an imaging system.  That is, an optical/digital  imaging system is to be designed that has a greatly reduced depth of field or,  equivalently, a dramatically increased resolution along the longitudinal axis.   Based on previous research by the two groups, it is believed that this goal can  be achieved without adversely affecting the transverse resolution.  Indeed, it  appears likely that, with a combined optical/digital system, the transverse  resolution can also be increased somewhat.  Such a system would be useful in  microscopy, medical imaging, and in inspection devices for manufacturing.    In addition to the scientific advances and potential new imaging systems, the  interaction between the graduate students in each group and long-term (one month  to one semester) visits to each others' institutions will greatly promote  international cooperation in the field, and understanding between the two  cultures.",
