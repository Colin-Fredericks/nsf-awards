 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the investigation of effective  algorithms for some major problems of polynomial and matrix  computations.    One of the main subjects of the current project is the study  of approximating polynomial zeros, which has recently  resulted in the design of new solution algorithms running in  optimal time (up to polylog factors). The optimality has  been reached under both Boolean and arithmetic and both  sequential and parallel models of computing. The project  includes the work on extension of the latter results to  other major problems of algebraic and numerical computing,  such as computing approximate common divisors of pairs of  univariate polynomials, approximation of matrix eigenvalues,  solving systems of polynomial equations, and algebraic  optimization problems.    Another major direction of the project is to continue and  extend the  work on computations with structured matrices,  which have applications to numerous major practical and  theoretical computational problems, including the areas of  speech and signal processing, Markovs chains, fundamental  algebraic computations with general matrices, and the  solution of partial differential and integral equations.  ***",
