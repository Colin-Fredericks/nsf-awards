 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), jointly  funded by the Theory of Computing (TOC) Program, CCR, by  Computational Biology Activity, BIR and by the Systemic  Biology Program, DEB, addresses problems in the construction  of phylogenies or evolutionary trees.   The formulation and  effective solution of this problem requires a collaborative  multidisciplinary effort from biologists, statisticians and  computer scientists.   The ideal methodology for solving  this problem would include the following steps:(a) Observe  data on the species that exist today; (b) Identify a  biological model (such as the Jukes-Cantor model or Kimura  two parameter model); (c) Based on the model from Step (b),  design an objective function and efficient optimization  methods for this function so that the tree that optimizes  this objective function is the tree that best fits the  model. Unfortunately, this ideal program is impossible to  realize, because of roadblocks at every step: (i) Data is  subject to experimental error and to errors due to its  interpretation and use in phylogeny construction  methods;(ii) It seems difficult to identify a precise  biological model for evolution; (iii) Given the stochastic  model of evolution, one candidate for the optimizing tree is  the ``most likely tree''.  Given the uncertainty of what is  actually the ``best'' model, a most likely tree under one  model should still be a very likely tree under a slightly  different model.   Demonstrating this has proven to be a  very difficult problem.  The goals of this SGER proposal  include:(1) Modification of the ideal methodology so that  Difficulties(i) -- (iii) are removed; (2) Testing of various  models using r-RNA and tufA sequence data supplied by a  molecular biologist; (3) Using the experimental results,  design of general methods for inferring phylogeny;(4)  Comparison of these new models with existing models for the  data.  In addition, one of the goals of this SGER award is  to initiate a multidisciplinary effort  between the  biologists, statisticians, and computer scientists at the  University of Pennsylvania.***",
