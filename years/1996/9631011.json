In the last Nicaraguan election of 1990 voters defeated the socialist Sandinista incumbent who had governed the nation since the 1979 revolution and installed Violeta Chamorro and UNO, an administration committed to a capitalist, democratic regime.  Analysis of survey data from 1990 demonstrates that voters based their decision not only on concerns present in established , democratic elections, such as the candidates, the economy, and the issues - but also on an assessment of the governing legitimacy of the Sandinista regime.  the continuing instability and polarization  of Nicaraguan politics in the 1990s, much of which surrounds the creation of a new Constitution, indicates that the 1996 election may also focus upon questions of regime legitimacy as well as on candidates, the economy, and specific issues.  The upcoming election thus offers a chance for extensive examination of vote choice in a transitional democracy where regime legitimacy has already proven to be a significant electoral issue in deposing an entrenched government.  The election also offers an intriguing opportunity to contrast voters' concerns about the legitimacy of a capitalist democratic regime in 1996 with the types of concerns raised with respect to a socialist democratic regime in 1990.  The research  pursues this broad contrast and numerous more specific concerns by collecting new public opinion data prior to and immediately following the 1996 election and comparing its results with the 1990 data.    At a broader and more comparative level, the findings of the project point toward critical questions that will prevail in comparative politics over the next generation of research:  Do voters judge and interpret regime legitimacy and the role of the state differently in capitalist versus socialist democracy?  What concerns predominate in new post-socialist democracies and in new post-authoritaria n democracies and how do these compare with concerns in established democracies?  In its transition process and in the contrast between 1996 and 1990 Nicaragua offers one of the first opportunities to study the electoral dynamics that may define politics in other new democracies over the next decade.  ***",
