 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to correct the deficiency of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instruction in the teaching laboratories. A 200-MHz NMR spectrometer, dedicated to undergraduate laboratory instruction, is being connected by ethernet to an existing silicon graphics server, one of a network of computers maintained for undergraduate instruction. Students in Introductory Organic Laboratory, Organic Honors Laboratory, Physical Chemistry Laboratory, Advanced Instrumental Methods Laboratory, and Undergraduate Research have hands-on experience with this instrumentation. Spectral data can be transferred from the spectrometer to the server, and students can analyze these data from computer terminals located in one of the instructional computer laboratories. By this procedure, students spend only that amount of time operating the instrument necessary to collect data and yet are able to spend as much time as necessary analyzing the data from computer terminals without occupying the instrument. This important analytical instrument thus serves a much larger body of students than it would if students also occupied the spectrometer while analyzing the data that they have already collected. This project also makes available on the server several molecular modeling and spectral simulation programs so students can calculate exchange rates from NMR lineshape analyses and evaluate energy-minimized models in terms of their consistence with NOE and J-coupling data.",
