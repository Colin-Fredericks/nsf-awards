 "awd_abstract_narration": "9512831  Zelevinsky       The proposed research is aimed at clarification of key  problems in collective phenomena and quantum chaos.  Quantum  chaotic dynamics is a common phenomenon in many branches of  physics.  The knowledge accumulated in the model studies has  to be applied to realistic quantum systems.  The first steps  are already carried out in physics of atoms, molecules and  disordered solids.  Nuclear structure and reactions give a  generic example of a quantum many-body system with strong  interaction where we can make progress both in understanding  quantum chaos and in specific problems of nuclear physics.       The applications include onset of chaos in nuclei;  common features and differences between \"one-body\" and \"many-  body\" chaos; coexistence and complex interplay of regular  and chaotic dynamics; damping of collective motion; phase  transitions, thermalization and decoherence in a closed  mesoscopic system with no external heat bath; chaotic  dynamics and collectively in an open system with finite  lifetime and in loosely bound nuclei; enhancement of weak  interactions in compound states.  Application to other  systems including random meson fields and the structure of  physical vacuum also should be explored.",
