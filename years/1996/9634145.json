Avoid use of first person to complete this summary. DO NOT EXCEED ONE PAGE. (Some Programs may impose more stringent limits.)    The maize crinkly4 (cr4) gene encodes a receptor kinase involved in the development of leaf epidermis and the aleurone of kernels (Becraft et al., in preparation). The novel extracellular domain contains a 39 amino acid repeat motif and a cysteine-rich region with similarity to the extracellular ligand-binding domain of mammalian tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). A nucleotide probe containing the extracellular domain coding sequence hybridizes at low stringency to several genomic fragments in both maize and Arabidopsis, thus cr4 represents a new gene family. The objectives of the current proposal are twofold: 1. to initiate attempts to isolate the signal molecule by direct molecular techniques and 2. to characterize this gene family in Arabidopsis. The latter will also result in the isolation of the cr4 cognate gene which will be used to develop a genetic system to study the CR4 receptor and possibly to identify the signal molecule.    The similarity between CR4 and the ligand-binding domain of TNFR suggests that CR4 probably also binds a peptide signal molecule. Toward the first objective, a phage display library will be constructed using RNA from leaves at the stage when the mutant phenotype first becomes apparent. The library will be screened by biopanning for clones encoding peptides bound by the extracellular domain of CR4.    Members of the cr4 gene family will be isolated by screening an Arabidopsis genomic library at low stringency with the extracellular probe from the maize cr4. The clones will be used to examine expression of the Arabidopsis genes by RNA gel blot analysis. These probes will also be used to genetically map the genes and obtain cDNA clones  which will be sequenced. Sequence comparisons among Arabidopsis gene family members and with the maize gene will provide clues to functionally significant amino acid motifs. Particular, attention will be paid to the TNFR-like domain. The cr4 cognate gene will be determined from structure and sequence similarity, and become the focus of longer term studies comparing the developmental role of cr4 in Arabidopsis with maize and to functionally dissect the CR4 protein. This could also provide a tool for genetic screens to identify the signal molecule if direct molecular methods are unsuccessful.    NSF FORM 1358 (1/94)",
