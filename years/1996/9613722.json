 "awd_abstract_narration": "9613722  Sanchez-Sinencio  The main goal of this proposal is to identify, characterize, model, and design algorithms and devices that are essential in wireless system applications, using a unified approach.  This involves a (top-down) hierarchical design all the way from the system point of view, to the transistor level implementation.  Tradeoffs between system architecture, BiCMOS circuit implementations, cost, power consumption, and performance at different levels will be identified.  This research will yield important practical results that form the basis for many wireless communication products, and specifically those to be used for the upcoming personal communication systems (PCS) and in communication over the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands.  The tradeoffs in building complete wireless communication products in integrated circuit form, versus hybrids (with off-chip components) will be a key component of the proposed research.    This work proposed in this proposal encompasses theory, software simulation, and hardware implementations.  The uniqueness of the approach is based on the coordinated effort of two groups with proven accomplishments in communications and microelectronics circuits.  Heavy interaction between both faculty members and graduate students from the two institutions proposing this project is expected.  The Texas A&M University contribution will be in the communication system architectures, multiple-access techniques (i.e. CDMA, TDMA, etc.), signal processing algorithms, mixers, and active and passive filters.  The INAOE contribution will be mainly in the BiCMOS circuit design of key building blocks.  These blocks include the front-end low noise amplifier (LNA), power amplifiers, channel encoders/decoders, and correlators.  The feasibility and performance of the proposed designs will be verified first by software simulation involving tradeoffs, experimental verification b silicon chip-prototypes of important building blocks, and some system applications resul ts.    A successful conclusion of this proposal research will lead to practical, unified design methodologies for designing wireless communication systems, especially those for PCS and unlicensed devices operating in the ISM bands.  Contributions at the system, building block, and hardware levels and their interrelations are anticipated.  This research will have an important effect on the infrastructure of wireless research and education in our universities, since a significant number of students are already involved.  Funding for these students will come not only potentially from the support requested in this proposal, but also from present support, exceeding half a million dollars, from the College of  Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M University, as well as from Texas Instruments, over the next three years.  The utility and relevance of the proposed research is based on substantial industrial ties, and strong exchange of ideas between academia and university.  ***",
