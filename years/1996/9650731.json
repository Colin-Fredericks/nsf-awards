 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes DNA sequencing and sequence analysis modules in nonmajors biology labs (500 students per year), 7 majors freshman biology labs (200 students per year), upper-division genetics lab (20 students per year), and in the proposed Forensic Science Molecular Biology lab (20 students per year). The department is also upgrading the existing undergraduate DNA Sequencing and Sequence Analysis class (16 students per year) and upper-division and graduate-level classes where sequencing is already a component of the labs (40 students per year). Undergraduate research involving DNA sequencing is also being upgraded. In order to accomplish these goals, the department is obtaining a high sample capacity, fluorescent DNA sequencer. This machine, together with student-tested, hair-follicle polymerase chain reaction protocol, allows a very large number of non-science-majors and freshman biologists to amplify, sequence, and analyze a portion of their own DNA.   Experiments like this are essential to achieving a greater public understanding of the uses and limitations of molecular biology in general and genome and DNA analysis in particular. In the upper-division courses, this machine is improving the quality of instruction by allowing students to learn automated sequencing as well as manual sequencing. The high capacity of the machine and the fact that it does not involve radioactivity also allows a much larger number of upper-division students to sequence in either the advanced lab classes or as part of their own research. The results of this project will be widely disseminated because of the large number of students involved. The students co-author papers and present abstracts and talks which will ensure a broad dissemination to the professional community. Finally, community college students in the Summer Bridge to the Baccalaureate Program and middle and high school students in the Saturday College Program can also learn about sequencing and sequence analysis in this project.",
