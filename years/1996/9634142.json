On February 21, 1996, a large earthquake struck under the sea off  the northern coastal region of Peru, triggering a tsunami which  swept into the port of Chimbote with 3 to 5 meter waves,  destroying fish processing plants and more than 50 houses, and  which was recorded by tide gages at Easter Island (60 cm) and  Hawaii (25 cm).  The information gathered to date point to it  being a \"tsunami earthquake\" -- a term resulting from the 1994  Nicaragua earthquake to indicate an earthquake which is unusually  efficient in producing tsunamis.  A thorough investigation of  \"tsunami earthquakes\" and their effects is critical in terms of  hazard mitigation, and valuable in light of recent theoretical  developments in fault rupture mechanisms.    The reconnaissance team will gather essential tsunami-effect  information including runup, flow patterns and velocities,  tide-gage records, structural damage, scouring effects, sediment  transport, intensity of ground shaking, the effect on estuaries  and nearby lakes, and any secondary effects caused by this  earthquake and its associated tsunami. The team will attempt to  follow the recommendations for survey methodology and procedures  established at the 1995 Tsunami Measurement Workshop in Estes  Park, Colorado, as well as the 1995 Tsunami modelling Workshop in  Friday Harbor, Washington.    Because international tsunami researchers are currently involved  in a reconnaissance of another large tsunamigenic earthquake (Mw  8.2) that occurred along the northern coast of Irian Jaya,  Indonesia, on February 17, 1996, this Peru tsunami reconnaissance  team will be relatively small.  However, the findings of this  team will be announced widely through the Tsunami Bulletin Board  -- an Internet mailing list initiated and maintained by the NOAA  Pacific Marine and Environmen tal Laboratory (PMEL) in Seattle.  Immediately after the survey, a brief report will be disseminated  via the Tsunami Bulletin Board, with the final results being  published, and also posted on the University of Washington World  Wide Web tsunami home page. All the gathered data will be  available upon request.  ***",
