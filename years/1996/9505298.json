Beard/Abstract  9505298         The effectiveness of evaporation ice nuclei (EIN) will  bestudied in laboratory simulations of cloud drop formation,  charging, evaporation and reentrainment in cumulus clouds  developing through the freezing level.  Such nuclei are potentially  effective ice nuclei because of organic and inorganic materials in  cloud drops.  Charge accumulation at cloud top is a source of ice  nucleus enhancement by electrofreezing.  For the proposed nuclei  continuous-flow experiment, cloud drops will be obtained from cloud  condensation nuclei (CCN) using laboratory mixing and cloud  chambers and the Illinois State Water Survey continuous flow  diffusion-chamber system, and from ultrasonic nebulization of aloud  water.  Cloud drops will be charged using a corona device and  evaporated by mixing with dry air.  The activation (threshold)  temperature of the resultant nuclei will be measured in the  presence of condensing, supercooled drops that act as condensation  freezing nuclei as a function of temperature.         The EIN electrofreezing mode will be evaluated by measurements  at several charge levels, and the EIN evaporation-freezing mode  will be deduced from measurements using EIN particle generated both  warmer and colder than freezing.  A separate set of nuclei activity  measurements will be made to distinguish contact-freezing from   condensation-freezing by using an evaporating cloud in the freezing  chamber, so that contact of nuclei is enhanced by phoresis and  condensation-freezing is suppressed.         A complete set of experiments is planned using nebulized cloud  water that has been collected during research flights.  Another  complete set of experiments will be conducted with cloud-water  formed on CCN using the continuous flow diffusion system with  corresponding chemical analysis.  The nuclei experiment and the  diffusion system will be transportable so that measurements can be  made at various locations in the future.",
