For the  specific geometries of a three-dimensional cylinder or a two-dimensional  rectangle, the spatial decay of solutions of elliptic partial differential  equations (or systems of equations) arises in consideration of the classic  Saint-Venant principle in elasticity theory.  Such problems also arise in  entry flows for viscous incompressible fluids.  Generalizations to   include principles of Phragmen- Lindelof type are also of interest.  In this proposal, it is planned to analytically investigate a sequence of  boundary-value problems for second-order and fourth-order elliptic partial  differential equations.  Both linear and nonlinear, isotropic and   anisotropic problems are considered.  The results of such investigations have widespread technological impact.  In particular, rigorously obtained asymptotic estimates for the rate of   decay of solutions of continuum mechanics problems are immediately applicable  in engineering analysis and design.  The problems to be investigated  involve mathematical models for advanced composite materials and structures.   %%%    Structures of technological interest such as automotive and aircraft parts,  rocket casings, helicopter blades, hollow shafts and containment vessels,  are often constructed of layers of anisotropic, filament or fiber-reinforced   materials which must be designed to remain elastic.  The proper analysis   of such structures in current high-performance technology requires careful  mathematical analysis of basic issues.  It is proposed to study the safe  and efficient performance of these  structures using results from the theory   of partial differential equations.  In particular, simplified,  cost-effective asymptotic methods will be used.  The scope of the  investigation will include both linear and nonlinear problems, and one of  the underlying goals is that of efficient use of  materials.  It is known, for  example, that considerations of nonlinear effects in composites often lead  to striking differences from predictions of linearized theories.  In view   of the rapid utilization of advanced composite materials in current   technology, mathematical studies on large deformations of such materials  promise to have widespread impact on the mechanics and materials knowledge  and technology base.  Applications to specific composite architectures  of interest, for example, to the Boeing Company and NASA will be made.    ***",
