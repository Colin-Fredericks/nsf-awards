 "awd_abstract_narration": "9555808  Musil    For over 20 years, efforts have been made to recruit and retain more women in science, math, and engineering.  It is time to move from climate to content.  \"Women and Scientific Literacy: Building Two-Way Streets\" will  transform the content and teaching methods of the science curriculum as it is taught both within traditional science  departments and within humanities and social science courses. Campus teams at institutions with strong women's  studies programs will design faculty development opportunities to teach new courses based on the scholarship in  gender and science. To assist faculty in their work, there will be a national Advisory Board serving in a  consulting  capacity; two national conferences on curriculum and pedagogical development; a newsletter filled with curricular  examples and resources; a moderated e-mail discussion list; and annotated bibliographies.    In order to increase science literacy both inside science and in non-science fields, this project will encourage the  development of new college courses.  New science courses will include more information about women and science  and women s studies courses will discuss more questions about how women have participated in the scientific  enterprise. A resource book will be published to help others develop new courses.  ***",
