 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to address a fundamental scaling dilemma that plagues  ecologists and resource  managers. Many current issues are concerned with processes  operating on scales of landscapes or regions. But our  conventional knowledge base is comparatively fine-scale. For  example, anthropogenic climatic change broaches issues of  regional (biome) or even larger-scale importance, but our best  empirical understanding of the mechanisms of ecological response  is at the level of the individual plant. Resource managers face a  similar dilemma: multiple-use or ecosystem management implies  scales of watersheds or landscapes, yet our knowledge base for  forest management is founded at the level of individual trees or  homogeneous stands. In general, scaling involves a trade-off  between resolution (grain, or level of detail) and extent (the  area or scope of the study). Large extent comes at the expense of  fine-grained resolution of detail, and so, studies that focus on  details do so over a small spatial domain, while large-scale  studies typically sacrifice detail to embrace coarser-resolution  patterns.    This scaling trade-off can enforce an incompatibility across  scales. Large-scale studies typically are based on different  conceptual models and different data, as compared to fine-scale  studies. While it might be assumed optimistically that models  derived from different empirical bases at disparate scales might  nonetheless converge at a common scale, in practice such models  cannot be compared rigorously because they have too little in  common. We propose to develop a suite of simulation models which  address questions at different scales while still maintaining a  consistent conceptual and empirical basis. By preserving this  commonality among models, we can change scale rigorously as  needed, and when using alternative models we can be confident  that discrepancies in the predictions of these various models are  due to explicit assumptions or formulations rather than to  unknowable incompati bilities in the underlying data.    We will begin with forest gap model, which simulates the  establishment, growth, and mortality of individual trees on a  small (<0.1 ha) model plot, at an annual timestep. Gap models  typically are used to extrapolate tree-level demographics to  stand-level (~10 ha) dynamics over successional time periods. We  will then use this model to generate and parameterize three  derived models (metamodels) that reproduce selected  coarse-resolution aspects of the gap model's behavior, but do so  with much greater computational efficiency. We propose to  demonstrate this approach with a nonlinear stage-structured  model, a semi-markovian patch transition model, and a cellular  automaton. Each metamodel emphasizes a different aspect of forest  dynamics, and so each is amenable to particular kinds of  applications.    We have selected the forests of the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as a  testbed for the development of this methodology, but the  resulting methods will be applicable to a diverse range of forest  ecosystems. In particular, our gap model is already in use in the  northwest, southwest, northeast, and the southeastern United  States. The approach should also be applicable to other types of  models. We will make our models and documentation available to  other users.",
