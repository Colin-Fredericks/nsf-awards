The  project is an industry-university collaboration between  Stanford University and IBM Almaden research center,  especially Dr. Barbara Jones.  The investigators are using  both analytic calculations and extensive numerical  simulations to understand giant magnetoresistence of the two-  dimensional electron gas.  The project also includes  interaction with the experimental colleagues at both IBM  (such as Dr. Stuart Parkin) and Stanford (such as Prof.  Charlie Marcus), and interaction with the IBM development  and manufacturing divisions in San Jose to understand long  term issues and share developments.  The project represents  a synergy between research in magnetism, semiconductors, and  mesoscopic physics.  Successful completion could eventually  benefit the computer industry by integrating magnetic  recording with the semiconductor devises.  It will also  educate and train a new generation of young physicists with  both the capability of pure research and the experience of  industrial development.  %%%  This project is part of the Grant Opportunities for Academic  Liaison with Industry (GOALI) initiative at NSF.  The  project is an industry-university collaboration between  Stanford University and IBM Almaden research center,  especially Dr. Barbara Jones.  The investigators are using  both analytic calculations and extensive numerical  simulations to understand dramatic changes in semiconducting  interfaces due to the application of an external magnetic  field.
