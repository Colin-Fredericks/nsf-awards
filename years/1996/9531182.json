 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531182  Chung  Present theory is based on incorporating a new concept of  vertical pipe connecting to a miner and application of  external (control) force on the pipe for the control of pipe-  miner motions.    Modeling of an entire pipe-miner system pin-joins a  horizontal pipe to the long, near-vertical pipe system and  to a self-propelling seafloor miner.  The elastic joints  along the pipe can be made effective in changing the axial,  as well as, bending characteristics.  To apply external  (control) forces to the joints for the control of the  lateral motion of the pipe, the flexible joints will be  modeled by finite element (FEM), as well as combined (rigid  body) element (RBE).  The accuracy and advantages of the two  methods will be compared.  The pin joint leads the entire  system to zero eigenvalue and rigid mode, and the weight, as  the inner axial force of the vertical pipe, further  influences the eigenvalues of the entire system.  A shift  technique will solve this problem.  The proposed 3-D  nonlinear coupled responses with nonlinear axial dampers  installed at the joints will reduce the axial stress and  also influence the bending and torsion, as well.  Soil  (sediment) resistance for the miner will be modeled by both  DEM (discrete elements) and FEM.  The DEM modeling will use  a mass of discrete particles of general geometry.  Preliminary modeling of soil particles indicates that DEM  modeling is very promising to examine micromechanical  details of the soil particles.  ***",
