 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622136    This work, a collaboration between researchers at Cornell  University and  the University of Oklahoma, is focused on developing  understanding about  the mechanisms of rock fracture in compression.  The  research involves  formulation and testing, with unique experiments and  computer simulation,  necessary to identify the evolution rules for the stable  growth of  three-dimensional cracks of arbitrary shape in brittle and  rock materials.  A laser will be used to induce three-dimensional cracks in  transparent  specimens.  These specimens will be tested under compressive  loading to  induce stable growth and crack interactions.  With  transparent material,  structural instabilities can be easily observed.  Based on  the test  results, three-dimensional crack propagation criteria will  be formulated.  An existing computer simulator will be applied and extended  for fully  three-dimensional crack growth and interaction.  Evolution  rules for crack  growth will be programmed into this simulator, which allows  arbitrary  trajectories of single internal cracks, cracks interacting  with free  surfaces, and with each other.  The hypothesis to be tested  within this  objective is that, using computer simulation, an acceptable  rule is one  that will be able not only to reproduce experimental  observations, but also  will be able to predict evolving crack shapes in additional  proof tests  before performing them.  ***",
