 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520251  H. Schmidt    The  PI  will investigate properties of partially disordered materials  in  particular of proton glass crystals and relaxor ferroelectrics.  A  broad  range of measurements, such as dielectric spectroscopy  from  1  mHz  to  1 GHz, third-order dielectric permittivity, hysterisis loops,  field heating and zero-field heating, and Brillouin scattering will be  conducted at Montana State. Neutron scattering and diffraction will be  carried  out  at  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory.  Phenomena  to  be  investigated  include smearing of the phase transition and  clustering  in  relaxor ferroelectrics, nonergodic behavior, phase coexistence and  proton  tunneling  in  proton glasses. Proton glass  results  will  be  interpreted  in terms of the bound charge semiconductor  model  and  a  phonon-assisted    tunneling    model.   A   diffusion-barrier-limited  conductivity  model  and  other appropriate models  will  be  used  to  interpret  the relaxor ferroelectric behavior. Monte Carlo simulations  of proton glass behavior will also be performed.  %%%  Partially disordered crystalline materials, in which atoms of one type  are  replaced by those of another type, at random sites in the crystal  will  be  investigated. The focus is on materials which  show  unusual  response to electric fields. These include proton glasses, mixtures of  ferroelectric    crystals    which    polarize    spontaneously    and  antiferroelectrics which consist of oppositely polarized  interlocking  parts.   Relaxor  ferroelectrics  which  have  pronounced   mechanical  response  to  an electric field, and are beginning to find application  as  sensors  and actuators will also be studied. The objective  is  to  understand  the  fundamental properties,  including  the  response  to  electromagnetic  fields  of  very low to very  high  frequencies,  the  effects  of heating and cooling, and the structure of these materials.  Attempts  will  be  made  to  improve  upon  existing  conceptual  and  mathemat ical models of these materials.  ***",
