 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will   assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona acquire a   hybrid mass spectrometer (MS) with an electric sector (E)-magnetic   sector(B)/curved field reflection time-of-flight (TOF) geometry. This   equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the   following: (1) design and synthesis of a variety of biologically active   linear and cyclic peptides, pseudopeptides, peptidomimetics and complex   peptide libraries (2) structure/physical property/reactivity   relationships in hemes and heme proteins  (3) studies of the enzyme and   compounds that mimic features of the molybdenum and heme centers of the   enzyme (4) synthesis and characterization of new organic compounds (5)    synthesis of carbohydrate based natural product analogs and the   development of novel carbohydrate based materials (6)  design and   synthesis of novel amphiphilic molecules that form organized assemblies   upon solvation  (7)  novel organic snthesis methodology to synthesis of   novel materials, and (8)  mechanism of lipid transport in insects.  Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural   details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of   organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of the   technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to proteins and nucleic   acid molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of   electrospray ionization in combination with high resolution provides the   latest techniques available in mass spectrometry.  It affords the chemist   one of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of   compounds. The acquisition of this capability in mass spectrometry is   essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many fields of   chemistry.",
