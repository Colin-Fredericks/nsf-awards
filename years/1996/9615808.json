It is based on the investigator's recent  work, in which he successfully employed some classical constructions  of algebraic topology and differential geometry to reveal the  geometric content of ordinary cohomology as well as smooth and  holomorphic Deligne cohomology.  The investigator plans to apply the ideas  contained in his previous research on Deligne cohomology to study the  structure of the image and the kernel of the cycle homomorphism.  Some  of the deepest and most important problems of transcendental algebraic  geometry concern the cycle homomorphism.  The most celebrated among  these is the Hodge conjecture.  Except for a few classes of very  special algebraic varieties, codimension one is the only codimension  in which complete cohomological and geometric descriptions of the  image and the kernel of the cycle homomorphism exist.  The investigator  intends to pursue extensions to all codimensions of structures   playing a central role in the codimension one case.  In particular, he  introduces generalized exponential sequences and a new cohomology  theory that is conjecturally dual to Chow groups of algebraic cycles  modulo rational equivalence.  The objective of this project is to  verify that conjecture.  If this is the case, then the cohomology long  exact sequence of the generalized exponential sequence will induce a  complete cohomological description of the image and the kernel of the  cycle homomorphism.       Projective varieties are geometric objects defined by means of   polynomial equations.  Like other notions that arise in many important   contexts and sound deceptively simple, for example, the ordinary whole   numbers, they possess properties that are not at all obvious or easy to   discover, and over the course of many years, mathematicians have been   led to develop elaborate algebraic machinery for making computations   concerning some of  these properties.  It is hard to remain in touch with   the geometric meaning of these computations, and this is what has given   rise to the current project.  The investigator will attempt to understand   a geometric structure of what are known as algebraic cycles.  This will   be done by extending some classical techniques of algebraic topology and   differential geometry to the context of algebraic geometry.  One might   say that at least this one corner of algebraic geometry will be reintroduced   to its roots.  This will be not only an esthetic triumph, but an aid to   intuition and thus to further discoveries and advances in mathematics and   in the disciplines like theoretical physics that make use of this   mathematics.  ***",
