 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today, all areas of technology use signal processing.  The applications range  from adaptive coding of speech signals, to analysis of medical images, to echo-  canceling in cellular telephones.  The successful implementation of signal  processing algorithms in both software and hardware is a result of research into  various aspects of signal processing, including analysis, modeling, synthesis,  algorithm development, tool development, and implementation.  This workshop in  intended to bring together a distinguished group of research scientists and  educators to explore the expanding role of signal processing within applications  that include the telecommunications infrastructure and the expanding information  highway.    The workshop will meet for 3 1/2 days to assess and document recent advances and  current and future research directions in signal processing.  During this time  we expect to prepare recommendations for research activities and to initiate a  debate on the future directions of the field from among the research community.   Participants will be drawn from academia, industry, and companies whose products  include significant signal processing components.  The goal of the meeting will  be to develop a vision statement for the field and determine areas which have the  potential for high payoff in terms of application areas.  The participants will  also discuss ways of integrating signal processing research results and  applications into the undergraduate engineering curricula - \"the integration of  research and education.\"  Another important topic will be the discussion of ways  to promote public awareness of the pervasive role of signal processing.",
