 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oglesby, Elizabeth  U. of California, Berkeley   This study will focus upon the dynamic expansion of sugar plantations on Guatemala's south coast.  The reason for this expansion, in contrast to developments elsewhere in the Third World, lie in the contextual responses to local social conflicts and the exercise of social and political power waged at multiple levels.  The work will study the imposition of new forms of labor stabilization on these plantations including scientific management and the automated construction of migrant labor markets.  The research will examine how methods of industrial labor control are transposed onto agrarian social and labor relations.  Using ethnographic research at the level of the household the process of negotiation and contestation between migrant workers and management over a stable yet flexible labor force will be revealed.  An aim is to identify the negotiations at the household level which reveal how migrants create their own flexible labor strategies.  The product will shed new light on aspects of agrarian change with global implications.",
