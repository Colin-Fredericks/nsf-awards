 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Enhancement of Faculty Design Capabilities\" proposes a series of  design education workshops and a National Conference on Engineering  Design and Design Education.  The two-week summer workshops, to be  held in 1996 and 1997 at Southern Methodist University, are offered  for all engineering disciplines and faculty that intend to or are  presently teaching design in engineering courses to undergraduate  students.  The workshops strive to address needs of faculty from  two-year and four-year institutions who teach non-design, or  engineering science, courses and desire to include design into the  course work.  Topics addressed in the workshops include design  methodologies, design content, design constraints, design tools,  and teaching design through a multifaceted format using lectures,  laboratory sessions, discussion sessions, and industrial tours.   Participants will develop a design plan, design problems, design  projects, and design case studies while working individually, in  single-discipline teams, and in multi-discipline teams.  Faculty  leaving the workshop will have a design plan, design materials for  courses, a plan of implementation at the home institution, ald a  network of design faculty with whom to interact.  These workshops  will guide faculty to a different way of thinking, a freshened  approach to processes and procedures of design synthesis.  It is  anticipated that the National Conference on Engineering Design and  Design Education to be held in Spring, 1997 will mark the creation  of a continuing forum for exchange of ideas between engineers and  educators on engineering design and design education which can be  continued on a two-year cycle.",
