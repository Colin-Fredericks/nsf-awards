 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Lindblom will continue his theoretical research on  gravitation and astrophysics.  He will emphasize  astrophysical situations in which strong gravitational  fields play a significant role.  These problems can be  divided into four major areas:  a) the pulsations and  stability of relativistic stars, b) superfluid hydrodynamics  in neutron stars, c) dissipative relativistic hydrodynamic  theories, and d) fundamental mathematical problems in  relativistic stellar structure.  Specific research problems in each of these areas will be  carried out, for example: a) A new approximation method to  evaluate the modes of rapidly rotating fully relativistic  stellar models will be developed.  This approximation is  based on the fact that gravitational radiation couples only  weakly to the modes of primary physical interest in neutron  stars.  b) The program to evaluate the effects of superfluid  hydrodynamics on the gravitational radiation instability of  rotating neutron stars will be continued.  The next step is  to finish debugging the computer codes that evaluate the  modes of rapidly rotating superfluid neutron stars.  c) The  relationship between the dissipative relativistic fluid  theories of divergence type and the Lagrangian based  dissipative relativistic fluid theories will be  investigated.  It is hoped that the set of theories which  belong to both classes can be identified and that these will  contain a strong candidate to be THE theory of dissipative  relativistic fluids.  d) Further investigations into the  possibility of determining the nuclear equation of state by  measuring the masses and radii of neutron stars will be  carried out.",
