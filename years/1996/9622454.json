Loeb from   Frankfurt, Germany where he is a visitor for the month of March.      Abstract of Peter A. Loeb's project      The proposed research will continue Professor Peter Loeb's work   on representing measures and ideal boundaries in potential theory.   In particular, Loeb plans to continue research on a Martin-like boundary   which is regular almost everywhere with respect to harmonic measure.   An important tool in this research is the technique developed with   J. Bliedtner that reduces the production of Radon-Nikodym derivatives   as limits to a special case. This reduction casts new light on   the martingale convergence theorem and significantly simplifies   measure differentiation theorems as well as the treatment of   fine limit theorems in probability and potential theory.   A major consequence is the existence of simple boundary approach   neighborhood systems which, after fixing a suitable normalization,   are the \"best\" possible in terms of producing Radon-Nikodym derivatives   as limits at the boundary. The existence of such \"best\" systems had not   been known even for harmonic functions on the unit disk. Indeed,   previous results in the literature suggested that no such system   could exist. In related, ongoing research, Loeb has improved the   celebrated Besicovitch and Morse  covering theorems from geometric   measure theory by strengthening the results and simplifying the proofs,   including a demonstration that for any norm, the best constant   (in terms of all known proofs) for the Besicovitch result is a   packing constant. In all of his research, Professor Loeb will continue   to employ nonstandard models. These are mathematical structures with   infinitely large and infinitely small numbers. Even when the use of   such structures  is removed from the final proofs of results, they are   extremely helpful in the discovery process. Loeb has recently used   nonstandard models to optimize the coverings of Besicovitch's theorem,   and with Bliedtner he is now using these methods to extend the  notion   of radial limits to general potential theoretic settings.    The results of this research that have been obtained to date,   and the results that will be established in the proposed research   all lie at the heart of mathematical analysis and probability theory.   These are fundamental areas of mathematics used by scientists and   engineers to form the conceptual models of the phenomena with which they   work. The thought process itself can only be couched in terms of   mathematics, and the mathematics being used in turn yields new insight   into the phenomena being studied. Therefore, the simplification and   extension of the basic mathematical tools achieved by the proposed   research will resonate in all of the areas of science and engineering   that use these tools. Of particular importance for future developments   will be the successful employment of mathematical structures with   infinitely large and infinitely small numbers. These structures have   a great deal to offer in all areas of science and engineering because of   the simplicity and power inherent in their use. An important construction   associated with these structures are measure spaces, now called   \"Loeb spaces\" in the literature, which allow the treatment of infinite   probability phenomena using methods appropriate for finite sets.   Researchers including Loeb have obtained new results with these methods   in areas such as the study of partial differential equations,   probability theory, research in economics, and the study in physics   of laws governing the motion of gases.",
