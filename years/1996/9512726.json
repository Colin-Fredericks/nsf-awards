Dr. Hoekstra will work with Dr. Masanori Koyama, at  the Osaka National Research Institute on a research project  entitled, \"The Theoretical Study of Metal/Ceramic Interfaces  Using Ab Initio Calculation.\"    The purpose of the research is to study the properties  associated with the bonding of metal and ceramic interfaces.  Knowing the exact nature of the chemical bonds at the  metal/ceramic interface is extremely important in many of  today's highly technical industries, such as the  semiconductor and aerospace industries.  In this study, they  will use computer simulation to examine the chemical bonds  at the atomistic level to fully describe both the electronic  and ionic contributuions to the bonding.  With this  knowledge, current use of metal/ceramic materials can be  optimized, and possible new uses may be discovered.    The proposed research is of considerable theoretical and  practical interest to the materials science community and  the benefits to be obtained from collaborative research  valuable.  The Osaka National Research Institute is an  excellent research facility, and the research plan between  the host scientist and Dr. Hoekstra is well-conceived.  The  research will likely yield positive results for the United  States and Japan as well as the international scientific  community as a whole.  As such, the research satisfies the  objectives of the program in its emphasis on the exchange  and transfer of scientific knowledge through international  collaboration.  ***",
