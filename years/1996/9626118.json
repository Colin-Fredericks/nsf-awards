 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9626118   Brown      This research involves three statistical topics. i)  There are  several useful formulations involving nonparametric function  estimation including nonparmetric regression, nonparametric  density estimation and the standard nonparametric signal  processing model.  Recently the investigator and others have  proved the asymptotic equivalence of these models in settings  involving observation of one dimensional response variables.  The  investigators propose to construct a formulation for asymptotic  equivalence to enable obtaining effective equivalence results   for multidimensional response variables. ii) One standard method  for constructing statistical tests in certain complex parametric  situations involves conditioning on an ancillary statistic and  constructing a test within the (simpler) conditional problem at  the desired level of statistical significance.  Unfortunately  this procedure entails some peculiar statistical decision  theoretic consequences.  These are investigated more fully and  alternatives are proposed to this standard methodology which are  nearly as simple to implement but avoid these undesirable  consequences. iii) Standard tests for bioequivalence are  inherently one - dimensional in that they look at only one  performance aspect at a time.  This research constructs  multidimensional bioequivalence procedures based in part on  principles contained in recent research by the investigator and   collaborators.    Statistical procedures are often classified as single parameter,  multiparameter, or nonparametric depending whether the research  looks respectively at one performance characteristic, several  related ones, or an unstructured continuum of them, such as a  response function over time of unspecified shape. i) An important  component of the modem biotechnology enterprise involves testing   whether newly developed replicas of existing technologies have  the same effect as the original.  For example, does a (cheaper)  generic drug work exactly t he same as the original prescription  drug it is intended to replace.  Standard statistical tests of  \"bioequivalence\" have been formulated to test this hypothesis  based on data gathered about the two technologies.  These  standard tests are inherently one-dimensional, and can examine  only one performance facet at a time.  This research involves the  construction of general statistical tests of bioequivalence which  can simultaneously examine several related performance aspects.  ii) Nonparametric function estimation lies at another extreme in  statistical methodology.  Such techniques involve little prior  structure and few apriori assumptions.  They are thus extremely  valuable in a variety of modern scientific enterprises involving  analysis of masses of complex data including research on the  environment and on global change.  One technical problem  impacting this area has been the existence of several apparently   different mathematical formulations for such problems.  This  research involves the creation of a unified theory for such  problems which will enable more efficient research and more  effective use of these methods. iii) A third aspect of this  research involves the notion of asymptotically ancillary  statistics.  These are a technical device invented in part to  simplify the analysis of complex multiparameter models.  Modern  data collection and computing have vastly increased the  importance of analyzing such models, but more familiarity with  them reveals certain peculiarities and deficiencies which result  from using this technical device.  This research proposes  alternate technical advice which is nearly as simple to use but  avoids these peculiarities.",
