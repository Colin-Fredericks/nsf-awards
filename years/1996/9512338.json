 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support an upgrade of the existing  seawater system by constructing a filtration system which  will constitute a major advancement in the ability of  resident and visiting investigators to conduct important new  research at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory (BMFL).  With  the reconstruction of facilities destroyed by Hurricane Hugo  in 1989 now complete, the availability of laboratory space  and supporting equipment has resulted in increases in user  traffic and a strong spirit of a new beginning.  A diverse  program of research which ranges from landscape level  ecology to cellular biology is supported at the BMFL and new  faculty associates have identified new directions and  approaches to studying the structural and functional aspects  of estuarine systems.  Reconstruction of facilities included  a seawater delivery system, however, funds were not  sufficient to include any filtration.  Current research is  limited by high sediment and plankton loads in the existing,  unfiltered system.  Many studies conducted at the facility  require unfiltered raw water and the careful design of the  current system, partially funded by NSF, has provided  uninterrupted service for the past two years.  An equal or  greater number of studies could be carried out at the  facility if high quality filtered seawater were also  available.  The enhanced opportunities for graduate student  and visiting researchers would undoubtedly increase use of  the BMFL facility in the years ahead.  This project will  allow the purchase installation operation and maintenance of  a large volume, seawater filtration system at the new Baruch  Marine Field Laboratory.",
