 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are in the process of developing a state-of-the art free-air  carbon dioxide enrichment(FACE) facility in northern Wisconsin to  examine the interacting effects of elevated CO2 and O3 on a  Populus tremuloides forest ecosystem. The FACE system will allow  study of community level forest responses to elevated CO2 and O3  under natural, nonchambered conditions. We have assembled a  multidisciplinary team of scientists to examine responses from  the molecular to the ecosystem levels. Our long-term goal is to  examine the interacting effects of elevated CO2 and O3, alone and  in combination, on the productivity, competitive interactions,  and carbon and nitrogen fluxes in a regenerating aspen ecosystem.         Three replicate FACE rings will be established in each of  four treatments (CO2, O3, CO2 + O3 control) in a randomized  complete block design. Rooted cuttings from nine P. tremuloides  clones previously characterized for their O3 and/or CO2  sensitivities will be planted at 0.5 m x 0.5 m spacing across  each FACE ring. The close spacing will simulate a naturally  regenerating aspen forest. Fumigation with elevated CO2 (550 ppm)  and O3 (50 ppb above background during photosynthetically active  daylight hours to a target of 80 ppm-hr seasonal exposure) will  be conducted over the approximately 100-day growing season.  Growth measurements (height, diameter, biomass, leaf area, root  production and root mortality), physiological measurements  (photosynthesis, respiration, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll  content), plant nutrient status (nitrogen), foliar biochemistry  (carbohydrates, phenolic glycosides, and antioxidants), litter  decomposition rates, and soil respiration will be made throughout  each growing season.         The establishment and operation of this FACE system is an  expensive, capital-intensive research project. Therefore, we will  encourage multiple use of the research site by researchers and  their students. We currently have some 14 in vestigators and their  graduate students involved. Thus far, we have three years'  support from the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Forest  Service Northern Station's Global Change Program, the National  Council for Air and Stream Improvement of the Pulp and Paper  Industry, and Michigan Technological University. In addition, we  have significant in-kind contributions by the U.S. Forest Service  and Brookhaven National Laboratory. However, we are still short  of capital for critical air and meteorological monitoring  equipment, the related data acquisition systems, and ozone  generation.    This proposal seeks support for high resolution, rapid-response  instrumentation for the ozone, CO2, and meteorological  monitoring, and for the ozone generation needed for the facility.  We seek $251,671 from the National Science Foundation Academic  Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program; we have matching  contributions of $59,955 from the National Council for Air and  Stream Improvement of the Pulp and Paper Industry (NCASI) and  $44,896 from the host institution, Michigan Technological  University.",
