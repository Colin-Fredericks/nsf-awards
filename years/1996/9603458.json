 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603458  Holahan    The Center for Improved Engineering and Science Education (CIESE) at Stevens Institute of Technology is leading the New Jersey Networking Infrastructure in Education Project (NJNIE). NJNIE is an  NSF funded testbed project to reform K-12 science education. SIESE is in the second yar of this three-year, $219 million dollar program that is being implemented in collaboration with the New Jersey Statewide Systemic Initiative (NJSSI). CIESE's experience to date indicates that in some cases these technology transfer efforts have met with tremendous success, while in other cases little or no change has occurred despite equal access to resources, training, individualized assistance, etc.    A deeper understanding of the individual, organizational, and contextual factors associated with successful technology transfer will allow us to increase our effectiveness as change agents by designing interventions which are specific to the school or school district;s needs. Moreover, deeper understanding of the factors necessary for success will enable us to achieve a better return on investment by more wisely allocating scarce resources.    The first objective of this project is to develop a model of the individual, organizational and contextual factors that are important determinants of successful technology transfer. In this case successful technology transfer means successful integpation of telecommunications technology into the science curriculum and the use of the Internet in teaching K-12 science. The second goal of this project is to validate this model on a random sample of schools participating in the NJNIE project.    The model to be developed will investigate three clusters of categories of predictors:  (1)  characteristics of the school's administrators and teachers (individual level factors),   (2)  characteristics of the school itself (organizational factors), and  (3)  characteristics of the context in which the school operates (district level factors).    The literature suggests  that all three classes of variables play a role in successfully transferring new technology. However, there is little in the way of evidence to suggest (a)  which variables within each of these three classes of  variables are most important to successful transfer, and (b) which of the three classes of variables overall is most important. Therefore, a third goal of the project will be to determine the relative importance of the variables in explaining successful technology transfer. Understanding the relative immportance of the various predictor variables should allow us to design interventions and allocate resources in ways that will have the greatest impact on desired outcomes.",
