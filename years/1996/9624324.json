 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vast majority of serious software design flaws are due  to incomplete, inconsistent, or obscure requirements  documents. It is in the very first stages of software  development, the requirements specification phase, that the  fewest formal procedures exist to aid the analyst.  Techniques to capture, verify, and validate requirements  specifications for embedded systems are of demonstrable  importance. This project focuses on validation of  requirements specifications, specifically on executable  specifications.  An integrated framework is being  constructed for the development, analysis, and execution of  high-level requirements specifications for embedded systems.  The framework is intended to support (1) execution and  simulation of embedded system requirements (hardware-in- the  loop simulation), and (2) requirements reuse and  requirements synthesis based on the structure and design of  the physical system. This environment will enable an  executable high-level requirements specification to interact  with: (1) models of the assumed behavior of the environment,  (2) software simulations of the environment, or (3) the  actual physical components in the environment.  The approach  taken is to extend an existing formal specification  language, RSML, with the capability to define system-level  inter-component communication in an embedded system.    The educational component of this CAREER project seeks to  increase industrial involvement in undergraduate and  graduate education through case studies and industrial  projects.  A remotely-accessible embedded systems laboratory  is being established, where students can gain realistic  hands-on experience with software development for real-time  systems.  ***",
