 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630903  Shen      To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate embryonic pattern formation and differentiation, it is necessary to identify candidate growth factors that may be involved in these processes, and to characterize their functional properties.  Previous studies of mouse embryogenesis in this laboratory have used a differential display screening approach to identify mesoderm-specific genes expressed during the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells in culture.  This strategy has resulted in the isolation of a novel gene named Cryptic, which encodes a potentially secreted molecule containing a single copy of an epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) motif.  Analysis of Cryptic expression indicates that it is expressed during gastrulation in two distinct spatial domains, which correspond to the axial mesoderm and to the lateral plate mesoderm.  Thus, the novel gene Cryptic encodes a potential signaling molecule that has an expression pattern consistent with a role in mesoderm patterning and differentiation.  Notably, Cryptic appears to be a member of a new family of EGF-related growth factors.  The Cryptic gene was originally named on the basis of its significant sequence similarities with the Cripto gene, which is also expressed during mesoderm formation and has growth stimulating activities in cell culture.  The Cryptic gene is also related to a recently described Xenopus gene named FRL-1, which has mesoderm - and neural-inducing activities in embryonic assays, and can activate fibroblast growth factor IFGF) receptors.  Based on (1) the sequence similarities between Cryptic, Cripto, and FRL-1, (2) the growth factor activity of Cripto, (3) the mesoderm and neural-inducing activities of FRL-1, (4) the activation of FGF receptors by FRL-1, and (5) the spatially and temporally restricted pattern of Cryptic expression, it is likely that Cryptic encodes a potential signaling molecule that may be involved in cellular interactions during embryonic pattern formation and cell fate det ermination.  To address this hypothesis, the proposed research will investigate the biological and biochemical properties of Cryptic, organized around three specific aims: (1)  Characterization of Cryptic mRNA and protein expression patterns, (2)  Investigation of the biochemical properties and function of CRYPTIC protein and its receptor, and (3) Analysis of biological requirements for Cryptic during mouse development.  Taken together, these studies will synergize to provide a greater understanding of the biological and biochemical functions of this novel growth factor-like molecule, and perhaps those related family members.  Furthermore, these investigations may lead to insights concerning the molecular mechanisms involved in growth factor signaling during embryonic patterning and differentiation in vertebrate development.",
