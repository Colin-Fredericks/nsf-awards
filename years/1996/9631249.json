 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Elisabeth Bell-Loncella, Department of Chemistry, University of   Pittsburgh, Johnstown, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division under a Research   Planning Grant to study nitrogenase model systems.   The role of the   driving force of the redox-active metal and the number of acid-labile   protons on the non-innocent ligand are the focus of this proposal.   Planning activities involve the synthesis and characterization of a   series of oxime complexes coupled to bis(bipyridyl)ruthenium.  The goal   is to determine the conditions which facilitate proton-coupled electron   transfer over a range of oxidation states.  The project is intended to   lay the foundation for further study of the synergistic transfer of   protons and electrons, and will be included as preliminary data in   preparation of a Faculty Research Project Proposal to be submitted   through the NSF's Research at Undergraduate Institutions program.  Nitrogenase is an important enzyme in plants which allows for the   conversion of molecular nitrogen to ammonia, an essential plant nutrient.    The mechanism of this conversion involves the simultaneous transfer of   protons and electrons, and metals such as ruthenium play a key role in   facilitating these transfer processes. Ruthenium complexes will be   synthesized and studied as models for this fundamental biological   process, and the factors affecting the transfer processes will be   determined.",
