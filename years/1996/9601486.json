 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this proposal is to establish a core facility which  will provide the necessary instrumentation for state of the art study  of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. This facility  will support the research programs of faculty in the Department of  Biology of Emory College, and the Department of Microbiology and  Immunology of the School of Medicine of Emory University. These two  Departments are located on successive floors of the Rollins Research  Center, a modern building less than five years old. Faculty whose  research efforts form the basis of this proposal include R. Ahmed  (Micro.), J. Boss (Micro.), G. Churchward (Micro.), R. Compans  (Micro.), G. Crouse (Biol.), D. Falls (Biol.), H. Ellis (Biol.), A.  Glasgow (Micro.), S. L'Hernault (Biol.), G. Jones (Biol.), J. Lucchesi  (Biol.), S. Jinks-Robertson (Biol.), C. Moran (Micro.) and K Ziegler  (Micro.). There are already extensive interactions between these  faculty members because they are members of the interdepartmental  graduate programs in Genetics and Microbiology, and share common  research interests and teaching duties. The core facility will consist  of a Biacore 2000 biomolecular interaction analysis system, a Beckton  Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer and cell sorting system, 2  Molecular Dynamics Storm phosphorimagers with autoradiography and  fluorescent detection capabilities, an ABI Prism automated DNA  sequencer and a Pharmacia ALF Express automated DNA sequencer. This  equipment will allow this varied group of well funded investigators to  perform state of the art studies of macromolecular interactions that  occur in many fundamental biological processes. These processes include  DNA replication, recombination and repair, transcription and the  regulation of gene expression, the development of multicellular  organisms and the basic functioning of the immune system. The types of  interactions that are being studied include the interactions between  cell surface receptor proteins and their  ligands, protein-protein  interactions that occur in the assembly of complex protein machines  such as RNA polymerase holoenzymes, the interactions between these  protein machines and their regulatory proteins, and the binding of  recombination and repair enzymes, nucleic acid polymerases and  regulatory proteins with their nucleic acid substrates. The  investigators included in this proposal currently have $1,899,888 in  direct costs for the current year, of which $170,457 is from NSF. These  figures include only funding for basic research and do not include  funding for disease-oriented research. The goal of this application  matches NSF goals as follows. Some of the items of equipment proposed  in this application are not currently available on campus and will  allow the development of completely new experimental approaches. Access  to other existing items of equipment is becoming increasingly difficult  because of the expansion of research activities at Emory University.  The proposed facility will therefore improve accessibility to and  greater utilization of modem research instrumentation. All of the  investigators listed in this proposal train graduate and undergraduate  students. Together, they supervise in their laboratories 12  postdoctoral fellows, 31graduate students and 20 undergraduate students  and so the instrumentation will be used in the training of future  scientists. Matching funds (50%) for this proposal will be available.",
