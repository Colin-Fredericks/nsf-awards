 "awd_abstract_narration": "NMR Concepts is offering two workshops each summer for three years.   The workshops will improve the ability of undergraduate faculty to  teach NMR courses and to conduct research.  Each workshop will  consist of lectures, laboratory sessions, and problem solving  sessions.  There will also be keynote speakers and classroom  presentations by the participants.  The workshops end with round  table discussions to aid the participants in incorporating their  new knowledge into their courses and research efforts.  The first  workshop, NMR Concepts and Operating Techniques, presents the  physical concepts of NMR and includes spectrometer operation, the  Fourier transform, quadrature phase detection, data treatment,  relaxation measurements, and NOEs. The second workshop,  Intermediate and Advanced Interpretation of 1D and Basic  Interpretation of 2D NMR Spectra, reviews the general features of  proton and carbon spectra and then treats the use of relaxation  time measurements, proton decoupling procedures, NOE, and some  multinuclear NMR.  The keynote speakers will be selected from  academia with a focus on how they have integrated NMR into their  curriculum and how they use it in their research.  Participants  will be expected to share through a variety of means instructional  materials that they develop as a result of their participation in  the workshop.",
