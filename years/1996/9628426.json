 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628426  Hirshon     The AAAS is developing and testing a pilot phase of an on-line website science club for youth.  Kinetic City Cyberclub will engage youth in episodic adventures to promote both group and independent exploration.  Users will receive carefully crafted, paced challenges as they wind their way through a mystery or other related activity.  The adventures will be presented over time in a series of episodes that require users to use science toward solving an on-going mystery or problem.  Components of the on-line club will include:  Story Pods which set up the problem and inform users of what has been learned to date;  Clue Pods which include information and activities that users can add to their individual electronic notebooks;  Experiment Pods where users will be able to try out different theories to solve immediate problems; Discussion Pods where questions will be posed to which users are encourage to respond; and a Voting Pods where users get to vote on the next direction the science exploration should take or on possible solutions to problems.  Components of the web page will be updated on a regular basis with most of the content being changed weekly and, in some instances, daily.    The PI will be Robert Hirshon of the AAAS who has been the key developer of The Kinetic City Super Crew, the radio series on which the Kinetic City Cyberclub is based.  The Senior Producer responsible for developing and maintaining the website will be Kimberly Amaral.  Ms. Amaral previously been a writer/web developer for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Coastal Research Center and Sea Grant and she has worked as a researcher/writer for Bill Nye the Science Guy.  Dissemination and outreach will be a joint effort of the AAAS and the National Science Teachers Association.  Evaluation will be conducted by Arthur C. Johnson, an independent evaluator and instructor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.",
