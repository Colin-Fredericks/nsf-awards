 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the design, implementation, and evaluation  of flow cytometric instrumentation and operating procedures for use in  the cytoenzymological and histochemical analysis of eukaryotic cells.  It is divided into two subprojects. The first involves the development  of a second-generation digital data acquisition and pulse processing  system for the real-time analysis and sorting of cells based on pulse  shape features. The second subproject involves the development of novel  gene expression systems for use in the molecular and cellular analysis  in flow of transgenic eukaryotic cells. We then intend to employ these  techniques for the selection through flow sorting of transformed plant  nuclei according to the level of transgene expression, ultimately  directed at the construction of cDNA libraries representing the  developmentally-regulated genes of tissues that are  microscopically-small.       The significance of this work is as follows. In the first case, our  previous work has shown that important information about eukaryotic  cells is contained within the waveform shapes produced by these cells  produced when they are subjected to analysis using flow cytometry.  Present flow cytometric instrumentation cannot extract this shape-based  information. The capability of the proposed second generation machine  to analyze and sort cells based on pulse shape information will provide  important knowledge about cellular substructure. This will lead to  improved understanding of the basic cellular biology of living cells.  In the second case, the ability of scientists to analyze the expression  of genes within different cell types is hampered when these cells are  interspersed within other cell types. The molecular methods proposed in  this project should provide general means for isolation of transcripts  from any desired cell type. This should greatly facilitate advances in  the study of developmental- and cell type-specific gene expression.",
