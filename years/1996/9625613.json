 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three research projects in nonlinear optimization will be  undertaken; they range from theoretical studies of constrained  optimization algorithms to the development of a network-based  optimization system capable of solving problems automatically  over the Internet.    The first project is devoted to the design of limited memory  approaches for large-scale nonlinear programming.  Limited memory  methods have proved to be quite useful for solving many classes  of large unconstrained problems, but their economy and simplicity  have not been fully exploited in the nonlinearly constrained  case. The basic guiding principle in this work is to employ only  algorithms with modest computational requirements and to  represent limited memory matrices in compact form, so that the  overall cost of the iteration is only a fraction of that required  by the standard Sequential Quadratic Programming iteration.  The  new algorithms will allow the user to choose between direct and  iterative methods for solving the linear subproblems arising in  the iteration.    The second project is devoted to the design and analysis of  interior-point methods for nonlinearly constrained (non-convex)  optimization problems. This is a long term research effort that  first aims at identifying the crucial ingredients of the  algorithms, such as the choice of model, the function, and the  numerical techniques for solving the (ill-conditioned)  subproblems.  The new methods will be formulated in a trust  region framework, which allows a uniform treatment of the convex  and non-convex cases. The research will be guided by a  combination of numerical testing and convergence analysis.    An Internet-based optimization system called NEOS has recently  been developed by a group of investigators at Northwestern and  Argonne. One of the objectives of NEOS is to allow users to solve  optimization problems remotely and with minimal effort using  modern web browsers. The third project in this proposal  considers extending the capabilities of  NEOS so that it can  interact with modern modeling languages. A new constrained  optimization server will also be developed.  ***",
