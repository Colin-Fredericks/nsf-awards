Duncan's work will emphasize the precise dating of samples from the ridge using the Argon-40/Argon-39 technique in which his lab specializes; he will also analyze samples for rare earth elements.  The objective of Duncan's research is to test a model based primarily on samples rocks collected on land surrounding the Caribbean that much of the seafloor underlying the Caribbean was formed very rapidly about 88 million years ago by a large volcanic outpouring related to the Galapagos mantle plume.  In addition to the specific studies proposed here of samples to be collected by submersible, the project will assist in identifying precise sites for proposed deep ocean drilling by the Ocean Drilling Program, an international collaborative research effort led by NSF using the research drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution.  ***",
