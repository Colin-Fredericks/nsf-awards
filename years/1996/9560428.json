 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a mixed-mode Fully-Depleted Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (FD CMOS) technology suitable for scientific applications. This technology will offer higher speed performance at lower power dissipation and operate in more severe environments than the present bulk CMOS technology. The approach is to keep the process simple, utilize presently available processing equipment, avoid exotic materials and transistor configurations, relax the design rules, and provide the ultra-thin Silicon On Insulator (SOI) substrates, so that the technology can be introduced quickly to the community and be made available from a wide variety of sources.   This project will verify the computer simulations of the FD CMOS process and experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of processing FD channels in its ultra-thin Bond and Etchback SOI (BESOI) material by fabricating and evaluating MOS capacitors. The specific objectives are to adjust and validate the channel implant and anneal parameters used to set the n-channel transistor threshold voltage and to demonstrate that the ultra-thin SOI material made with our BESOI process is suitable for processing the FD MOS transistors. An additional Phase I objective will be to improve the quality and uniformity of the epitaxial films used for manufacturing the ultra-thin BESOI material.   The FD CMOS technology is being considered for next-generation commercial products which require high levels of integration and ultra-low power. The results of this program will be commercialized through specialized detector products, process licensing, and the manufacture of ultra-thin SOI substrates.",
