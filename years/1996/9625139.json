 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Jackson Public School District proposes to provide a program  which addresses the need to increase the number of minority  students enrolled in science and mathematics courses while  decreasing the disparity between the academic performance of  minority and majority students nationally.  The Comprehensive  Partnerships for Student Achievement (CPMSA) project will be a  collaborative partnership among the Jackson public School District,  Jackson State University, Tougaloo college, the Algebra Project,  and others.  Middle school students will be targeted initially, and  the project will insure full participation of all who come in  contact with the students, including principals, teachers,  counselors, and parents.  Plans and strategies include:  restructuring the science and mathematics curriculum to align it  with the national standards and eliminate general courses; moving  toward more hands-on, student-centered, discovery-based learning;  requiring content certification for teachers of science and  mathematics; providing enrichment experiences for students;  enhancing skills of teachers and counselors; and increasing  mathematics and science awareness and expectations of parents.    JPSD already has initiated curriculum and administrative  restructuring which emphasizes the need \"to improve the quality and  quantity of science and mathematics education received by minority  students, who are significantly underrepresented in science,  engineering, and mathematics (SEM) fields.\"  The District has  adopted these goals--Every JPSD student will be at or above grade  level; score at or above the national average on the ACT: and  graduate or pursue continuing education and/or military services.   The new administration also is promoting the significance of  \"expectation\" in student achievement.  All of those involved with  students are being advised to \"expect\" students to do well.   Administrators, teachers, and parents have embraced the proposed  reforms and are actively involved in developin g plans for change.   University support is evident, such as Jackson State University  with a history of forerunner programs designed to accomplish the  described goals.  The fact that the goals and activities of the  District are already in line with those of CPMSA will make systemic  reform an easier task.  All segments of the community, including  universities, businesses, churches, and community organizations are  agreeing to participate in this endeavor.  The goal of this project  is to increase the number of minority students enrolling in an  successfully completing precollege courses which will prepare them  to pursue undergraduate programs in the sciences, engineering, and  mathematics.  ***",
