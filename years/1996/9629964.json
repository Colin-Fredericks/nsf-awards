 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor John Pople is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the   application of molecular orbital theory to a range of chemically   important problems.  Molecular orbital theory, as applied by Professor   Pople has become an integral part of chemistry used not only by   theoreticians, but also by a wide range of experimental chemists.   His   methods have proved to be an invaluable complimentary tool to much of   experimental chemistry.    Pople plans to continue his algorithm development and research in the   following three areas:  1) Research will continue on the foundations of   density functional theory.  These include further investigations into   density functional theory, where the two-electron density will be   investigated. The aim  of this work is to find improved   exchange-correlation functionals.  2)The second area is concerned with   extensions of theoretical thermochemistry.  The aim here is to improve on   the current model used to predict energies of small systems.  Several   areas which form the basis of the model will be examined and improved.    3) The third involves the use of Object Oriented Classes in scientific   programming.  This is a continuation of work begun in the previous grant   period whose aim is to provide a more general implementation of   post-Hartree-Fock correlation theories.",
