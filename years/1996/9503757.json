 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503757  Hu  This project will investigate efficient parallel algorithms to  find all numerical solutions for large-scale nonlinear systems of  equations in a given domain with mathematical certainty, even in  the presence of uncertainty in the data, roundoff error, and  nonlinearities by finite digit computations.  The basic algorithm  to be used is based on the interval Newton/Generalized bisection  method.  Parallel algorithms will be implemented on vector  processors, shared-memory multiprocessors, and distributed-memory  multicomputers.  On a vector processor, new data structures will be designed to  take full advantage of completely pipelined functional units of  vector processors.  To speed memory accessing, techniques will be  developed to increase cache hit ratio on machines with cache such  as the IBM 3090, and to reduce bank conflict on interleaved  memory systems such as the CRAY C90.  On a shared memory  multiprocessor, optimal partitioning schemes will be studied for  given nonlinear systems based on two protocols.  By overlapping  communication and computation, in addition to reducing  communication and contention, large speedup is expected.  On  distributed-memory multicomputers, algorithms on coarse grained  SPMP schemes and fine-grained MPMP schemes will be implemented on  realistic machines.  General sparsity and scalability will be  considered in all implementations.  ***",
