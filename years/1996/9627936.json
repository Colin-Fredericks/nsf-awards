Baldwin, Principal Investigator    This award provides funding to the National Technological University for support of the 1996 National Engineers Week Teleconference for Middle and High School Students.  This seventh annual Discover Engineering teleconference will be delivered nationwide during National Engineers Week, on Feb. 21, 1996.  The purpose of this teleconference is two-fold.  First, the program provides U.S. middle and high school students and their teachers with an interesting insight into the work and career opportunities of engineers in a novel teleconference setting.  Secondly, the Discover Engineering telecast serves as the centerpiece of open houses at many industrial, government and college locations.  The telecast series is central to many local activities wherein engineers welcome students and teachers to the workplace, providing tours and wraparound discussion which are stimulated by the telecast.",
