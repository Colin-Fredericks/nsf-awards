The  conference is being   held in honor of Donald J. Newman, and the emphasis is on areas  of mathematics   that have been influenced by Newman's ideas. The conference will  create   opportunities for cross-fertilization of ideas among workers in  two important   areas of classical mathematics.    Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole  numbers,   addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility  of one   whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of  mathematics and   was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within   the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in  diverse   applications in areas such as data transmission and processing,  and   communication systems. Harmonic analysis combines those elements  of mathematics   best  exemplifying the ideas of synthesis.  One seeks to  decompose  complex   problems into fundamental components.  These components are then  analyzed for   their basic characteristics. Finally, the  solution is  reconstructed through a   recombination of the  components.The Fourier series and Fourier  transform are    examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the other   representing   a continuous decomposition. Harmonic analysis is a surprisingly  useful tool in  studying whole numbers.",
