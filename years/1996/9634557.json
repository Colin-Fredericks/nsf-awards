 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary focus of this research is to develop a new  mathematical model to explain and predict the nontraditional  vibration resonances observed in disk drive experiments.  This new mathematical model is agumented to resolve five  emerging vibration problems in the disk drive industry. They  include damping, forced response, disk/spindle/head  interaction, control of squealing noise, and nonlinear fluid-  film bearings. In the past several years, advances in  manufacturing and electronic technologies have substantially  increased the capacity of computer disk drives by enhancing  the data storage density(e.g., 4000 tracks per inch) and by  stacking more disks (e.g., 10 disks) into modern disk  drives. In the meantime, the computer industry continues to  reduce the size and weight of disk drives by using smaller  and thinner disks mounted on spindles with shorter bearing  spans. As a result of these design trends, vibration  resonances less than 500 Hz with significant amplitudes have  been observed repeatedly in experiments. These vibration  resonances are extremely detrimental to their performance,  because their low frequencies and large amplitudes prevent  the recording heads from reading or writing the data  correctly and repeatedly. This new mathematical model is  more realistic than the existing models, because it  considers multiple flexible disks on a rigid spindle that  has two flexible bearing supports. The theoretical  predictions are verified experimentally through a full-scale  disk drive test rig available in the Dynamics and Vibration  Laboratory at the University of Washington.",
