 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601625  Weller       The Vector Measuring  Current Meter  (VMCM) was  developed by Drs. Robert Weller and  Russ Davis and  commercially produced by EG&G Sealink System.  According to  the PIs, the science requirements for high quality vector  measurements in the near surface region near buoys continue  to increase and the VMCM propeller current meter is  recognized as the current standard.  The problem is that the  VMCM is no longer commercially available and the data  recorder and reader, originally manufactured by Sea Data  Corp, are  also no longer available or repairable. This  proposal seeks funding to redesign the vector measuring  circuitry, data acquisition and storage components so as to  provide a new, lighter, flexible, inexpensive and low power  instrument.  Replacement of aging tape recorders will  increase data return.  Reduction of size and weight will  permit the use of the VMCM on new mooring designs, such as  horizontal arrays.   The project will permit the over 40  EG&G Sea Link, Inc.  VMCMs that the Upper Ocean Processes  group uses, as well as those within the rest of the  oceanographic community to be used reliably into the next  decade.  WHOI's cost share of $159,000 represents 51% of the  total cost for this project.  ***",
