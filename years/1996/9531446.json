 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer Institute for the Mathematical Sciences at  Berkeley      The University of California at Berkeley proposes to develop and  operate the  Summer Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (SIMS), a 6-week  program for  mathematically talented undergraduate women. SIMS provides 24  women, selected  nationwide, with an intensive mathematics program that is  designed to motivate  and prepare them to enter and complete successfully a Ph.D.  program in the  mathematical sciences.    SIMS aims to provide participants with a mathematical experience  that will give  them a taste of what it is to be a researcher in the mathematical  sciences,  and it aims to communicate to the students that women can and  should be doing  mathematics. At the heart of the program are four seminars, two  each in pure and  applied mathematics. Each seminar is led by a woman, selected  nationwide, who is  an active research mathematician and a talented teacher. She is  aided by a  teaching assistant who is a female graduate student in  mathematics. The students  take two seminars, one pure and one applied. The character of the  work is very  different from that which is encountered in typical undergraduate  mathematics  courses. Students immerse themselves in the seminar material to  discover and  prove results without the aid of textbooks, they are given many  hard problems  and projects, and they learn how to obtain and express  mathematical ideas in  conversation and in writing. In addition to the seminars,  mathematics colloquia  are held twice weekly. In these talks, well-known mathematicians  introduce the  students to a vast panorama of mathematical topics. There are  also panel  discussions on: applying to graduate school and fellowship  sources, the variety  of graduate programs available in the mathematical sciences,  non-academic  careers in mathematics, and the challenges women face as graduate  students and  as professionals in the mathematical sciences.",
