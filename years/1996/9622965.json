 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Keen    The  proposed research is in three different areas: first, hyperbolic density in special families of meromorphic functions; second, the definition of moduli for quasi-conformal deformation spaces of Kleinian groups; and third, discreteness in a one parameter family of   2-generator Kleinian groups.   i - One of the outstanding problems in conformal dynamical systems is to  prove that, for a given family, the hyperbolic systems are dense.  We    propose to extend our result that the functions in the family {f(z,c) = c  tan(z)} are dense to other finite dimensional families of meromorphic  functions; in particular, to families with no critical points and  finitely many asymptotic values.  ii - We shall extend our definition of Pleating Coordinates from one and  two dimensional spaces of Kleinian groups to arbitrary spaces of Kleinian  groups.  The advantage of pleating coordinates is that they give a direct  relation between the geometry of the  hyperbolic 3-manifold determined by  the group and complex analytic trace moduli for the group.   iii - We consider a family of two generator subgroups of PSL(2,C) with  one fixed parabolic generator and one parabolic generator depending on a  single complex parameter c.  We propose to extend the kind of analysis we  have used in our work on pleating coordinates to find necessary and  sufficient conditions on c for the groups to be discrete.     Research is proposed in three different areas.  The first involves extending previous work in the area of conformal dynamical systems. Such systems arise as models of various physical, economic and social phenomena.  A dynamical system may be described by a family of functions, f(z,c), depending on two variables. For each fixed value of c we are   interested in the orbits of a given point z; that is, we consider the set of points z, f(c,z), f(f(c,z)), and so on.  If a small change in the input data, z, changes the orbit only slightly, we say the system is stable, or predictable.  If a small change  in z, on the other hand, causes a drastic change in the orbit, we say the system is chaotic.  If the orbits satisfy   a certain technical condition, the system is called hyperbolic.  It would seem that hyperbolic behavior is the norm, but this is often difficult to prove.  We have proved that it is for a special class of functions and propose to extend this work to a larger class.  The second area of research involves studying a class of 3 dimensional objects called hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  They are so-called because they are endowed with a non-Euclidean geometry called a hyperbolic geometry. In such a geometry the sum of the angles in a triangle is less than a straight angle.  The hyperbolic 3-manifold may be varied so that the geometry changes, but remains hyperbolic.  In previous work, based on  careful analysis of examples generated by sophisticated computer programs, we found a good way to describe one and two parameter families of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  We propose to extend this work to families depending on a arbitrary number of parameters.   In the course of our work on 3-manifolds we encountered a class of algebraic objects called groups.  These groups arise in a number of different areas of mathematics and have been studied by many researchers. There are, however, still a number of open questions concerning them and for our third area of research we propose to extend our previous analysis of these groups to answer some of these questions.",
