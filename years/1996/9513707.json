 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two-photon circular dichroism (TPCD), the differential absorption of  two left circularly polarized photons vs. two right circularly  polarized photons, was first discussed theoretically by Tinoco (1975)  and by Power (1975). This technique, which is theoretically similar to  Raman optical activity, has not yet been demonstrated experimentally  although the related TP-ORD effect has been demonstrated (Gedanken &  Tamir, 1987). We propose to construct a TPCD spectrometer based on  recently developed commercially available Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser  technology using the very sensitive transient thermal grating detection  method. Our primary area of interest is the secondary structure of  proteins. Given the lack of fluorescence of such proteins, this  application dictates a direct absorption or thermally based methodology  for detection of the TPCD signal. TPCD offers several potential  advantages as a method complimentary to conventional circular dichroism  (CD) for the determination of protein secondary structure and detection  of subtle conformational changes. These are (1 ) a new, linearly  independent data set is provided potentially permitting a unique  determination of secondary structure, (2) the TPCD spectrum extending  from 300 to 600 nm covers electronic excited states corresponding in  one-photon energy to 150 to 300 nm thus extending the range of the  excitations to higher energy and covering the expected higher exciton  components of the a-helix, (3) there are three independent TPCD spectra  (for two-photons of the same frequency and randomly oriented samples)  proving independent information. The spectrometer to be constructed is  based on high-repetition rate (1 kHz) femtosecond laser technology. The  detection of the two-photon CD signal will be based on the differential  transient thermal grating method. This method has been recently shown  to provide a very sensitive method for CD measurements and has  previously been shown to be a very sensitive method for performing  two-p hoton absorption measurements. Our proposal is to combine these  two capabilities to provide new two-photon CD information. A detailed  signal to noise calculation based on prior two-photon measurements  using this grating method and a reliable estimate of the expected  differential two-photon cross section shows that excellent signal to  noise will be achieved.",
