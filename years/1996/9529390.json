 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, carried out by Professor Phillipe  Guyot-Sionnest and his research group at the University of Chicago,  addresses questions of vibrational energy flow between adsorbed  molecules and metal surfaces.  Supported by the Analytical and  Surface Chemistry Program, this project examines the transfer of  vibrational energy between adsorbed diatomic molecules and the  metal surface, as well as the effect of vibrational excitation on  the dynamics of small molecule reactions at these surfaces.  The  development of fast infrared laser sources needed for these studies  forms another focus of this research effort.  The basic information  obtained from these studies is useful for our developing  understanding of important heterogeneous processes such as  catalysis and semiconductor device processing.   The detailed understanding of the dynamics of energy exchange and  reaction at solid surfaces is the goal of this research project.   Fast infrared laser probing of these processes is used to obtain a  detailed picture of energy transfer and reaction at metal surfaces.   This basic information impacts technologically important areas such  as heterogeneous catalysis and electronic materials processing.",
