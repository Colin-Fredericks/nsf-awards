 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624949  Gavin  The primary goal of this career research program is to  develop a control system for seismic structural vibration  suppression which is simple to implement, robust to  uncertainties in the structural model, requires very little  external power, and has guaranteed closed loop stability.  Structural members with adjustable stiffness and damping  will be installed in a lumped parameter structural system to  achieve this goal.  These members will make use of  electrorheological (ER) and magnetorheological (MR)  materials.  These materials behave like Newtonian fluids in  the absence of external electrostatic or magnetic fields but  quickly become visco-electic plastic solids when strong  fields are applied.  A model for the controllable structural  members will include a detailed model for ER and MR behavior  at low shear rates.  Experiments on ER and MR devices will  be used to refine the analytical models.  Models of a  structure with interacting ER or MR devices will be used to  derive control rules to suppress vibrations in these  nonlinear systems.  The performance of the control will be  judged by the attenuation of deformations and absolute  accelerations.  Control synthesis will be carried out by  using various control methods.  The companion educational  program is designed to capture the interest of young  students to give them the opportunity to indulge their  academic curiosities and to prepare graduate students for a  productive career in structural control.  A lecture and  portable hands-on demonstration will be prepared to be  delivered at area high schools and elementary schools.  Powerful problem solving tools will be given to  undergraduates computer packages.  Undergraduates will have  opportunities to conduct research of their own choosing or  as part of this research program.  Facilities will be in  place to provide laboratory support to their projects.  Graduate students will profit from a cummiculum in control  that is coordinated across all engineering departm ents at  Duke University.  Local industries will be involved in both  the research and education programs through collaborations  and summer internships.  This is a FY 96 Career award.  ***",
