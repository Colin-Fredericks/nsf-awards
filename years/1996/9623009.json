 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9623009  Adrian Ocneanu  Pennsylvania State University      The project \"Operator Algebras and Applications\" is concerned  with the study and classification of connections (commuting squares)  and subfactors. The main problem to be studied is the question of existence  of irreducible hyperfinite subfactors of arbitrary Jones index   larger than 4. Our previously developed techniques give   a reformulation of problem in terms of representations of an explicitly  described algebra, resulting in an easy construction of   nonhyperfinite irreducible subfactors associated to arbitrary graphs,   as well as the full classification of  all commuting squares with one of the indices less than or equal to 4,  natural constructions of all subfactors of index less than 4 and   a classification of all the intermediate subfactors in their Jones towers.  Unlike previous methods, the proofs are very conceptual,   use topological quantum field theory methods developed by us previously   and involve little computation. The problems can be reformulated in terms of  statistical mechanics and topological quantum field theory, and thus would  impact on these areas as well.     The project \"Operator Algebras and Applications\" is concerned with the   development of mathematical techniques for operator algebras and   quantum field theory. The quest for the unification of quantum mechanics   and gravity, which is fundamental to an understanding of the physical world,   appears to require a substantial amount of new mathematics. Our previous work  constructed among others the mathematics of a dictionary between operator  algebras (which are connected to quantum mechanics) and topology (which  studies the shape of space, and is important in the study of gravity).  The project involves further developments of these structures, together   with the study of their symmetries, which are important since physical laws   are naturally expressed as symmetries. The techniques proposed have  applications in statistical mechanical m odels, involved in   the study of the structure of materials as well as in the mathematics  of knot theory, which has found use in the study of complex  molecules such as DNA. The Japanese Ministry of Education  has designated the research area operator algebras and quantum field theory  one of the top 3 strategic research domains.",
