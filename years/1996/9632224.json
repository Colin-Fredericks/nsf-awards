 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lyne  AST 96-32224    This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports  the theoretical investigation of the break-up of meteoroids  upon entry into the terrestrial atmosphere.  The work will  improve on several of the simplifying assumptions made in  the past in atmospheric entry physics, such as material  ablation and  the associated energy transfers; the effects of shock layer  shapes, densities, and pressures; the problems that arise  from hyper velocities (i.e., velocities in excess of about  10 km/sec); and the problem of  mechanical bolide fragmentation.    The Principal Investigator has unique practical  qualifications for this research.  He has been a test  engineer at the hypersonic wind tunnels of the Air Force's  Arnold Engineering Development Center (1984-85) and he has  worked on atmospheric entry of manned spacecraft on Earth  and Mars at NASA's  Ames Research Center (1992).  For the past two years, he has  redirected his practical experience to the theoretical and  computational investigations of terrestrial meteor entries.",
