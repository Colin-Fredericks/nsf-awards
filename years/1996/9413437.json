 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hallett/Abstract         A laboratory study of ice crystals will include their  radiative properties, especially thermal infra-red (2-18 m)  extinction and emissivity.  This will include crystals oriented by  local electric fields.  Sufficient extinction for measurement will  be obtained by multiple path traverses.  The emissivity will be  obtained by comparison with backgrounds above and below cloud  temperature.  Optical depth measurements are to be performed at 685  nm to provide a convenient measure of integrated cloud projected  area for normalizing infrared extinction and absorption optical  depth measurements.  The extinction measurements will consider  clouds with narrower size and habit spectra than previously  produced, utilizing the principle of the La Mer generator  (controlled nucleation followed by controlled growth) at a specific  temperature.  The liquid drop nucleation mode will control the  crystallinity (number of crystals per nucleus), which will be  related to CCN properties (size, composition).         Complementary to this study, an investigation will be made of  the role of trace impurity defects role in leading to ice crystal  habit changes at cirrus temperatures.  Experiments will be carried  out in an existing diffusion chamber and will be used to refine the  protocol for crystal production in the nucleation study.  This will  give rise to specific crystal shapes associated with crystals  growing at different temperature (thin plate, pristine column,  hollow columns, equiaxed crystals and impurity (HNO3).  These  studies will be compared with the atmosphere through data already  taken in high level flights in several projects (TOGA-COARE,  EUCREX, FIRE II WISP) where crystals have been collected under  known conditions.  These will be related to their nucleation  characterization (particle volatility and thermal fractionation) CN  and physical size vs. critical supersaturation and thence to  crystal concentration and morphology.  The sensitivity of the  laboratory prod uced ice cloud extinction and emission will be  related to crystal habit and size and used as benchmarks for  development of a numerical/analytical model.  The ideas from these  different approaches will be synthesized in understanding cirrus  formation and its likely radiative properties.         Tropical cirrus originates in deep convection with associated  electrical activity.  The origin of such ice and electrical  activity (as a surrogate for ice production aloft and lower level  surface precipitation) will be investigated from data already  obtained on the NOAA P3 in CAPE, several hurricanes and tropical  convection.  This will relate ice evolution mechanisms to  coalescence processes at lower cloud levels, the rapidity of  secondary ice production in the transition region and ultimately  the likely flux of ice water substance into the anvil to give  differing radiative properties aloft.",
