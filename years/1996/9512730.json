This proposal requests funds  to support a Ph.D. graduate student for one month at the Fu  Jen University in Taiwan to work with Professor Ivan Lin,  and for the P.I.'s travel to Taiwan.  The investigators  propose to use in situ infrared spectroscopic techniques to  analyze reaction mechanisms of carbonylation. This is an  important project for developing the highly active and  selective catalysts for carbonylation of nitrocompounds.  The chemical industry considers the carbonylation reaction  the most promising environmentally benign process to replace  the conventional method of isocynate synthesis from the  reaction of phosgene.  The development of environmentally  benign chemical processes has been a priority area in the  NSF.  Furthermore, this project also provides opportunities  for a U.S. graduate student to have international research  experience at a university in Taiwan .",
