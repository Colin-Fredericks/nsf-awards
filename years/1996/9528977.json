 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the   Chemistry Division, Coe will study aqueous cluster ions using a novel   merged cation-anion fast beam apparatus.  Water and aqueous solvation   will be examined through the reaction of mass-selected beams of   oppositely charged cluster ions.  Recombination rate constants are   measured as a function of cluster size and center-of-mass collision   energy to reveal the effect of clustering solvent molecules.  Several new   experiments are proposed in order to examine larger cluster size and   determine the effect of solvent number.  Reactions of charged species in solution lie at the heart of many   chemical reactions, but very little hard information has been available   about the detailed role of the solvent in influencing the course of a   chemical reaction.  Prof. Coe will address this question by studying   molecular-scale species known as clusters, which consist of solvent   molecules attached to a central species which has an electrical charge.    Using a unique experimental apparatus he can determine, for example, how   many solvent molecules there must be around the central species in order   to keep positively charged materials from reacting immediately with   negatively charged species.  This will help to answer the more general   question of how many  molecules are needed to define what chemists mean   by a solution of one substance in another.",
