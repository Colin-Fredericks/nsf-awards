 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray crystallography and solution nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy of biological macromolecules have become important tools  for understanding biological phenomena at the atomic level. The number  of structures solved continues to increase rapidly due to advances in  techniques such as molecular cloning, crystallization screening, data  collection, and data analysis. Despite these successes, fundamental  questions remain about the solution of difficult structures and about  the adequate description of thermal motion and solvation of  macromolecules. After data acquisition and reduction, a large variety  of computational procedures are required to solve and refine a crystal  or solution NMR structure. In the previous grant period we have  extended the X-PLOR program by incorporating most aspects of phasing  and phase improvement in X-ray crystallography. New refinement  techniques were developed for both crystal and solution structures.  Some of these developments were implemented by design of a high-level  computer language. This high-level language allows one to easily modify  existing algorithms and to even design new ones without an intervening  programming step.    It is proposed to pursue the following specific aims: 1. Continue the  software development in order to make X-PLOR a nearly complete package  for structure determination. My laboratory has recently undertaken  several experimental crystallographic projects. This involvement in  structure solution will enable us to test and to further develop X-PLOR  by application to real problems. 2. Collect highly accurate phases for  selected cases obtained by multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction and  develop improved models of solvation and conformational variability. 3.  Develop protocols for crystallographic refinements at low to medium  resolution using all available experimental information in a  reduced-variable conformational space. 4. Continue development of  molecular replacement methods in the case of flexible molecules. 5 .  Develop improved methods for heavy atom searches for multiple  isomorphous replacement and multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction. 6.  Develop improved protocols for structure determination of RNA molecules  by solution NMR.",
