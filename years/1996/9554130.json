 "awd_abstract_narration": "9554130  Herr    This three year project, sponsored by Catlin Gable School of  Portland, Oregon, will prepare high school teachers of physics to  use teaching techniques based upon the latest developed  instrumentation and to apply this knowledge in their high school  physics classes.  Twenty teachers will attend three-week workshops  at three sites: Portland, Oregon; Omaha, Nebraska; and Palo Alto,  California, for a total of 60 teachers enhanced each year.    The program will teach the teachers physics content as well as  pedagogy based upon the latest research on student misconceptions.   When the project is over, the teachers will be able to use   instrumental techniques to clarify key physics concepts.  They will  be taught how to build some of their own equipment from components  easily found at local electronics and hardware stores and develop  laboratory modules based upon these instruments.  In total each  participant will have about 100 instrument based experiments which  can be used in the classroom.  Each module developed by the  participants is evaluated by a well know physics educator.  When  these teachers return to their schools, they will be provided  access to the internet and thus will be given support and  information from other teachers using these techniques.  Each  participant is required to carry out two workshops for other  physics teachers within a year after leaving the project.    Matching funds constitute about 30% of the NSF award.",
