 "awd_abstract_narration": "The El Verde Field Station, Puerto Rico, is a long-established research  facility in the only Neotropical rain forest under the jurisdiction of  the United States. The field station is located in the Caribbean  National Forest, which is an Experimental Forest, a Biosphere Reserve,  a participating component of the University of Puerto Rico Minority  Research Center of Excellence, and the site of the Luquillo Long-Term  Ecological Research Program. For over 30 years, the field station and  adjoining research area have been the focus of projects by scientists  from more than 50 institutions in the United States and other  countries. Current research projects are funded by the National Science  Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the  USDA Forest Service.    Research and living facilities at the El Verde Field Station date to  the 1930s and their current size restricts ongoing research activities.  Living space for researchers consists of four dormitory rooms with 28  beds with little space available for personal effects. A single  self-service kitchen serves all visitors. Communication from the field  station is limited to a radio connection with San Juan, a cellular  phone, and a telephone line located three kilometers from the field  station. There is no capability for data transfer or Internet  connection.    previous NSF grant supported development of,a master plan for  improvements to El Verde Field Station. This project will enact the  first of four phases describe in the El Verde Field Station Master  Plan. The project will provide the construction visitor's cabin and  provide a modern voice and electronic communications system. Matching  funds provided by the University of Puerto Rico will be used to  construct additional kitchen and dining facilities for visitors and  improve the physical plant of the station.",
