 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632651  Yablonovitch  The analogy between electromagnetic wave propagation in multi-dimensional  periodic structures, and electron wave propagation in real crystals, has  proven to be a very fruitful one.  Initial efforts were motivated by the  prospect, of a \"photonic bandgap\"; a frequency band in 3-dimensional  dielectric structures, in which electromagnetic waves are forbidden,  irrespective of propagation direction in space. These 3-dimensionally  periodic dielectric structures are frequently called \"photonic crystals\".  These can be useful in opto-electronics as electromagnetic micro-cavities  for so-called \"zero-threshold lasers\" and single-mode light emitting  diodes. Such structures would exhibit inhibited spontaneous emission, which  could lower the power requirements and increase reliability, particularly  of optical arrays. Alternately, such structures can show enhanced  spontaneous emission which would allow faster modulation speeds for optical  interconnects.    More and more often, manufacturing consists of making small things. Much of  today's technology is the consequence of 2-dimensional patterning on a  microscopic scale. In this proposal, the emphasis is on the technology for  making valuable 3 dimensional nanostructures, namely photonic crystals.    Three dimensional nano-fabrication is an extraordinarily challenging  undertaking. This project began in September of 1993. After an intense  initial period of equipment acquisition, installation, and testing, of;  electron beam writers, optical diagnostic probes, chemically assisted ion  beam etchers, and other thin film processing apparatus, the first photonic  crystals were made in early 1995. At this point in the project, the initial  optical evidence for a 3-dimensional photonic bandgap at optical  wavelengths has been detected. The appropriate Figure-of-Merit is the  reflectivity within the 3-d forbidden gap. The observed shape of the  optical transmission spectrum of the photonic crystal is close to  expectations, but thus  far the best midgap experimental reflectivity is  only ~80%. While this is already sufficient to begin monitoring the effect  of the photonic bandgap on spontaneous light emission devices, further  improvements will definitely be needed.    Improved reflectivity within the photonic bandgap will demand a higher  degree of structural precision in the nanostructure. If funded, the work  program would include the following: (a) Multiple ion beam etching, in  which 3 ion beam directions fire simultaneously, as opposed to the current  system of sequential etching steps, from a single ion beam, interrupted by  multiple sample rotations. (b) Optical feedback control of the hole  diameters during the chemically assisted ion beam etching. (c) 3-d ion beam  mask structures will be built and used. (d) If needed, the 3-d thickness of  the photon crystal will be built up by stacking nano-structure layers which  are separated by epitaxial liftoff, aligned by surface tension techniques,  and then rebonded by wafer fusion procedures. (e) 3-d nano-machining  technology will be extended to InP, whose electron/hole surface  recombination properties are favorable enough to allow the creation of  tiny, electrically pumped, light emitting devices.    This renewal proposal is being submitted in parallel with a substantially  identical one by our collaborator Prof. Axel Scherer of Caltech. Funding  would allow continuation of the joint UCLA/Caltech effort to develop the  technology for making 3-dimensional photonic crystal structures at the  scale of optical wavelengths, and to improve the structural precision and  midgap reflectivity of these structures. Such refined photonic crystal  structures should lend themselves to opto-electronic technology, and they  might be generically useful in optical science.      REVISED WORK STATEMENT    The overall scope of this NSF proposal will not change, but the amount  requested will be diminished to $60K/year respectively (from an original  request for $110K/yr.), to allow for th ose functions which will be  supported by the Army Research Office through an anticipated MURI contract.  The ARO and NSF efforts will divide along the following lines:    Extensive equipment development and construction necessary for our  ambitious program will be supported through the Army MURI, whereas most of  the training of both graduate and undergraduate students to build, use and  maintain this equipment will be primarily funded through this NSF grant at  UCLA.    The complex process which is necessary for defining and evaluating 3-d  photonic crystals will provide our students working on this project with an  excellent opportunity to become well acquainted with using and maintaining  a wide repertoire of advanced fabrication equipment. We propose that much  of the process development and optimization as well as student training  which will lead to the definition of advanced 3-d photonic crystals will be  done under the NSF proposal.    On the other hand, the device fabrication and construction of the equipment  necessary for this effort will be supported by the Army MURI. Excluded from  the NSF project will be more near term mission oriented projects, such as  microwave photonic crystals, the inclusion of 2-dimensional photonic  crystals as end-mirrors on edge-emitting laser diodes, the definition of  deep gratings used to form birefringent computer generated holograms, and  the development of high-contrast polarizing beam-splitters (with measured TE/TM contrast ratios in excess of 300:1).    Thus, the specific tasks performed for the NSF supported program will be:    1. The design of a multiple ion beam etching system with three ion sources,  2. The development of new three-dimensional masking procedures to make       thicker photonic crystals.  3. The development of mechanical stacking procedures using epitaxial       liftoff for thick photonic crystal fabrication.  4. The design and modeling of new optoelectronic devices based on photonic       crystals.  5. The development of altern ative lithography techniques over large areas,       such as through electrochemical self-assembly.    All of these tasks will be performed with the help of graduate and  undergraduate students, who will be trained in microfabrication  conventions, optical measurement techniques, and numerical modeling of  optical phenomena in photonic crystals. Graduate students will be directly  supported by the grant, whereas undergraduates will be exposed to this  state of the art equipment through summer programs and senior thesis and  workstudy experience in the laboratory.  ***",
