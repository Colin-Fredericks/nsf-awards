 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630054  Taylor    The  microbial  oxidation  of geothermally  produced  sulfur  compounds, principally hydrogen sulfide, is the energy  base  for supporting dense animal communities surrounding deep-sea  hydrothermal vents.  To  broaden our understanding  of  this  process  in  warm  water vents laboratory  enrichments  were  established  where seawater in contact with  coastal  marine  sediments  were  exposed to hydrogen sulfide  in  continuous  flow  reactors.  A self sustaining white flocculant material  became  established that was found to be comprised of  solid  sulfur  filaments  that were 0.5-2.0  micrometers  wide  and  ranged  between  20-500 micrometers in length.   Preliminary  studies  have  shown  that the filaments  are  produced  via  direct  excretion  by a motile bacterium and  the  filaments  produced   become  a  site  for  attachment  and   continued  excretion by other members of the population.  An intriguing  observation  in  our laboratory indicates  that  filamentous  sulfur  may be an abundant product of free-living  microbial  sulfide  oxidation  in  subseafloor regions  of  warm  water  hydrothermal  vents.  Recent descriptions  of  an  extensive  discharge  from so-called called \"blizzard\" or  \"snowblower\"  vents  on  the East Pacific Rise indicated large amounts  of  white flocculant material was released and accumulated  into  mats of 5 cm thickness.  We have examined this material  and  found   it  to  be  microscopically  and  chemically  nearly  identical to the filamentous sulfur material produced in our  laboratory reactors.    The  overall  goal  of this project will  be  to  study  the  microbial  ecology of filamentous sulfur formation,  and  to  apply  this  information to a greater understanding  of  the  microbial  processes  occurring in warm  water  hydrothermal  vents  and other sulfidic open flow environments.   We  will  focus  on  three  interdependent  areas  of  research:   (A)  Characterization  of  the  process  and  physiology  of  the  sul fide   oxidizing   organism  directly   responsible   for  filamentous  sulfur formation, and study of the interactions  between  these  organisms and the filamentous  product  that  presumably   allow  their  existence  in  high  fluid   flow  environments.  (B)  Determine the taxonomic and phylogenetic  characteristics   of  coastal  filamentous  sulfur-producing  organisms.    (C)    Determination  of   the   morphological  mechanism of filamentous sulfur formation.  The oxidation of  hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur of filamentous form  is  a  unique and undescribed phenomenon, and suggests  a  novel  solution to a microbial existence in turbulent environments.  Proposed studies, we believe, will provide the beginnings of  an  interesting  new  chapter in our  understanding  of  the  microbiology of the marine sulfur cycle, and will  introduce  a  novel  form  of  sulfur that may have  future  industrial  application.",
