 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brown/Abstract           The broad objective of the proposed research is to develop  improved models of the rainfall process and to seek appropriate  field data in order to reconcile theory and observation.  The work  will entail improved model formulation of raindrop coalescence and  breakup for detailed study of the rain process and for application  in models of cloud systems.  The research will focus on prediction  of the raindrop size distribution that describes the number and  sizes of drops within a unit volume of air.  The form of the drop  size distribution is of both theoretical and practical importance,  as it affects the dynamics and thermodynamics of the storm and  determines the rate at which the rain removes pollutants from the  atmosphere.         Specific objectives of the research are: to determine the  range of uncertainty in the current model formulation of drop  breakup and to identify specific needs for data acquisition and  qpecific problems in data representation;  to improve an existing  model of rainfall in a vertical shaft by incorporating a model of  cloud-water to rain-water conversion at the upper boundary and to  compare the model solutions with observed drop size distributions;   to develop a parameterization of the raindrop size distribution  within  the shaft for use in models of cloud systems;  to  investigate the common but unexplained phenomenon of oscillation in  rainfall intensity;  and to develop an entirely new model that  details the collision of two raindrops.  The active prospect of  obtaining new field measurements, using various radars, will be  pursued.",
