 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will be constructing a CD-ROM entitled A Multimedia  Companion to Developmental Biology.  This CD-ROM is  planned  to include those things that cannot be contained in a  textbook: moving images of animal development (along  with  animations, voice-overs, and labeled photographs to assist  the learner), research papers that enable each learner  access to primary literature, interactive animations that  enable one to understand complex experimental protocols,  interactive programs that enable one to model development by  changing the parameters of cell adhesion, migration,  etc.,  interviews with researchers whose work helped frame the  discipline, papers in the history of embryology, and  position papers debating issues of ethical concern to  contemporary developmental biologists (sex selection, gene  therapy, etc.) These presentations will be connected to one  another through three hierarchical indices and through  hypertext.  We plan to create different levels of  complexity, from entry level (middle-school) through  graduate levels,  in several areas.  While less advanced  students can gain much from watching the videos and  animations, more  advanced students can now plan their own  paths through the various presentations.  We hope to develop  Version 1.0  of this project over the sabbatical leave of  the Principal Investigator and to sell the resulting disc  \"at cost.\" It will be  multiplatform and could be used with  any textbook in developmental biology or embryology (not  necessarily the one  authored by the P.I.) Version 1.0 would  contain sections on fertilization, embryonic cleavage,  gastrulation, cell  specification, induction, developmental  neurobiology, sex determination, metamorphosis,  gametogenesis, and  differential gene expression.",
