 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-61408  Garshnek     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a simple, portable and efficient water desalination device that takes full advantage of abundant natural resources of cold deep ocean water, solar energy, and the unique aspect of utilizing the dynamics of generated secondary vortices of the type commonly encountered when stirring a cup of tea or, on a larger scale, within a hurricane. In nature, a hurricane is actually a \"solar still\" whose efficiency is greatly enhanced by secondary vortices which rapidly transport moisture-laden air to the cooler upper atmosphere where it precipitates as rain. The proposed device is a smaller version of a contained hurricane whose efficiency is increased by rotor-generated vortices. Phase I research will focus on the fabrication of a half-scale Hurricane Tower desalination plant pilot system, generation of a secondary vortex in a closed system, and engineering/feasibility tests of the system distillation efficiency utilizing deep ocean water (4-6 C) as the coolant to condense rapidly rising vapor and solar-heated ocean salt water (for desalination). Phase II will develop an operational full-scale demonstration unit that could lead to the commercial development of a low-cost, low energy, desalination plant capable of operating on floating barges, in fixed locations, or mobile platforms to service geographic areas where water desalination is needed and where deep ocean water is available.   Commercial applications of the Hurricane Tower device include desalination plants for military applications, oil rigs, coastal regions, and island and inter-island water supply; emergency water supply during disasters, water contamination, or drought; and reliable water supply for atolls, island states, and Third World nations. Hurricane Tower water desalination systems could also replace aged and expensive fixed water desalination plants in use today_providing an economical source of fresh water supply for everyday use or emergen cies situations.",
