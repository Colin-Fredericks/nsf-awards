 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary relationships among species of New World monkeys are poorly known.  Several  different hypotheses of relationships have been generated with morphological characters and  nuclear DNA sequences.  Three major groups o f New World monkeys-callithrichids (tamarins  and marmosets), pithecines (sakis and uakaris), and atelines (spider, woolly, and woolly-spider  monkeys), are well supported in all of these studies.  However, most of all other relationships  show weak support  and differ across studies, suggesting that a fast sequence of speciation  events (or evolutionary radiation) occurred in some cases.  Genes located in the mitochondria  (extranuclear cellular organelles) have a higher rate of evolution on average than nuclear genes  and chances are higher that more mutations accumulate during rapid evolutionary radiations.   Hence the potential advantage of combining the existing data sets (morphological and nuclear)  with mitochondrial data.   The major aim of this project is to clarify the relationships among New World monkey genera.   For this purpose, the researchers intend to: 1) sequence a mitochondrial gene, the 12S ribosomal  gene in all genera of New World monkeys, to conduct a study of their evolutionary relationships;  2) combine the 12S sequences with published nuclear, morphological and preliminary  mitochondrial data to generate a `total evidence` evolutionary tree;  3) evaluate different  methods to assign differential weights to individual characters.  The researchers will assume that  a method that yields the species of  callithrichids, pithecines, and atelines, assorted in that way,  performs better than a method that does not, because these are well corroborated relationships.  The project is significance because: 1) it furthers  knowledge about the poorly known  evolutionary relationships among New World monkeys; 2) it provides a phylogenetic framework  to test hypotheses of evolution in this group; 3) it provides a test of the performance of different  weighting methods.",
