 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to develop methodologies for the   preparation of chiral metallic cavities for catalytic synthesis. The   concept is to build, via template methodology, a polymeric cavity into   which a metal can be placed and used as a chiral catalyst. In this   methodology, both the outer an inner sphere environments of the metal   catalyst shall be controlled. In the education portion of this grant, the   overall goal is to integrate organic and organometallic chemistry in   courses, research and seminars. Students will write papers and give   lectures on current literature topics which cover these two   sub-disciplines.  The ability to catalyze reactions efficiently provides the basis for   transforming readily available organic materials into numerous useful   products. For medicinal products, one additional feature is the control   of chiral topology. This research project supported by the Organic   Dynamics Program will address this issue by designing chiral polymeric   cavities into which chiral metal catalysts can be tethered. A variety of   test examples will be used to demonstrate the concept utility. The   education portion of this investigation will focus on the integration of   Organic and Organometallic chemistry. This will be done by course work,   seminars and research at both the undergraduate and graduate level",
