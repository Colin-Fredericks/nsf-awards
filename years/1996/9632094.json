 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632094  Reisman  This proposal involves a number of senior undergraduate design  projects targeted at aiding the disabled.  Through their work,  the students will design and implement new technologies, fulfill  academic requirements, and produce a usable device.  The target  population, or consumers, includes individuals with spinal cord  injuries, stroke survivors, individuals with sensory or  neurologic deficiency, and geriatric individuals.  The work will  be performed in conjunction with the Kessler Institute for  Rehabilitation in West Orange, New Jersey.  The primary objective  of the proposed projects is to increase safety and independence  for their consumers.  The devices produced will be designed with  particular attention to affordability, reliability and  portability.  More specifically, the projects will address  problems in personal hygiene (e.g., feeding, dressing and  toileting), and difficulties in verbal, written and telephone  communication.  The projects will also include devices for  handling money and credit cards when driving, page turning and  accessing laptop computers.  ***",
