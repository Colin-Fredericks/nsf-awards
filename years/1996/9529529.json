Iowa State University    Computer System Security Laboratory      A research laboratory in computer system security is supported by this grant. The projects targeted for the laboratory collectively address the problems of denial of service and intrusion detection, two problems of increasing importance as the nation becomes dependent on the computer communication infrastructure.  Research has identified several methods of attacks that can render a network unusable. Hardware obtained from this grant will facilitate the establishment of a laboratory with an isolated subnet, a network logic analyzer, and several UNIX-based workstations and personal computers.  In this environment, the researchers have full control of all components so that network traffic can be closely monitored, and denial of service experiments can be safely and fully explored.   The end goal of the collection of projects outlined in the proposal is to develop an insight into potential countermeasures for intrusion and denial of service attacks.",
