The asymptotic analysis is based on the study of   local empirical processes, modern probabilistic results for mixing sequences   and sharp data-driven estimators of spectral density. Data-driven estimators   for the case of small sample sizes are explored both theoretically via   oracle inequalities and numerically via intensive Monte Carlo study.   %%%     The research involves the development of optimal methods for the    recovery of images that arise in different scientific problems including:   (i) secretion of  hormones such as insulin secretion where   no other methods have been successful so far due to noisy, long-dependent   and indirect data; (ii) monitoring quality of water based   on the analysis of large, correlated and sparse data sets that have undergone   efficient, computationally intensive data-compression;   (iii) timing of geological events, including plate motions and climatological   variations; (iv) testing and modeling properties of new materials.      ***",
