 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general chemistry laboratory experience at most large public institutions in this country is characterized by tedious manipulations that often appear to take precedence over the development of an appreciation for the underlying physical phenomena. The chemistry department is removing the busy work from laboratories by introducing computer equipment and commercially available transparent interfaces for data acquisition and analysis. These laboratory workstations serve as platforms for molecular visualization. They allow students to learn more while they stimulate student interest in science. The intention is not to replace wet chemistry experiments with computer simulations, but rather to bring the data-collection methods used in those experiments into the modern era. In short, the focus in these courses is shifting from data generation to data interpretation and understanding. By making routine use of computers in the large service courses, the university maximizes the number of students affected by the project and provides the largest possible audience with a modern approach to the practice of chemistry.",
