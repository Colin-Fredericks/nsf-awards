 "awd_abstract_narration": "Case Western Reserve University has made a major commitment to revitalize its Department of Chemistry. Funding from the National Science Foundation will enable the institution in this endeavor by renovating research and research training areas.  Currently the Chemistry Department is separated between the Morely Chemical Laboratory and the Millis Building.  Laboratories housed within Morely, originally built in 1908, are dilapidated, and would be inordinately expensive to rectify conditions due to structural and spatial constraints.  Constructed in 1962, research space in Millis has serious inadequacies as a site to conduct modern, sophisticated research in the traditional areas of organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry.  The project entails repairing Millis in order to consolidate the department in one building, thus ameliorating the dispersion and fragmentation of research groups and shared equipment.  Renovations include upgrading laboratory layouts to current standards of efficiency and safety. New air management and environmental control systems will improve air quality and energy efficiency.  Deteriorated fume hood, lab benches, cabinets, and sinks will be replaced or refurbished. Laboratory and access elements that are not fully ADA compatible are to be replaced, and a sprinkler system will be installed for fire safety.  Improved facilities will not only enhance the Department's  contributions to high priority  research, but it will strengthen training opportunities needed to sustain its recruitment of a highly qualified and diverse group of students.",
