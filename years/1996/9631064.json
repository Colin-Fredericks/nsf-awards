 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631064  Adams    The proposed studies will examine the low temperature acclimation  of   a   photoprotective   process  facilitating   the   harmless  dissipation  of  excess excitation energy in plants  that  retain  leaves  during  the  winter.  Excess  excitation  energy  can  be  removed   directly   within   the  chlorophyll/carotenoid-binding  pigment   complexes  in  a  process  requiring   the   carotenoid  zeaxanthin and a low pH within the chloroplast membrane. On  warm  days,    under   otherwise   favorable   conditions,   zeaxanthin  accumulates  during  midday  when  light  is  excessive  and   is  reconverted  to  its precursor by the end of  the  day  as  light  levels  become nonexcessive.  During the winter large amounts  of  zeaxanthin  can  be  retained throughout cold  nights,  ready  to  become  engaged  in  energy dissipation the  instant  chlorophyll  absorbs  light  in  the  morning.  In the  proposed  studies  the  mechanisms  underlying the nocturnal retention of  this  pigment,  and  its  continued  engagement for energy dissipation,  will  be  examined.    The   first  mechanism  involves  the   hypothesized  maintenance  of a pH gradient across the photosynthetic  membrane  of  leaves  exposed  to winter conditions which  results  in  the  sustained   engagement  of  zeaxanthin  in  energy   dissipation,  primarily  in  the minor, proximal chlorophyll-binding  proteins.  The  second  mechanism  to  be tested involves  the  hypothesized  synthesis  of  zeaxanthin from beta-carotene in the core  antenna  proteins  that  may  accompany acclimation to the  conditions  of  excess  light  during  the winter.  To test this  hypothesis  the  carotenoid composition of specific chloroplast proteins  will  be  determined  from  leaves acclimated to favorable temperatures  in  the summer as well as low temperatures in the winter.  Ultimately  the information gleaned through these studies may prove useful in  improving the tolerance of agricultural species planted in  areas  th at experience lower temperatures than those experienced by  the  plants during their evolutionary history.",
