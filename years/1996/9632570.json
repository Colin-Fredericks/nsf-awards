Thermal spray coatings  are crucial to the economic, safe, and efficient operation of a wide  variety of engineering components. The Center has a focus on key scientific  issues which are likely to play a role in thermal spray processing.  The  research is carried out in two interdisciplinary research groups.  One  group integrates diagnostics and modeling of the plasma spray process in  order to develop tools for generating process designs and intelligent  control strategies.  A second group concentrates on basic understanding of  the relationship between processing, microstructure, and properties of the  thermal spray product. Details of the microstructures will be linked  through modeling to activities in the first group.  Special emphasis is  placed on measurement of mechanical properties and on application of a  variety of sophisticated characterization tools.  The MRSEC supports the  development, operation and maintenance of shared experimental facilities  for materials research.  It provides seed funding for exploratory research  and emerging areas, and fosters research participation by undergraduates.  The MRSEC has strong industrial links and an educational outreach program  from the pre-college to the graduate level.  The Center currently supports  13 senior investigators, 3 postdoctoral research associates, 1 technician,  8 graduate students, and 4 undergraduates.  The MRSEC is directed by  Professor Herbert Herman.  %%%  The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the  University of New York at Stony Brook supports research in the area of  thermal spray processing and associated materials.
