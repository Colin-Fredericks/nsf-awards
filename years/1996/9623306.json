 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623306  Zuo  The objective of this proposal is to find the generic features  common to both the layered organic and the high temperature  superconductors in order to better understand the vortex dynamics  in these systems.  Several experiments will be performed to this  purpose.  First, the phenomena of anomalous magnetization where  magnetization increases abnormally with increasing field in the  mixed state will be studied in both organic and the Thallium  based cuprates superconductors where the superconducting  transition temperature can be varied.  Second, interlayer  transport measurements will be performed to correlate  with a  magnetic transparent state observed in the neodymium-cerium based  superconductors as well as the thallium based ones to test the  model of the Josephson decoupling between the superconducting  layers.  Third, a point contact technique will be applied to test  a model of spontaneous creations of free vortices due to thermal  fluctuations in layered compounds.  Fourth, an important  phenomena of quantum interference of moving vortex lattice with a  rf electromagnetic field will be tested in the organic  superconductors.  The organics may prove to be an ideal system to  establish the quantum interference picture because of  its  extremely weak pinning.  Current voltage response will be  measured as a function of flux flow velocity and the rf  field.  Understanding of the vortex dynamics in the layered  superconductors is important for its industrial applications,  it  is also interesting in terms of fundamental physics.  %%%  Understanding of the magnetic properties in the high temperature  superconductors is critical for applications of these materials  as current carrying devices.  It is equally interesting in  terms  of fundamental physics involved.  The high transition temperature  and the layered structure introduce new features in the behavior  of quantum vortices in the mixed state.  For example, the  magnetization or critical current in the mixed state incre ases  abnormally with increasing field.  Preliminary studies suggest it  is due to dimensional crossover when the quantum vortices changes  from 3 dimensional lines to 2 dimensional pancakes.  This  proposal aims toward establishing a generic picture by comparing  the high temperature superconductors with a structurally  analogous low temperature organic superconductors.  Several key  experiments will be performed to test the models proposed for the  layered superconductors.  These include comparative studies of  anomalous magnetization in both systems, direct measurement of  coupling between the superconducting layers, detection of  spontaneous generated thermal vortices, and an interference  effect between the quantum vortices and an incident  electromagnetic wave.  The knowledge gained from this study will  provide better understanding of physics in the mixed state, as  well as novel applications of these materials.  ***",
