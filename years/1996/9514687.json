 "awd_abstract_narration": "King  9514687      Successful reproduction in animal species requires the release of  an egg from the ovary, known as ovulation.  Ovulation requires the  joint action of a part of the brain, known as the hypothalamus, and  the pituitary gland.  A chemical substance released by the  hypothalamus, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), is  transported by the blood to the pituitary gland and acts on cells  therein to enhance the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) which  helps prime the ovary for ovulation.  The exact mechanism involved  in LHRH secretion into the bloodstream is currently a mystery but  through the efforts of Dr. King, she has demonstrated marked  cellular reorganization within the vascular portion of the  hypothalamus, known as the median eminence, that facilitates  chemical secretion by the brain.  Dr. King is using the state of  the art microscopic techniques to investigate the anatomical  relationship between the cells producing LHRH and glial support  cells in the median eminence and the changes in this relationship  occurring at the time LHRH is secreted.  Dr. King is also examining  the role of excitatory neurotransmitters in the dynamic  relationship between LHRH-containing cells, glial cells, and the  blood vessels themselves during the remodeling at the time of LHRH  secretion.  Studies to identify the cellular components involved in  communication between these cells that stimulate reorganization are  underway.  These studies examine the local regulation of brain LHRH  secretion.  The coordinated secretion of LHRH is responsible for  the regulation of reproductive abilities in animals and  understanding these mechanisms is central to the survival of all  animal species, domestic or wild, including man.",
