 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the purchase of computers and nine pieces of software in order to integrate state-of-the-art molecular visualization and computational chemistry into the organic and general chemistry courses.   Problems addressed by this project include the cost of maintaining equipment, such as infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrophotometers, for instructional purposes; the need to revise instruction in organic chemistry to keep up with developments in the actual practice of chemistry; the challenge of motivating introductory-level students and non-science-majors; and the difficulty of helping students visualize three-dimensional molecular structures.   The objectives are to (1) develop and incorporate exercises which teach chemistry concepts using software to simulate actual equipment; (2) develop and implement a revised organic chemistry curriculum that mates computation with experimentation and provides students with clear understanding of molecular structure and computational chemistry; and (3) use computer-enhanced instruction to illustrate the real-world relevance of the material being taught to help students visualize the structure they are studying and to motivate student learning.   To accomplish these objectives, the project director has carefully selected software and has conceived curricular revisions and exercises. Substantial time has been devoted to developing a proposed reshaping of the relevant laboratory curricula so as to deliver significant instructional enhancement.   This project can have significant impact in advancing chemistry students' understanding and in enabling introductory students and nonmajors to see the importance of the submicroscopic world.",
