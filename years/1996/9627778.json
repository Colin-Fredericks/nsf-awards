 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627778  Freericks/Liu    This grant supports a new program, consisting of two young  faculty members, one female (A. Liu) in condensed matter  physics at the Georgetown University.  The grant supports  work on a careful and detailed analysis of the electron-  phonon interaction based theory of superconductivity in the  regimes where Migdal's theorem is no longer valid.  This  work also takes advantage of new theoretical tools that have  been developed for many body problems in large dimensions  (or alternatively large coordination number for atoms).  The  work proposed here includes first principles calculation of  the spectral densities (SD), derivation of SD from the  experimental tunneling data using more accurate algorithm,  incorporate vertex corrections in the theory of  superconductivity and analyze the effects of lattice  anharmonicity.  %%%  This grant is to support collaborative research of two young  faculty (one female) with complementary  interests and  expertise in the theory of superconductivity at Georgetown  University. A major difference between the conventional  superconductors and essentially all of the ones that have  been discovered recently (doped fullerenes, high Tc  materials) is that the theoretical framework, so successful  in elucidating superconductivity in conventional materials,  cannot be applied to the new materials.  This project is to  consider the associated difficulties and find solutions for  them.  ***",
