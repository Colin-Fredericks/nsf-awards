 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program will   provide a grant to Franklin and Marshall College for Dr. Ronald Musselman   to determine polarizations of intense electronic transitions related to   conductivity in new materials and to bonding in metalloprotein models   using a unique Polarized Specular Reflectance microspectrophotometer.    This is a renewal proposal describing a highly collaborative effort with   Dr. Steven Watkins of Louisiana State University, Dr. Don Ellis and Dr.   Brian Hoffman of Northwestern University, Dr. H. J. Keller of the   University of Heidelberg, Dr. Alberto Flamini of the National Research   Council of Italy, and Dr. Edward Solomon of Stanford. The work at   Franklin and Marshall College will involve six undergraduate students who   will participate in making the measurements and in doing the calculations   on a variety of complexes that are of chemical and biochemical interest.   This program will help to refine the theoretical treatment of conductive   square-planar metal complexes, and of their molecular precursors. A   series of structurally related square planar metal complexes will be   synthesized allowing systematic comparisons to be made between experiment   and theory and thus enhancing our understanding of the electronic   properties of these types of compounds.  This program will address the fundamental nature of the interaction of   light with new materials. The materials of interest range from   electronically conducting materials to systems with biological   significance such as enzymes.  Often the characteristics of these   materials which make them intrinsically interesting also cause them to   completely absorb the light normally used to probe the nature of the   system.  The unique feature of this work is the ability to probe these   systems using a reflectance technique (specular reflectance) which   provides information closely related to that normally obtained by   absorbance methods.  Experimental measurements will be performed and the   results will be interpreted using sophisticated calculations in order to   gain fundamental new insights into the behavior of such systems.    Specific knowledge concerning the nature of the chemical bonding in these   systems will result from this work, and it has implications for   understanding how electrons are transmitted within and how light   interacts with conducting materials.",
