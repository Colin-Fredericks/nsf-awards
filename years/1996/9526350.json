 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry Program, will support the continuation of studies by Professor   Patricia A. Shapley, of the University of Illinois, into the   organometallic chemistry of the iron triad.  A major area for   consideration is the chemistry of alkyl-imido-cyclopentadienylosmium(VI)   and -ruthenium(VI) complexes, which transfer the imido group to organic   substrates.  Attempts will be made to synthesis oxo and sulfido analogs   that will also react with organic substrates to transfer these groups.  A   secondary objective of this phase of the work is to make these reactions   catalytic and/or chiral.  Chiral forms of  heteronuclear species formed   from a dialkyl nitridoosmium complex and chromate ion, which was earlier   found to oxidize primary and secondary alcohols, have recently been   synthesized.  Attempts will be made to resolve these complexes and study   their effectiveness as reagents for chiral resolution of secondary   alcohols.  A third area to be considered is the preparation and study of   high oxidation state alkyl iron (III/IV) complexes, and neutral oxo   iron(IV) complexes.  The former will be generated by chemical or   electrochemical oxidation of known alkyliron(II) complexes and the latter   from reduction of the ferrate anion.  Some examples of oxoiron(IV)   complexes that are soluble in organic solvents are already available.  This project has as its primary objective the acquisition of a   fundamental understanding of the chemical reactivity of several new   classes of organometallic compounds that contain one of the elements from   the iron family.  Whereas the specific objectives are to understand the   factors that determine the stability and reactivity of these compounds,   there is considerable potential for the development of reagents that have   applications in the synthesis of organic compounds.  This may ultimately   provide for better ways to synthesize known biologically active   compounds, or to prepare new ones.",
