 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514331  MADDOX    The long-term objective of this research is to better understand  the perceptual and cognitive processes involved when a person  identifies or categorizes objects.  This research will  investigate the complex interplay between perceptual and  decisional processes within the theoretical framework of General  Recognition theory which is a multivariate generalization of  Signal Detection Theory.  This research will investigate several   important aspects of human behavior.  First, this research will  investigate the optimality of human categorization performance  when category baserates and category payoffs are unequal.  This  is an important issue, because baserate and payoff differences  are ubiquitous in nature; for example, disease categories often  differ in their frequency and in the costs and benefits  associated with various diagnoses.  Since the goal of the  physician is to diagnose a patient accurately, efficient use of  baserate and payoff information is extremely important.  This  research will not only allow one to determine the optimality of  human performance, but will assist in identifying the locus of  any potential suboptimalities.  Second, this research will  examine the time it takes an individual to arrive at an  identification or categorization decision.  The  focus will be on  identifying the environmental factors that influence response  time, such as whether the components of the object can be  attended selectively, or whether the identification or  categorization  problem is complex, etc.  A major goal will be to  test several extant theories of response time, including the   response time predictions from General Recognition Theory.  This  work complements the baserate and payoff analyses because not  only does the physician want to make an accurate diagnosis, but  in many cases the physician is under severe time pressure.   Third, this research will investigate the relationship between  the identification and categorization of objects.  The focus will   be on understanding how perceptual and decisional processes  differ across tasks.  The results of this research will allow us  to better understand human identification and categorization  behavior, and ultimately influence these behaviors in a  productive and useful manner.    ***",
