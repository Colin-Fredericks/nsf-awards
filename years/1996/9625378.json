 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Peter K. Dorhout, Department of Chemistry, Colorado State University,   is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career Development Award    for studies of the use of Zintl ion building blocks in material   synthesis.  Lanthanide Zintl ion materials will be synthesized using a   building block concept whereby known Zintl phase structures are examined   as precursors to and reactants for new materials.  New lanthanide   selenodiphosphate and selenoantimonate compounds will be prepared from   molten salt reactions at moderate temperatures.  These materials are   expected to show thermoelectric and/or antiferromagnetic behavior, and   these properties and their theoretical basis will be examined. The   educational plan is aimed at developing new laboratory experiments in   X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis, a new course in solid state   chemistry, and an undergraduate research program.  Unique combinations of elements from various portions of the periodic   table can result in solid state materials with new and useful properties.    The synthesis of these types of materials is frequently approached in an   empirical, trial-and-error fashion by combining the elements at high   temperature.  This proposal combines Zintl ions, negatively charged   clusters of main group elements, with lanthanide metals in a systematic   and rational building block approach.  This approach is aimed at   developing low temperature synthetic routes to these materials, and a   fundamental understanding of the basis for the observed physical   properties of these materials. These materials may posess unique   conducting and magnetic properties, and the advances in synthetic   methodology and in the theoretical understanding of these systems will   allow for the design of new materials with predictable physical   properties.  The educational plan focuses on curriculum development,   student mentoring, and research.",
