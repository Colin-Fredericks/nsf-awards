 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632593 Bedzyk  This research project addresses critical aspects of heteroepitaxial growth of semiconductor structures including effects of strain, surfactants(growth related adsorbates including dopants), and alteration of surface kinetic phenomena through surfactant species.  The approach employs the x-ray standing wave(XSW) technique utilizing advanced light sources at national facilities along with more conventional surface science techniques at Northwestern to focus on the structure, adsorption, and transformation kinetics of growth-related species on the surface of a growing, strained heterolayer.  In-situ studies undertaken will center on the molecular beam epitaxy of elements from groups IV-IV on silicon and germanium substrates.  The high resolution XSW data will provide atomic positions within a strained overlayer with a precision of 0.01 Angstroms, and will be used as a stringent test of theoretical models and simulations. %%% The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level of technological relevance to several aspects of advanced electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
