The theme of the MRSEC is the  understanding and control of materials at the nanostructural  level.  The Center supports an extensive program of research  experience for undergraduates and a new program of outreach to  pre-college students in upstate New York, including collaborative  efforts with a local science museum.  The Center will also  support seed funding for exploratory research and emerging areas  of materials science.  The MRSEC supports enhanced collaboration  with industry and extensive shared experimental facilities that  also support research not directly funded by the MRSEC.  As part  of the Center's search for new materials, the molecular inorganic-  organic composites group will focus on innovative approaches for  preparing and characterizing novel nanoscale inorganic-organic  molecular composites.  The group studying thin films on glass  proposes systematic studies of disordered surfaces and thin film  deposition on glass.  The research addresses a rich array of  phenomena that are not currently understood, and has potential  application for large area electronics, a growing segment of the  communications and display industry.  Thin film deposition by  energetic ion and atom beams can alter thin film growth  substantially, leading to new structures, new compositions, and  smooth ultra-thin films with improved properties.  This group  seeks to understand the microscopic processes underlying these  effects.  Uniquely structured nanoscale materials that isolate a  few defects (or even a single one) will be used by the metallic  nanostructure group to elucidate fundamental issues arising from  defects and impurities.  Magnetic interactions, defects and  impurities can produce dramatic effects in quantum systems.  The  Center currently supports about 35 senior investigators, 8  postdoctoral research associates, 12 t echnicians or other  professionals, 36 graduate students, and 25 undergraduates.  The  MRSEC is directed by Professor John Silcox.  %%%  The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at  Cornell University supports interactive research in four  interdisciplinary groups.
