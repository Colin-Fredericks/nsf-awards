 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this CAREER award is to develop a fully integrated career plan  designed to meet the educational needs of students in the Electrical and Computer  Engineering (ECE) Department of Northeastern University.  The underlying theme  behind all aspects of this work is the study of inverse problems, a topic which  is all but absent at the undergraduate level and not often considered even in the  graduate school despite the ubiquity of these problems in many fields of  engineering and the applied sciences.    In the area of educations activities, two projects are envisioned.  At the  undergraduate level, a capstone design course in the general area of signal  processing is being developed and implemented.  At the graduate level, a course  devoted to the study of the theoretical and practical issues surrounding linear  inverse problems is being developed.    In the area of research, we are exploring the use of statistical and multiscale  signal processing methods for solving non-linear electromagnetic inverse  scattering problems.  These algorithms will incorporate scattering models based  upon a Green's function formulation of the vector Helholtz equation.  A  statistically-based, multi-grid-type algorithm for extracting image and target  information (number of targets, locations, and classifications) is being  developed.  The incorporation of detailed, physical models directly into the data  processing algorithms makes these techniques directly applicable to a wide range  of problems including radar signal processing for image formation and target  detection/classification, remote sensing, microwave medical imaging, and  geophysical exploration.",
