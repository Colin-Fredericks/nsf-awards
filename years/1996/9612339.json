Treasure Island, an artificial island in San Francisco Bay,  California, approaches ideal conditions for a full-scale field  experiment to study the response of soft ground during strong  earthquake shaking. It is located between the San Andreas and  Hayward faults, on which a magnitude 7 or greater earthquake is  expected to occur within the next thirty years, with a  probability greater than 67%. The major instrumented site on the  island, which is one of the National Geotechnical Experimentation  Sites, is located on 300 feet of soil, including 40 feet of  hydraulic fill sand, underlain by soft to hard clays. It is  adjacent to Yerba Buena island, a rock outcrop, thus permitting  motions of the rock outcrop, deep bedrock, and soil to be  measured and compared.    Currently, instrumentation at the \"fire station\" site on Treasure  Island includes six accelerometers in a vertical array between  bedrock and the ground surface, as well as six piezometers in the  upper potentially-liquefiable hydraulic fill. The installation of  these instruments (completed in 1993) was accompanied by an  extensive site characterization program. Support for the Treasure  Island National Geotechnical Experimentation Site has been a  collaboration between the U.S. Navy, National Science Foundation,  Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Geological Survey,  California Division of Mines and Geology, Electric Power Research  Institute and the University of California at Davis.    The major questions to be addressed by this workshop are: What is  the best use of strong motion information so as to improve or  create models to predict the behavior of soft soils under strong  ground motion? What additional site information is required?    The goal of this workshop is to assure that all the major pieces  of information are in pla ce at the time of the next major  earthquake, so that the data obtained can quickly and efficiently  be used by researchers, and thus lead to rapid development of  improved techniques for predicting the behavior of soft soils  under strong ground shaking.  ***",
