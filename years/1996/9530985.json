 "awd_abstract_narration": "The   goal  of  this  research  is  to  develop  appearance-based  representations  of three-dimensional scenes that  permit  images  corresponding to a continuous range of views of the scene  to  be  synthesized by adaptively combining a set of basis images.  These  steerable appearance models analytically model the effects  of  a  moving  camera  on scene appearance.  The approach  is  based  on  decomposing  scene  appearance into  three  separate  components:  epipolar  motion,  visibility, and photometric properties,  which  together  determine  how  the scene will  appear  from  arbitrary  viewpoints.    Each   component  is   represented   and   steered  independently  before  being combined to  produce  views  of  the  scene.   The  components are directly computable from  the  basis  images    under   certain   conditions,   avoiding    traditional  difficulties caused by ill-posed problems and complex  3-D  scene  recovery tasks.  The research centers around the dual problems of  measurability and steerability, which provide a formal basis  for  designing  and  evaluating  the  proposed  models.  Measurability  defines  the conditions under which it is possible to  recover  a  representation   from  a  set  of  basis  images.    Steerability  specifies the range of views that may be reconstructed as well as  the  mechanism  for  producing them.  Results  should  provide  a  better  theoretical  understanding  of  the  dynamic  effects  of  viewpoint   on  scene  appearance.   Potential  applications   of  steerable appearance models will be investigated, such  as  three  dimensional   object  recognition  based  on  viewpoint-dependent  grayscale  appearance,  and visual map  construction  of  unknown  three-dimensional environments by active exploration.",
