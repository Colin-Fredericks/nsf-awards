Proposal #: 9529819           Keeping  in mind that the program weighs secondary considerations  in  the  individual award/no-award decisions, it is still informative to  look  at  the numerical rating statistics to have some feeling for the level  of  competition for available funds. For the regular panels, award  rates  are  currently  about 15% of the total proposals received. We have made  recent  efforts  to  let  the reviewers and panels know clearly what  the  general  level  of  competition for funds is like, expecting  that  evaluations  of  individuals   proposals  and  discrimination  among   proposal   will   be  influenced  to  a degree by this information. In this panel,  50%  of  the  proposals  had  average numerical mail review rankings  of  very  good  or  better  (~2.0 on a scale where 1=Excellent and 5=Poor). With the pressures  of  increased  costs of doing research (and increased dollar  requests  in  proposals),  the  directive to make longer-term awards,  the  consistently  large  number of proposals submitted to the regular panels,  and  with  no  increases  in  funds  to  support research  in  areas  not  identified  as  strategic initiatives, the Program expects that we will continue  to  face  the  unpleasant  reality of not recommending many  important,  worthy  and  high-rated proposals for support by the Foundation.",
