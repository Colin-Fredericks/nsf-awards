 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9505411  Worthington   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 11 project will conduct the necessary research required to produce the Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) technology for use as semi-conductor wafer temperature measurement. Phase I successfully demonstrated the DRS technique. Phase 11 will adapt and extend the DRS technology and: 1) build a DRS temperature measurement materials data base, 2) develop the DRS technology for a process control interface, and 3) add other process monitoring capabilities to the DRS spectrometer. Research will be conducted in three research venues. First,   national laboratory collaborators will collect data on GaAs wafer materials.  Second, the University of Washington will collect data on surface morphology,  and epilayer growth. Third, Thermionics Northwest will: analyze the data received from the research partners, construct a low cost improved performance DRS wafer temperature sensor, collect and analyze data on Si wafers, and increase the temperature measure range of the DRS technique for Si.   The control of wafer temperature is critical to film thickness, uniformity and quality. Most wafer processes require temperature measurement and control to increase yield and device density. In-situ temperature sensing with real-time data acquisition is needed for process control. The research conducted in Phase 11 will support product development of one or more process control products using the DRS technology for semi-conductor research and production facilities.  ***",
