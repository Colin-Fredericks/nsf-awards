 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626154  Yan  The investigator studies incompressible flows governed by the  Navier-Stokes equations or Burgers' equation.  Some special  issues are studied in depth.  Various types of control objectives  (minimizing velocity tracking, drag, vorticity) and control  parameters (distributed control and boundary control) are  studied.  Long-time dynamics of controlled flows is the main  subject of this project.  The long-time behavior of  global-in-time and piecewise-in-time optimal controls are studied  in different settings.  Numerical schemes for computing the  control problems are designed and their performance is analyzed.   Effectiveness of control is analyzed for both continuous and  discrete systems; the latter is particularly close to the design  of practical control.  Numerical schemes are implemented to  evaluate the effectiveness of the control problems.  The  numerical results both reinforce the theoretical results and  reveal more quantitative information of the controlled dynamics.    Improving the design and control of modern aircraft can be  achieved through optimal design of wings, engines, etc, or  through the active control of air flowing over wings and into  engines.  The project studies issues basic to active control.   The investigator develops new mathematical and computational  tools that provide good engineering insight and practical design  criteria for controlling fluid motions in aerodynamic and  hydrodynamic systems.  This requires high performance  computational resources an order of magnitude greater than  typical modeling for uncontrolled flows.  Direct applications can  also be found in the design of submarine body shape and  propelling systems.",
