 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the renovation of research space in the Chemistry Building at the University of Iowa.  Laboratories located on the 5th floor of the southeast wing of the building, that were constructed in 1922, will be renovated for  students and four productive faculty members who have established national and international reputations for excellence and innovation in synthetic chemical research. Existing laboratories lack the essential infrastructure required to conduct modern chemistry.  There is currently no provision for ventilation, central air-conditioning, or make-up air in any of the rooms.  All have poor lighting, and cannot house any research operation that involves extensive use of volatile materials or any potentially toxic gases.  Targeted research space is devoid of the appropriate laboratory benches, sinks, fume hoods, electrical service, and HVAC facilities. Moreover, the crowded conditions under which these groups operate include numerous potential serious safety hazards to research personnel.  This project will correct these deficiencies and make unsuitable space into a safe and conducive research environment.  Improvements will allow these scientists to expand their research operations, and facilitate the accommodation of visiting scientists from industry and academic institutions in the US and abroad.  The upgraded facility will contribute to the research and educational goals of the University of Iowa by assisting the institution in its efforts to recruit future faculty hires.",
