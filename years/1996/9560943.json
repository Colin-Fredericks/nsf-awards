 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to determine the suitability of Stimpson's Surfclam (Mactromeris polynyma) for aquaculture development in northern New England from biological, technical and commercial perspectives.  Presently, there are too many unanswered questions about this surfclam's biology, environmental requirements and marketability to encourage aquaculture development.  The objectives of this project are to 1) determine the environmental requirements necessary to optimize growth and survival of M. polynyma in northern New England waters, 2) develop management techniques to efficiently grow this species to market size within 2-3 years, 3) determine the impact of toxic algal blooms on the culture and marketability of this species and 4) conduct a marketing survey and consumer preference study in order to predict market acceptance and demand for this new product in the United States and Japan.       The results of this research will provide aquaculturists with the information they need to decide whether or not to commercially cultivate this species.  Potentially, a new seafood product could be developed and marketed in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest.  Results from this project will also provide fishery managers and public health officials with much needed information about the impacts of toxic blooms on this commercial species.",
