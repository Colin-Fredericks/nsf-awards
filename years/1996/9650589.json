 "awd_abstract_narration": "Of the over 600 students taking the 2-term general chemistry laboratory, only about 20 proceed through the senior-level instrumental analysis course. In this department, as in most level-one universities, only those students who complete this last laboratory course receive a thorough theoretical and practical (hands-on) experience with two of the most important and widely used analytical techniques_gas chromatography (GC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).    However, many of the more than 200 students who do not advance past sophomore-level chemistry will use GC or HPLC in their careers. The need for these students to receive a sound fundamental background in the use and understanding of these techniques cannot be overly stressed. Furthermore, the learning experience of students who take the advanced lab classes would be enhanced if they had a stronger chromatography background in the lower-level courses. This project addresses the lack of coherent, step-by-step development of chromatographic theory and practice from the introductory through advanced level courses and the lack of practical, hands-on experience in GC and HPLC by the majority of students who take chemistry. The objective of this project is to alleviate both of these problems by integrating the teaching of chromatography into most of the undergraduate laboratory courses. This aim is being accomplished by modifying and replacing experiments in these courses to provide students with more theory and hands-on experience using the new equipment. This project is improving the level of chromatography instruction in the department and, through presentations at meetings and publications in education journals, may improve chromatography instruction at other schools.",
