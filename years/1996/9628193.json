 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project takes a broad information-theoretic approach to the exchange  of information over a network of many users in the presence of interference  and noise. The problems considered include:  distributed transmission and  reception of information;  distributed computation; distributed  data-compression; the cooperative use of distributed data;  the role of  feedback in communication networks; the theoretical contrast of CDMA, TDMA  and FDMA in mobile communication environments; and the investigation of  distortion-free rate distortion theory.  Also considered are certain  information-theoretic questions concerning: speech processing;  speech  recognition;  data compression; investment; energy bounds for computation;  and thermodynamics.  It may also be possible to show the formal identity of  rate-distortion theory and investment theory and ultimately to demonstrate  that the work in universal data compression can apply directly to universal  investment algorithms.  The research seeks a unified view of distributed  communication and data processing.  Steps toward such a theory should have  good practical applications, as recent advances in CDMA and universal data  compression attest.",
