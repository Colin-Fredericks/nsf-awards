Late Cenozoic glaciation directly  affected sedimentation on more than half the Earth's continental  shelves.  Ice continues to be a dominant influence on  sedimentation around Greenland and on the shelves facing the  Arctic ocean as well as around Antarctica.  Elsewhere,  glacimarine sedimentation is of particular significance on the  shelves of North America, north of, northwest Europe and Russia,  which were strongly influenced by the Late Cenozoic Glaciation,  though now ice is a minor factor.  The features of these shelves  include true glacimarine features, i.e. those formed in a marine  environment in proximity to, or strongly under the influence of,  ice, and diamictons resulting from ice rafting.  Also found,  since large areas of the shelves were exposed during the  Pleistocene lowering of sea level, are terrestrial glacial and  periglacial features, e.g. fluvial outwash valleys and associated  deposits, tunnel valleys, drumlin fields, lodgement till, which  have subsequently been submerged and modified by marine  influences.  Better understanding of present-day glacimarine  environments will enhance interpretation of the stratigraphic  record in terms of past environments and the possible global  climate changes implied by these interpretations, while from an  immediate practical standpoint, recognizing and understanding the  features of glaciated shelves will become increasingly  significant as the search for energy and mineral resources  extends to higher latitudes and into submerged regions.    The planned Atlas of Glacimarine Features will provide a  reference for professionals, teachers and students showing  typical examples of sea floor and sub sea floor features seen in  glacio-marine environments, as these appear in seismic records  (single and multi-channel seismic reflection, high resolution,  side scan).  Likely users of the atlas will include Qua ternary  scientists, marine geologists, geophysicists, geotechnical  engineers, and surveyors working in universities, research  institutions and government agencies, as well as those in  industries with offshore interests (petroleum and hard mineral  exploration and production, civil engineering, waste disposal,  environmental concerns, etc.).  The atlas will be assembled under  the guidance of an international editorial committee from  contributions submitted by members of the scientific community.  Publication is planned for late 1996.",
