(MMI), Virginia, and Dr. Ramiro Perez Campo,  Universidad Autonoma de Mejico (UNAM), Cuernavaca.    They  will conduct research on coatings applied to metallic  substrates by a developmental MMI coating procedure called  pulsed electrode surfacing (PES), in order to determine its  effectiveness on three environments - high stress wear,  corrosion, and oxidation.  MMI will fabricate the  experimental coated specimens and the Physics Institute in  UNAM will define and conduct the environmental exposure  testing and perform the primary characterization of  specimens and will evaluate the effectiveness of the  coatings to withstand the test environments.    Wear problems exist in many engineering applications  involving machinery and  equipment, but they have not  received the same detailed attention as corrosion problems.  To solve wear problems it is first necessary to identify the  predominant wear mechanisms that have contributed to  failure.  MMI believes that PES is an important, generic  technology to address and alleviate not only wear, but  corrosion and elevated temperature oxidation problems as  well.  ***",
