First,  studies  will  be  carried  out to further verify and understand the novel  type  of  deep defect relaxation in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)  that has been suggested by capacitance transient measurements  in  the  previous phase of this research. These experimental  studies  will focus on (1) observing relaxation through its effect on  the  optical  spectra associated with deep defects in a-Si:H, and  (2)  comparing  modulated photocurrent spectra (which also indicate  a  defect  relaxation effect) with electron spin resonance  data  to  identify  the  deep  defect  sub-bands responsible.  Second,  the  project  will investigate the deep defect properties of  a  novel  form  of  carbon containing a predominance of tetrahedral bonding  (ta-C).  This  material has recently been made with  sufficiently  good  semiconducting properties to be amenable  to  our  junction  capacitance  methods.  The disclosed deep defect  properties  are  likely   to  be  fundamentally  different  than  those   of   the  tetrahedral amorphous semiconductors based on Si and Ge.  %%%  Amorphous or \"glassy\" materials represent a true frontier area to  test  our  understanding of solid state physics. One increasingly  important  class  of such materials are amorphous  semiconductors  such  as  hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H).   This  latter  material  is  finding  important  technological  applications  in  photovoltaics  and in thin film transistor arrays used  to  drive  liquid crystal displays (flat panel TV). However, the theoretical  understanding   of   a-Si:H  is  still  in  its   infancy.   This  experimental  research  is directed at  understanding  the  basic  electronic properties of defects in such materials. These defects  currently  limit  their  future  technological  exploitation.  Of  partic ular  interest are newly discovered aspects of  the  defect  behavior  in  a-Si:H  which  suggests  a  glassy  aspect  to  the  electronic structure itself. In addition, preliminary studies  of  the  electronic properties of a relatively new type of  amorphous  semiconductor,   tetrahedral  amorphous  carbon  (the   amorphous  counterpart of crystalline diamond) will be initiated.  ***",
