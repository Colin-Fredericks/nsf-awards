 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent theoretical developments in multi-unit demand (one sided)  auctions make it clear that uniform price auctions create an  incentive for demand reductions (bid shaving) resulting in  inefficient outcomes.  In contrast, extensions of the Vickrey  auction rule to multi-unit demand auctions promise, in theory, to  restore economic efficiency and to raise expected revenue  relative to uniform price auctions under a wide variety of  circumstances.  These predictions rest critically on bidders  recognizing and responding appropriately to the strategic  opportunities for demand reductions in uniform price auctions and  following a \"sincere\" bidding strategy in the Vickrey auctions.  The purpose of this research is to explore behavior in multi-unit  demand auctions through both theory and experiments.  The  experiments will focus on the extent to which bidders reduce  demand, and the resulting inefficiencies and revenue impact, in  uniform price auctions when bidders have equal and unequal  demands and with more or less intense competition.  Vickrey  auction experiments will focus on the effects of different  implementation rules for inducing sincere bidding using a  relatively transparent, open English clock auction procedure and  a sealed bid version of the clock procedure that may prove more  tractable in field settings.  Behavior will be studied in both  interactive and non-interactive (games against computerized  bidders) environments with the latter designed to eliminate the  \"noise\" associated with other players' actions on learning to  behave strategically.  Theoretical work will provide benchmark  models against which to evaluate the experimental outcomes and to  identify conditions where there are tradeoffs in theory, between  efficiency and revenue under the different auction institutions.    Work in multi-unit demand auctions is important because (i) most  auctions involve multi-unit demands and (ii) a number of insights  obtained from unit demand auctions fail to hold with multi-un it  demands. Many of these issues have come to the forefront-with the  design and implementation of the recent spectrum auctions.",
