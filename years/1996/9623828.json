 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to investigate protein-protein interactions   that occur during mammalian fertilization.  The ligand interactions that   occur upon binding of the sperm protein fertilin to the egg plasma   membrane, presumably at a receptor, will be dissected.   Specifically,   peptido-mimetics of the glutamate- cysteine-aspartate disintegrin loop   and the epidermal growth factor-like module of fertilin will be   synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit sperm-egg fusion.    Mutant peptides will be tested to identify residues important for   inhibition and good inhibitors will be developed into affinity labels.   These labels will be used to identify the receptor(s) in the egg-plasma   membrane.  Also, the domains of fertilin will be expressed using   recombinant DNA methodology and will be tested for their ability to   inhibit sperm-egg fusion.  The domains will be used as affinity ligands   for the isolation of their receptors and information about the structure   of the domains will be obtained with NMR spectroscopy.  Site-directed   mutagenesis experiments will identify residues important for binding,   fusion and signaling.  The educational plan will focus on undergraduate   course development and also on the development of a Ph.D. training   program at the interface of chemistry and biology.  With this CAREER   award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the research and   educational activities of Dr. Nicole S. Sampson of the Department of   Chemistry at SUNY, Stony Brook.   Professor Sampson will focus her   research efforts on investigating the protein-protein interactions that   occur during mammalian fertilization.   The benefit of the work lies in   the development of better, more specific contraceptives and in   discovering  the genetic reasons for infertility which could then be   circumvented.  The educational plan will focus on the development of an   undergraduate course on trends in biological chemistry and the the   construction of a teaching plan for a Ph.D. training program at the   interface of chemistry and biology.",
