Schmitt of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Instititution,   approximately 145 profiling P-ALACE (Profiling Autonomous Lagrangian And   Circulation Explorer) floats (at least half of them with salinity) will be   used to study specific water-mass transformation processes in the tropical and   subtropical Atlantic as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate   Experiment (ACCE).  The basin-wide grid will be used to provide relatively   uniform sampling to track upper layer salinity and heat content changes   throughout the basin.   Higher resolution arrays will be deployed in important   local regions where water masses such as the high-salinity Subtropical   Underwater (Leaman), relatively uniform 18-degree water (Riser) are formed or   transformed, or where important air-sea exchanges are highly variable such as   under the ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone) (R. Schmitt).  The higher-  resolution will allow tracking of seasonal and interannual changes in the   volume and structure of the upper ocean features, and relate these to   modeled/observed estimates of surface heat and fresh water fluxes.    Analysis of these data will provide time series of three-dimensional maps of   the velocity, temperature, and salinity fields within the upper 1500 m of the   tropical and subtropical gyres over the duration of the ACCE field experiment.    Additionally, statistical analyses will provide spatial distributions of mean   circulation and quantities like eddy kinetic and potential energies, and eddy   mixing, in addition to the flux estimates. These gyre-wide estimates will   provide strong constraints for the future climate models that must be   developed to adequately include the physics of the tropical and subtropical   Atlantic, particularly the fresh water budget.            9531869    Schmitt    In conjunction with companion projects by Drs.
