 "awd_abstract_narration": "9421657  Sidell  For approximately the last 40 million years, a unique fish fauna  has been evolving in the frigid seas surrounding Antarctica.   Physiological function of these water-breathing animals has  demanded many adaptations to ensure proper metabolism and  regulation of biochemical processes at cell temperatures of about  OoC.  Among the polar fishes, one family is particularly unusual,  the Channichthyid icefishes.  Species in this family lack  hemoglobin in their circulating blood and, at least the majority,  do not possess the intracellular respiratory protein, myoglobin,  that is normally responsible for enhancing movement of oxygen  through aerobic muscle tissues.  The PI's have recently  found  two species of icefish, Pseudochaenichthys georgianus and  Chionodraco rastrospinosus, however, that express myoglobin, but  only in one tissue - heart ventricle.  The metabolism of all  icefish species is highly aerobic and is based largely on the  combustion of fatty fuels as energy sources.  The field work will  consist of a combination of trawling from R/V Polar Duke to  capture icefish species and laboratory work at Palmer Station  using tissues from these animals.  At Palmer Station they will  conduct experiments and prepare purified, fixed and or frozen  material for shipment back to our CONUS laboratory for further  analyses.  Our overall goals are: 1) to test whether to determine  myoglobin protein remains physiologically significant at the cold  body temperatures of Antarctic fishes, 2) to reconstruct the  evolution of the myoglobin gene within the icefish family and, 3)  to identify the mechanisms controlling expression of myoglobin  within icefish and related species.",
