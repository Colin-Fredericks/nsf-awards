The  site will select a limited number of highly motivated and  talented undergraduates who can benefit from exposure to the  rich interdisciplinary mix of ideas at the Institute.  Women  and minorities will especially be invited to apply.  Senior  faculty mentors will be selected for their interest in the  program and each undergraduate will be matched with one or  more mentors who have research problems of real interest to  the student and to which the student can make a significant  contribution.  Other resident scientists will be encouraged  to take a regular interest in the intellectual development  of the interns.  The students will be encouraged to  participate fully in the intellectual life of the Institute  by attending colloquia and seminars and through informal  discussion of their work with other resident researchers.  Where appropriate, publication of scientific papers,  attendance at workshops, and release of student-developed  software will be encouraged by SFI.  During each student's  residency he will make a SFI colloquium presentation,  compile a written summary of his work, and frequently  consult with the program director.  Students are encouraged  to remain in contact with the Institute and their mentors as  their careers develop, and, if appropriate, to return for  subsequent scholarly visits.",
