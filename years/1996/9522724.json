 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS 95-22724   Higdon    The proposed work will address an important need for more information  concerning the dynamics of fluid interfaces and droplets.  There are numerous industrial applications that include distillation, liquid-solid extraction, drying, flow through packed beds and a variety of separation processes.   In general, multiphase   flows with fluid interfaces  and solid boundaries arise in a myriad of specific processes.  The proposed work   will provide a scientific basis for analyzing and controlling the dynamics of fluid interfaces across the full   range of applications.     The approach is a combined analytical/numerical treatment.  Four specific projects will be included in the   research program:     1. The stability of three dimensional drops attached to solid substrates will be studied using Boundary Element analysis combined with NewtonOs method.       2. Droplet displacement using acoustic excitation will be studied perturbation analysis in combination with the boundary element technique.     3. Strongly non-linear droplet oscillations will be studied utilizing a Galerkin/finite element  analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations.     4. droplet transport through capillaries and constrictions subject to strong acoustic forcing.  the final goal is to establish the mechanisms of enhanced transport rates that have been observed experimentally.",
