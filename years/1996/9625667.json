 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the design and implementation of  tools for interactive computer programming. The research  focuses on the creation of tools that furnish language-  specific, semantics-based, program manipulation operations.  The project investigates both, program slicing and partial  evaluation. In particular, the research studies (1) whether  techniques developed for one of the operations can be  applied to the other, and (2) whether the two operations can  be combined to support more powerful techniques for  manipulating programs.  The research focuses on two areas. The first is operations  for semantics-based program manipulation. Examples include  program specialization, symbolic composition, and program  generalization. The second is static analysis of programs.  Research is conducted on static analysis methods needed in  carrying out the above operations. Pointer analysis is of  particular importance. In both areas the scope of the work  includes development of theoretical foundations, algorithm  design, and system implementation. One testbed for the ideas  is the prototype C slicer, which currently is capable of  slicing large (22,000-line) programs.  ***",
