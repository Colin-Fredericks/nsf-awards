 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9625672  Huzurbazar    This research involves the application of flowgraph and saddlepoint  methods to problems in statistics with particular emphasis on prediction  in stochastic networks. Stochastic network models are of current interest   in statistics and can be applied to study a variety of natural phenomena.  Consider the progression of diseases such as kidney failure, cancer,  or AIDS. Of interest is the prediction of a survival time for a patient.  Survival times can be thought of as first passage times from one  state to another in a stochastic network so that prediction of a  survival time for a patient involves analysis of a complex stochastic  network. This research is concerned with such prediction.  Methodology is developed for computation of Bayesian  predictive distributions for stochastic networks in situations  involving a multitude of covariates and heavily censored data.   These methods are used in conjunction with generalized linear models   and proportional hazards models, so that predictive distributions as well as    predictive hazards and predictive survival functions for   first passage times between any two states of a disease, or more generally,  stochastic networks, are computed.   %%%   This is a study of flowgraphs which extends beyond   the natural emphasis area of  survival analysis  into several diverse areas of  engineering systems.  Flowgraphs were originally developed in the engineering sciences  to design and analyze complex systems. For example, these systems could be   descriptions of a manufacturing process, the reliability of  an artificial organ, or the predicted time to completion of a  building project. The analysis of flowgraphs traditionally has been  hampered by computational difficulties. Current engineering methods   involve time-consuming computer simulations. The computational  aspects of this research are based on saddlepoint approximations.  Saddlepoint approximations are high performance computationally intensive   techniques that provid e fast and accurate approximations to these problems.   The results developed here are applicable in the areas of reliability, and   industrial, electrical, and systems engineering, in addition to survival  analysis.  ***",
