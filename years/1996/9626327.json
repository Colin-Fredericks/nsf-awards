 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626327  Slattery       The investigator and colleagues organize the Second Magma  Conference on Computational Algebra.  In the past few years a  number of significant advances have taken place in several  different branches of computational algebra and number theory.  Because of the growing interdependence between the different  branches, an algorithmic advance in one area often has a major  impact on the performance of algorithms in other areas.  Consequently, the meeting brings together workers from some of the  key areas, including researchers working on software development  as well as those using these tools.  The conference is intended to  inform algorithm designers and users of recent developments in  cognate areas of computational algebra, number theory, and  geometry and inform key theoretical mathematicians of the  possibilities offered by the computational algebra tools that are  now becoming available.  It is also expected to identify desirable  algorithm and software developments that would result in  significant new applications in the near future.  The conference  promotes the use of the techniques of computational algebra in  application areas such as digital signal processing, complex  system design, network design, cryptography, coding theory and  applied combinatorics.       Algebra studies basic questions about discrete structure and  symmetry in the world.  Theoretical results from this branch of  mathematics help chemists understand the spectra of organic  molecules, physicists organize families of elementary particles,  and engineers solve systems of equations.  Algebraic invariants  are used to answer biochemists' questions about knotting in DNA  and anthropologists have even used algebraic classifications to  organize native artifacts in the southwestern U.S.  For many years  mathematicians have studied algebra with little more than their  imaginations and a pencil and paper.  But now, computers allow  researchers to work with larger and more complicated situations  tha n were possible in the past.  Computational algebra is the  general title given to these research efforts.  However, to use a  computer in mathematical research requires the development of  specialized software -- a task that can be time-consuming for the  typical researcher.  One way to address this need is through  systems such as Magma which provide easy access to  state-of-the-art algorithms in a number of fields of study.  Another important process is to encourage researchers to share  their experiences (and even software) through conferences such as  this; the interaction at a conference often leads to adaptation of  ideas and development of new directions.  These tools enable  theoretical researchers to explore more complicated situations, to  gain insight in unfamiliar settings, and to compute answers to  larger problems.  Computer-based work on primality testing and  factoring of large numbers is showing direct application to  cryptography and security.  Work in finite geometries and designs  are providing improved techniques for error-detection and data  compression.  These have a large impact on everyone's use of  computers and communications.",
