The hour format also will enable the producers to go into greater depth than was done in the daily coverage.  They will expand the news pieces with additional interviews and/or out-takes reporters were unable to use on the daily programs.  As part of the NPR outreach program, the project will develop  \"Weekly Science\" on \"Kids Connection (Science Friday)\" as part of the World Wide Web.  Each week, that week's program as well as additional science information and bibliographies will be entered on the \"Science Friday\" homepage.    The PI and executive producer for the series will be Anne Gudenkauf, Senior Editor at NPR.  Richard Harris and Joe Palca will host the series.  Harris has been an on-air host for NPR produced summaries of congressional action on health reform and both have substituted for Ira Flatow on NPR'S TALK OF THE NATION:  SCIENCE FRIDAY.  The program producer will be Jane Greenhalgh.",
