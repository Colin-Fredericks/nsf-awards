 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed effort is to develop and implement  a course in \"Information Engineering Across the Professions\"  which will be accessible to and relevant for students from  virtually any discipline.  This proposal addresses a need  that has arisen from the impact that information technology  is making on all professions, technical and non-technical.  This course will provide students with knowledge regarding  such concepts as the nature of information, bandwidth, types  of transmission and storage media, and the fundamental  principles governing information technology.  Through the  use of laboratory project-based \"personality modules\"  customized to address different student disciplinary  interests and backgrounds (e.g., mechanical engineering, the  sciences, the arts, management), the course will expose  students to professional applications of these technologies.    Given the range of topics, and the innovative means of  course delivery, it is reasonable to expect that the  proposed course will prove attractive to a significant  number of students (including women and under-represented  groups) who are not typically drawn to engineering.    The specific result of this project will be one course,  offered twice per academic year.  A substantial evaluation  plan has been developed.  Regarding dissemination, beyond  the traditional methods, a broad range of course resources  will be available for downloading and customization via the  World Wide Web.",
