 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622779  Wright   This award provides funding to create Agent-Based Manufacturing Systems.   The key feature is that manufacturing software \"agents\" will be created to enhance precision and production speed. Today, a vast number of software packages for engineering design, analysis, planning and fabrication are available on the Internet. However, they exist in a heterogeneous distributed system, usually with no well-characterized link to an individual designer. For example, such remote services might be configured for one commercial CAD system while the individual designer is working on another. Or, the service might be a specialized manufacturing facility, that the designer would like to \"query and get information about\". The first research task will create a standard \"wrapper\" for such services, employing common languages, representations and   interconnections. The second task will create a collaborative environment so that all points-of-view are brought into the design.  The third task will create methods to satisfy trade-offs and resolve conflicts.     If successful, this research will enable US manufacturers to produce at low cost while addressing the stringent constraints on dimension, form, surface finish and part integrity. As one example, previous research at Berkeley created an integrated CAD/CAM system for the production of injection molds used in the consumer electronics industry. With \"agent-based manufacturing\", one agent will advise on how to obtain the best surface finish inside the injection molds, and another agent will compensate for tooling deflections, thus creating more accurate components. Agents will extract the knowledge that is now distributed on the Internet and incorporate it into design and planning. This will avoid ambiguities and mistakes during manufacturing, thus improving production.",
