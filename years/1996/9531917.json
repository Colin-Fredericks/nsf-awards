 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract of the project (item C)                The principal investigator will continue to study the internal  structure theory of subnormal operators, with particular consideration  of finite rank self-commutator, the structure of invariant subspaces,  and connections and applications to other fields. He will use operator  theoretical tools to study the theory of quadrature domains. He also plans  to investigate the structure of invariant subspaces of the Bergman space  on the unit disk and multipliers between the Bergman spaces over a  general bounded region.              Operator theory is a central discipline in modern mathematics that  studies infinite dimensional generalization of matrices. This type of  research is an attempt to classify operators satisfying additional  conditions given in terms of the associated operator or the   underlying space.  They have rich applications in every applied science   as well as pure mathematics. To mention a specific example, one of   basic H-infinity control problems was developed by the classical   mathematical theory of Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation. Applications of   the theory include improvement in automobile suspension systems,   airplane flight control, chemical process control, etc.",
