 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634849  Hearn   This project involves modeling and analysis of congested networks.  Congested networks are encountered in a variety of scenarios, including vehicular traffic flow, routing of calls in telecommunications systems, natural gas distribution, water distribution.  The research is concerned with two distinct problems:  (1) optimal toll pricing in congested networks, and (2)  determination of flows in bounded congested network flow models.  The investigators will develop algorithms to efficiently solve these problems and will carry out a large-scale numerical implementation of the approaches developed in the research.  In the case of congestion toll pricing,  these algorithms will be based on an existing two-stage approach for determining tolls known as MINSYS.  New research will focus on efficient specialized methods to exploit the network structure of the problem, and extensions to the case where the system objective function is convex but each of the components of the cost map is concave.  In the case of bounded networks, these algorithms will represent enhancements to the principal investigator's non-linear, multicommodity congestion network code, which uses the affine scaling with centering bundle method (ASCBM).  In particular, the method will be extended to handle non-differentiable objective functions and ill-conditioned problems.       Pricing of tolls on congested networks to guarantee that the \"user\" equilibrium is close to the \"system\" equilibrium is a problem faced by organizations as diverse as city traffic planners and telecommunications engineers.  The theory and algorithms developed in this research have great promise to improve planning and decision-making functions in these networks.  Moreover, the research should open up new avenues for the analysis of  network flows in general.",
