 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531696  Hull    This research project aims, through combined experimental and theoretical work, for  development of a process simulator for energetic, kinetic and electronic descriptions of  misfit dislocations in strained layer semiconductor epitaxy. The primary goals of the  program are to: provide a coherent framework and a repository for experimental data relati  ng to misfit dislocations in strained layer epitaxy; incorporate mechanistic understanding  of the different processes involved in plastic relaxation in strained layer epitaxy, and to  combine this with experimental descriptions of these processes to enable predictive  simulation of the extent of plastic relaxation as a function of thermal history du  ring growth, annealing and materials processing; and to define quantitative relationships  between the structure/density of misfit dislocation arrays and their electronic properties,  and incorporate these relationships into the process simulator to allow modeling of device  ramifications of plastic relaxation. The approach to these goals includes: a  ddressing shortcomings in experimental descriptions of kinetic processes in plastic  relaxation, especially the dislocation nucleation process; to quantitatively determine the  effects of critical materials processing steps--implantation and  activation/metallization/oxidation) upon plastic relaxation; to correlate misfit  dislocation structure and densities with their effect on electronic properties of the host  structure, and, to investigate the effects of device operation on the dislocation  microstructure, and appropriate software development. The intent is to develop this concept  such that at the conclusion of the program, the simulator will be available for general  distribution within the scientific community.  %%%  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at the fundamental atomic  level of technological relevance to several aspects of advanced microelectronic devices and  integrated circuitry. Additional ly, the knowledge and understanding gained from this  research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the perfor  mance of advanced devices and circuits used in computing, information processing, and  telecommunications by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and  producing improved materials. An important feature of the program is the integration of  research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and techno  logically significant area.  ***  _",
