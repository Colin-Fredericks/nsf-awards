 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major research area, one evolving out of the principal investigator's long-term  work in nonlinear circuit theory, is the development of a rigorous stability  theory for the operating points of dc transistor circuits.  A complete solution  (necessary and sufficient conditions for dc operating point stability in  nonlinear circuits) seems almost within grasp, and this research project seeks  to obtain it.  Research on low-power circuits encompasses the design of new low-  power clock buffers, schemes for implementing circuits to achieve charge recovery  on a databus and the investigation of techniques for the design of low-power  practical circuits such as Viterbi decoders for CDMA digital cellular  applications.    Another project concerns the development of new techniques for multiplierless  digital filter design, including the design of novel multiplierless adaptive  filters.  Work will continue on new techniques for IIR filter pipelining, a topic  that shows great promise in providing more economical structures (in terms of  lower power-dissipation and IC-area requirements) for DSP systems.  In addition,  research will continue in the area of video compression, where a technique for  rate-distortion optimization is being developed.  Finally, recent circuit design  experience has made evident the need for advances in logic simulation.  The  principal investigator's research has already produced several simple ways to  improve simulation efficiency and it is expected that major improvements will be  forthcoming through further vigorous pursuit of this project",
