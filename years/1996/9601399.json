 "awd_abstract_narration": "Questions  of chemical reactivity can often be cast as  questions  of  molecular geometry. In particular, space filling  models  are  often  invoked to rationalize the chemical behavior of  proteins.  Some of the physio-chemical properties which have been treated by  geometric  methods include: packing density, folding  energetics,  and molecular recognition.    New  methods  are  presented - based  on  the  idea  of  the  ray  representation - for manipulating molecular shapes and  computing  their  geometric  properties.  The ray  representation  formalism  provides  a  unified  means of dealing with geometric  issues  in  molecular modeling. Computation of ray-representations for use in  molecular analysis were initially accomplished on special purpose  computers in the Principal Investigator's laboratory. However  it  has  been  recently shown that molecular ray-reps can be computed  with  high  speed  on general purpose single and  multi-processor  work-stations.    The   proposed   work  will  further  develop  ray-representation  techniques  for  the  study of proteins structure  and  function.  Three   separate  areas  of  research  will  be  pursued.  First,  algorithmic  enhancements to rayrepresentation calculations  will  be  studied.  There will be particular focus on  improvements  in  accuracy  and  speed. General purpose tools based on  ray-casting  algorithms  will  be  developed for use  in  molecular  modeling.  Second, working with ray-representations, the details of building  space-filling   models  for  predictive   analysis   of   protein  physio-chemical properties will be studied. In particular, models  will  be  calibrated with respect to prediction of water  bearing  cavities  and surface solvation potentials. A survey  of  protein  packing  properties  based  on  high  resolution  data  will   be  undertaken. Third, simulations will consider the role  of  cavity  dynamics in protein ligand uptake.",
