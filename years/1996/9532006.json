To this end the PI will work interactively  with members of the NCAR group on questions of transport  parameterization and sub-grid scale processes, flight planning and  sampling strategy, and the application of the results.  There are  also two secondary objectives: First in cooperation with Dr. Pieter  Tans (NOAA/CMDL) Boulder) to acquire simultaneous CO, CO2, CH4  Measurements in the course of those flights, for use in model  validation and to further our understanding of the global carbon  budget.  Second, by concentrating the flights in one season, to  acquire a data set which will be useful in the development and  validation of other regional and global models as well, such as 3-D  GCM-based climate and chemical transport models.    Measurements will be made aboard a NASA Lear 24 jet aircraft flying  in the central and western United States, using a fast sampling  system which the PI has flown aboard NASA C-141 and C-130 aircraft.   The flight series will consist of five round trip flights between  Moffett Field, CA and Minneapolis, MN (with a refueling stop in  Colorado) and five local (offshore) flights out of Moffett Field,  to be flown over a five week period in the summer of 1996.  The  sampling strategy for both the outbound and return flight will be  similar, with vertical profiles obtained over specified locations  in Colorado and Minnesota, and upper level observations made in the  course of the flight legs between Moffett, Colorado and Minnesota  locations.  Present plans call for the outbound legs to be fl own on  Tuesdays of the five successive weeks, and the returns on Thursday  or Friday; however there is enough flexibility in the timing of the  outbound and return legs to avoid possible problems due to  aliasing, or recurrent synoptic situations.  Vertical profiles in  the vicinity of Moffett, and 200 miles offshore will be acquired on  each of the offshore flights, to investigate modeling artifacts  associated with boundary layer parameterization and continental  edge effects.    The PI will work with NCAR and other interested modeling groups in  the application of the radon data, and with NOAA and others on the  application of the trace constituent data set.  The radon results  will be archived and made available via anonymous ftp and \"3.5  floppy discs.    This research is important because it will provide valuable  observations that are needed to test and evaluate atmospheric  general circulation models that are being developed to include  chemistry processes.",
