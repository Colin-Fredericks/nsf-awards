The building will provide state-of-the-art, environmentally-friendly, earthquake-proof, climate-controlled space for its collections and research library, as well as offices for researchers.  The herbarium room in this new building will provide compactorized storage for approximately one-half of the Garden's 4.3 million specimens (the remainder will continue to occupy the current herbarium building).  This award represents 50% of the purchase price of the compactor carriages and shelving for the herbarium room; the other 50% will be matched by the Garden in partnership with NSF.  The building will be completed in 1998, and the compactors installed and filled shortly thereafter.",
