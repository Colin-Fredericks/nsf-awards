 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract   Yang  9532033      The proposed will develop harmonic analysis methods to solve   a number of nonlinear evolution equations including the nonlinear   Schrodinger equation, the nonlinear wave equation, the modified   Korteweg-de Vries equation, the Zakharov systems and a fourth order   elliptic equation arising in conformal geometry. In the analysis of   the relevant integral operators, harmonic analysis estimates will  be used to analyze the oscillatory kernels. The known body of results   concerning these equation deal mainly with the equation in the whole   space.  New ideas and techniques will be needed to handle the problem   on domains with boundary. The fourth order equation will require  an understanding of the Sobolev inequalities for higher order derivatives.   In particular, a search for analogue of the positive mass theorem  is required.       All of the evolution equations mentioned above represent various  models in materials science and fluid mechanics. For example, the   collective response of a nearly collisionless plasma when the electron   temperature is much greater than the ion temperature is dominated by   electron plasma waves (Langmuir waves) and ion acoustic waves. Under   appropriate conditions (energy density of the waves small compared to   particle thermal energy densities, and characteristic scales large   compared to a Debye length), Zakharov's model is a useful description   of the nonlinear coupling of these collective models. Schrodinger   equation can be understood as a limit case of Zakharov's model and can   also be used to describe in certain regimes the Langmuir waves in a   plasma, i.e., the time evolution of the envelope of the propagating   electric field. Our main project is to analyze the solutions of the   equations by using the tools of harmonic analysis. For example, we want   to understand the development of singularity at certain time, which   represents, in the Schrodinger models, how the Langmuir waves collapse.   This typical proble m is understood when the models are on the whole   physical space. Part of our work is to study the situation when the   models are confined in a bounded region in the physical space. The   other project we are working on is to study a non-linear problem  in geometry. Here we are looking for a conserved quantity analogous to   the total mass of a gravitational systems which will play an important   role to the solvability of the equation.",
