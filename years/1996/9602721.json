 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies  is a marine laboratory operated by San Francisco State University.  The Center is the only academic research facility on San Francisco Bay, and one of the largest estuaries in the United States. Primarily a graduate facility, the Center's research mission is aimed toward a fundamental understanding of the physical and biological processes of the San Francisco Bay and its surrounding environments.   Current research projects, being conducted by  the Center's eleven senior research scientists, range from detoxification mechanisms of estuarine invertebrates to studies of bacterioplankton in Antarctica.   Presently research is conducted in the main laboratory of Building 36 that was constructed approximately 50 years ago.  The antiquated infrastructure is so deficient that  the laboratory cannot adequately support research and research training activities.  To rectify the inadequacies, the Center  will embark upon a renovation project to modernize the facility.   In order to accomplish this  goal, funding from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program, combined with resources from the San Francisco State University, will be used to carry out a comprehensive renovation of the Center.  Specifically, NSF funds will be used for Phase I of the project  that entails  the complete renovation of the first floor. General refurbishments  will consist of:  upgrading  the physical plant, improving vertical circulation, and bringing  the facility  in compliance with safety and ADA regulations.   Enhancements  to individual research laboratories  will include utility upgrades,  improved emergency egress, and the installation of new counters  and fixed equipment.  Upon completion, the new facility will enable scientists to conduct  state-of-the-art research, and promote the growth of the Center into a leading environmental and educational institution.  Modernized facilities will allow researchers  at the Tiburon Center to continue their work on the complex biological, chemical, and physical environments of estuaries,  and will serve to help ensure the future recruitment of quality senior staff and students.",
