 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Konkowski will continue and extend her previous  work on spacetimes with mild singularities.  Mild  singularities include quasiregular and nonscalar curvature  singularities.  In the case of quasiregular singularities,  particle paths end suddenly with no warning from infinitely-  increasing tidal forces, while in the case of nonscalar  curvature singularities some, but not all, particles moving  near the singularity feel infinite tidal forces.  A study  has already begun of a spacetime with a quasiregular  singularity which can be approached only by an incomplete  curve of bounded acceleration.  This investigation will be  continued using classical and quantum fields and  applications of the singularity conjecture.  In addition,  spacetimes with mild singularities due to Siklos and to  Gurses and Sermutlu will be studied.  The rather than Ricci  curvature singularities, which are likely to provide more  stringent limits on the validity of the conjectures.  Most  of the stability tests have involved classical field  techniques.  She will now extend the tests to include the  behavior of quantum particles and fields near mild  singularities and Cauchy horizons.  It will be interesting,  for example, to examine the behavior of a particle wave  packet as it approaches a mild singularity or a Cauchy  horizon to study the effects of barrier penetration.  It  will also be interesting to broaden the stability  conjectures to include the behavior of quantum test-fields  near singularities and Cauchy horizons.",
