 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Meek will explore the role of serum estrogen and neural estrogen receptors in the control of behavioral receptivity in the female meadow vole, a species without a regular, cyclic estrus.  Female meadow voles appear to have several different mating strategies (associated with different latencies to begin mating), which result in differential fertility.  Specifically, Dr. Meek will (1) determine if serum estrogen is correlated with the onset of behavioral receptivity in female meadow voles; (2) determine if there is a differential sensitivity to the behavioral effects of estrogen among female meadow voles with different latencies to begin mating, and (3) determine if there is a difference in the number, location, and/or intensity of staining of estrogen-receptor-immunoreactive cells among female meadow voles with different latencies to begin mating.  These preliminary experiments should lead to an exploration of GnRH immunoreactivity (GnRH-IR) in the brains of unmated and mated female voles that have different mating latencies, and which are housed in photoperiods simulating either summer (long daylengths, LD) or winter (short daylengths, SD).  An exploration of location, number and staining intensity of GnRH-IR cells in ovulating (LD) and non-ovulating (SD late-mating) meadow voles may provide information about how GnRH controls ovulation.  Since the neuroendocrine events leading to fertility are similar in all female mammals, it is possible that these experiments may lead to a greater understanding of how fertility can be suppressed or enhanced in other species, including humans, via similar mechanisms.",
