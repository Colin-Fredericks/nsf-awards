 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is addressing the lack of participation in science, engineering, and math endeavors  by rural middle school girls, and should serve as a model for programs in rural settings  throughout the nation.    It will provide rural Mississippi girls with hands-on experiences with computer hardware and  software, a nurturing environmental in which to build problem-solving skills, a network of other  girls interested in SEM studies, and exposure to a variety of female role models who are  pursuing SEM careers.  Program activities feature an intensive weeklong stay on the University  of Mississippi campus; monthly programs at the girls  schools continuing through the school  year; electronic mentoring form university women in computer science, and a capstone weekend  back on campus.  A complementary program for teachers will emphasize the need for gender  equity in science and math teaching; and establishing a support network of middle school  teachers and university faculty committed to inspiring girls to succeed at SEM    Major program goals are that:  participants will understand SEM concepts, and develop  improved critical thinking abilities and problem-solving skills through cooperative, discovery-  oriented activities, participants will gain self confidence in their science and mathematics abilities  and their overall competence, participants will be motivated to participate fully in science,  engineering and mathematics education and to consider SEM careers, and teachers will develop  contacts, and revitalize and recommit their efforts to promote gender equity in SEM at their  schools    Significant spill-over effects should be expected on other groups:  teachers who participate along  with the girls; families of girls involved in the program, and other girls at the participating  schools.",
