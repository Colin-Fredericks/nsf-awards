 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigation of the diffusion of small, atmospherically relevant   molecules on and in ice is the subject of this research project supported   jointly by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the   Atmospheric Chemistry Program.  Laser resonant desorption methods will be   used to probe the diffusion of ClONO2, HOCl, HNO3 and HCl on the surface   and in the bulk of ice and acid hydrate multilayers produced and   characterized in an ultra high vacuum apparatus.  An understanding of the   diffusion process and a knowledge of diffusion rates is important to   developing an understanding of the heterogeneous chemistry of polar   stratospheric clouds that convert stable halogen containing reservoir   molecules into active halogen species which destroy ozone catalytically   in the stratosphere.  This work will also provide new basic information   about the diffusion process on and in molecular solids.  In order to understand the detailed mechanisms and rates of stratospheric   ozone depletion by man made chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbon   propellants and refrigerants, it is important to know about the rates and   mechanisms of diffusion of these molecules and their decomposition   products on the surfaces and in the bulk of the ice particles which exist   in the stratosphere.  Obtaining this understanding is the goal of this   research project.  Using laser desorption methods developed previously by   the principal investigator, the details of this diffusion process will be   examined.  This information will help in developing models of the   chemistry of the atmosphere which will aid scientists in proposing   solutions for problems such as the depletion of the ozone layer in the   stratosphere.",
