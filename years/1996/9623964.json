The anticipated results of this investigation include: (1) Greater understanding of the physical properties that lead to superior noise and high frequency performance and (2) Development of practical design models for the optimization and implementation of critical circuit components.    This research will lead to an improved fundamental understanding of the role of coherent transport and noise mechanisms in advanced transistor structures.  Based on this effort, significant impact is expected upon the development of robust device design models for wireless applications between 1 and 100 Ghz.  This research will provide improved device small-signal and large-signal models, enhanced frequency dependent noise models, development of CAD models in an industry standard format and practical demonstration of the impact of high performance, wide bandwidth electrical components.  This work also has the potential for commercialization of:  the experimental techniques, enhanced CAD models, and improved integration techniques for InP based transistor and circuit processes.  Most importantly, the proposed research tasks represent collaborative efforts with leading industrial and academic laboratories which provide a direct path for commercialization and manufacturing.    My teaching plan during the CAREER award period addresses the education of students from grade school to graduate school.  I have a strong interest  in developing talented students and giving opportunities to students who traditionally may have been left out of graduate studies in electrical engineering.  I would like to continue to involve students in meaningful design project both in the classroom and the laboratory.  I believe it is critical that the students receive a \"real-world\" educational experience which should  prove most rewarding in their future careers.  ***",
