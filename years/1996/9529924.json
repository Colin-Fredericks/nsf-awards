 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many U.S. companies implement activities known as high performance process management, or HPPM.  Under HPPM, companies strive for extraordinary levels of product quality, great process efficiency, intensive process control, and very rapid response.  The desired effect is a dramatic increase in customer satisfaction and financial returns.  The agenda is augmented by improved vendor relations, increased employee involvement, and more rational product and process design.  While HPPM can deliver results, its implementation is difficult and failures do occur.  This project is a field study of the strengths and weaknesses of HPPM implementation at four companies.  The research will be interdisciplinary, involving both industrial and systems engineering expertise (including statistical analysis, process mapping, and control theory), and social science based organizational design and management of change frameworks (including organizational diagnosis and surveys, and anthropological field techniques).  The project engages the organizational partners in both design and execution of the research.  Expected results include an identification of generic HPPM implementation success factors and barriers, discovery of mismatches between current academic research on process management/engineering and actual industry needs, and recommendations for changes in how process management/engineering is taught in universities.",
