 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625004  Pines  This is a Faculty Early Career Develop (CAREER) award.  The  project involves integrating  research and education to advance  the technology of  smart materials and structures and techniques  to remotely monitor damage in large civil structures.  The  research focuses on the development of a smart civil structure  with embedded piezoelectric sensors for inferring structural  damage.  The research will emphasize the integration of embedded  sensors, actuators and processors into load carrying members of  large civil structures for the purpose of remote damage  detection.  Throughout the course of the research, analytical and  experimental results will be incorporated into the Clark School  of Engineering interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate  curriculum which includes courses on structural dynamics, smart  structures, earthquake engineering and nondestructive evaluation.  The goal is to develop a parallel approach that bridges the gap  between theory and reality.  Students will be involved at all  levels of the program, including analysis, design, construction  and the dissemination of results.  ***",
