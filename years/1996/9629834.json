 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zellner  9629834       the investigator and colleagues organize a workshop on  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques.  These techniques,  originally developed in mathematics and physics, have come to be  of great importance in many sciences and fields of application.  Their use allows researchers and applied workers to solve many  theoretical and applied  problems.  While MCMC techniques have  already been shown to be of great value, more work has to be done  to improve them.  For example, new methods are being developed to  speed convergence of MCMC techniques, to check on the convergence  and accuracy of MCMC output, and to provide computer systems and  programs needed to implement MCMC techniques in a user-friendly,  interactive environment.  These are a subset of the topics,  including new applications, that are discussed at the workshop.       the investigator and colleagues organize a workshop on  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques.  Monte Carlo  techniques are ways to make probabilistic estimates of  quantities.  For example, the volumes of a complicated shape can  be estimated by making random samples of the shape when embedded  in a simpler shape.  MCMC techniques have already been of great  value in solving important problems in science, industry and  government.  In this connection, models are employed to explain  past behavior, predict future outcomes and evaluate proposed  policies.  Deriving good solutions involves needed calculations  that are best carried out by use of MCMC techniques in many  instances, e.g. in connection with the analysis of global  warming, financial asset-pricing, industry personnel decisions,  on-line quality control and governmental policy problems.  Better  MCMC techniques, and more informed users of them, contribute to  better solutions to these and other private and public scientific  and policy problems.",
