 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624578  Durlach     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project will focus concurrently on  developing   Visual Performance Instruments (VPIs) that enables the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing to perform in a medium   that serves as a visual analog of music, algorithms to process digitally sampled acoustic music and cause   VPIs to dance in accompaniment, and closely related science museum and commercial advertising displays   that utilize the same underlying hardware and software control environments. Phase II objectives include:   -The creation of a working prototype for a new VPI called the Tower of Triangles (TOT). TOT is made out   of mirrored triangular columns which function as linear torsional wave-mediums for small excitation energies   and chaotic systems for high-excitation energies, and may be \"played\" in real-time via a computer-mediated   user interface. -Adding the ability, in an existing performance artwork constructed out of iron dust in a   computer-controlled electromagnetic field, to dance automatically in response to music. The Phase II tasks   for implementing this system include the further development of an algorithm for extracting rhythmic   information from music in real-time, and software physics simulations whose initial conditions and   evolution parameters are modified in real-time by data extracted from the music. -The creation of a set of   computer-controlled turntables which function both as the drive mechanism for the first VPI mentioned above,   and collectively in their own right as a display device to animate, in sophisticated and complex ways, retail   point-of-purchase products and trade-show exhibit items.   Commercial applications of the science/artworks, VPIs and automatic music response control   software include: VPIs for the deaf, responsive dancing corporate logos for trade-show; retail store, and   nightclub environments; interactive science museum exhibits on wave mediums and chaotic systems;   kinetic signs for commercial use; an interactiv e option for coin-operated dancing artwork displays.",
