The funds requested are to support primarily Ms. Laurie Raymundo, a Ph.D. student whose project involves developing optimal procedures for coral reef seed transplantation, survival and growth, and recruitment and colonization on bare substrates in the Philippines.  Silliman University in the Philippines will provide the logistical support for this project.  Coral reefs are important to coastal productivity, but susceptible to damage from human activity.  The extent of coral reef degradation throughout Southeast Asia has accelerated throughout the past 20 years.  The goal of this project is to test two methods for coral transplantation as a means of accelerating restoration of coral reefs.  The results can provide the basis for new and improved technology.  It can also help coral reef ecologists and related scientists in the U.S. and the Philippines to better understand how coral reefs regenerate.        @                                     Oh     +'  0                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       ABSTRACT                            Arletha Mayfield                    Arletha Mayfield            @                                   @                                   @                                                                           a                               @    F #                                    Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      3                                                                                       ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         e =       e               6                       6                                       p       p   p       p       p       p       p                                                                           Q                                                                   0       2       2       2       Q       m                   T   L   <                           p                                                                                          p       p                                                                       p               p               0                                       p       p       p       p               0                                                                                                                                   9512721 Harvell   This is a three year dissertation enhancement award proposed by Dr. Drew Harvell and Ms. Laurie Raymundo, Cornell  University.
