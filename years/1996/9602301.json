 "awd_abstract_narration": "Saint Joseph College, located in Connecticut, was founded in 1932 to assist women in obtaining higher education.  Constructed in 1936, McDonough Hall, home to Department of Natural Sciences, remains as initially constructed without any modifications.  Dedicated research and research training facilities are unavailable for faculty and students to pursue their research interests.  ARI funds will be used to convert an outdated laboratory into a modern undergraduate research and research training facility for students in Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. An existing instrumentation room will be remodeled and reconfigured to accommodate additional research equipment.  Current spaces used for research and training activities will be relocated and consolidated in the new laboratories. Renovations will include the demolition and removal of all existing benches, fume hoods, sinks, and lighting, and the installation of new plumbing, ventilation, fume hoods, and other fixed equipment.  Interactive space designed for cooperative research will enhance discussions and facilitate multidisciplinary research among students and faculty. Both labs will be in compliance with ADA and safety regulations. It is anticipated that more students will be exposed to science as they see firsthand research being conducted in the renovated space.  Upon completion, it is projected that the number of students that can be accommodated in the new labs will increase three-fold. This project is integral to the Department's efforts in delivering a quality undergraduate research program, and will have a significant impact on the undergraduate research experience at  St. Joseph College.",
