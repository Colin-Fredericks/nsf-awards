 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513093  Ishii    This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists  in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Two-Phase flow Dynamics, to be  held in Fukuoka, Japan, from July 7-13, 1996.  The co-  organizers are Professor Mamoru Ishii of Purdue University  and Professor Tohru Fukano of Kyushu University.  The main  objective of this seminar is to bring together highly  qualified researchers with common interests for intensive  and detailed exchanges of information about their current  and future research in the field of two-phase flow.  Collectively, the research pursued by the seminar  participants has the potential to: improve instrumentation  methods, develop reliable constitutive relations, and obtain  a better understanding of detailed two-phase flow phenomena.  The major objectives of the seminar are to: 1) develop  general directions for research; 2) focus future research  with regard to the recent significant developments in  instrumentation technology; and 3) discuss best approaches  for the fully three-dimensional two-phase flow model.  The  seminar should contribute greatly to the sustained rapid  progress in two-phase flow dynamics during the coming  decade.  ***",
