 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to extend a comparative  empirical and theoretical study of the nature, implications, and  decline of a non-market economic institutions that supported  anonymous markets for goods characterized by distance in time and  place such as credit markets and contracts for future delivery.  This research consists of two separate but related projects.    The first is an empirical and theoretical examination of the  relations between political institutions, coercive power, and  commercial development during the late medieval Commercial  Revolution.  Specifically, these relations will be examined in  the context of late medieval Genoa, the second largest maritime  Italian city-state during that period.  The extent to which the  potential use of military power hindered the ability of feudal  lords, who established the Commune of Genoa, to cooperate will be  analyzed.  Further, the extent to which political institutions  hindered or fostered such cooperation will be examined.    The second project will examine the economic implications of the  ability of social groups (such as clans, tribe, and ethnic  groups) to invest economic resources in military strength and use  this ability to expropriate wealth from other groups.  In this  context, the conditions will be explored under which a state with  the ability to predate and demand taxes can promote economic  welfare, and the conditions under which economic welfare is not  hindered due to the absence of a state with such attributes.   This analysis will combine the two prevailing views of the state.  Namely, the state as reflecting a social contract and the state  as dictator with limited coercive power.  A game theoretical  framework will allow the explicit modeling of self-enforcing  contractual relations.   It is expected that this analysis will  provide the foundation for future empirical research into the  nature of the state and the economic experience of economies in  pre-modern Europe and contemporary Africa.",
