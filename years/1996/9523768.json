This will  be the 30th meeting of the former conference and the seventh  meeting of the latter conference.  There will be a mix of one-hour  and half-hour invited talks and contributed talks in areas ranging  from general/set theoretic topology through continuum theory and  dynamical systems to geometric topology.       The Spring Topology Conference has long established itself as  one of the largest and most successful annual topology conferences  in the U.S.  Over the years, this conference has managed to  maintain its traditional identity and at the same time to expand  its breadth.  In particular, the area of dynamical systems was  integrated into the conference in 1987, and its evolving link to  the more traditional areas of topology has become a central  emphasis of the conference.  ***",
