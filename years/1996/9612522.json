 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612522  Wilson  In this research, we develop a design framework of novel signal processing hierarchies   and architectures for distributed sensing systems.  We propose to explore a design   methodology that combines analog VLSI for customizing front-end signal processing on   the sensing plane with generic processing centers located off the sensing plane for   performing back-end processing directed toward more complex feature analysis.  We seek   to apply these distributed signal processing architectures to arrays of sensors that are   distributed within and fused across various sensing planes.  These sensing planes may be   of the same type of sensor but placed at different locations in the sensing environment.    Alternatively, different types of sensing planes can be fused for more accurate recognition   and confirmation of objects of interest.  The applications of distributed systems of this   type of architecture are numerous and diverse.  The phase of research proposed here does   not seek to build systems that satisfy all of these applications nor even systems for a   substantial subset of these applications.  Rather, this research develops a framework for   building and testing novel architectures to be applied to the longer-term design of  low-  cost, distributed sensing systems that have the capability to process large numbers of   sensing stations and sensory points in a variety of environments.  ***",
