 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to provide funding for equipment to update molecular biology laboratory courses. The proposed project  is also expected to improve other courses using molecular-based techniques, the ability to introduce molecular-based concepts and experimentation to biology majors and nonmajors, and the training of future elementary science teachers.  Pedagogic issues addressed by the updated laboratory courses include learning essential techniques of molecular biology, introducing the scientific method of doing research,  and learning how to write scientifically and effectively.  In particular, students will be introduced to important molecular techniques, such as preparing recombinant DNA plasmids, DNA analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques and sequencing, and  analyses of protein expression. Other innovative aspects of the project include an emphasis on a research-like laboratory experience and an increased use of computers to enhance learning. The use of this equipment is also being integrated into a new Education/Natural Science major that utilizes novel, inquiry-based techniques to train the next generation of elementary science teachers.",
