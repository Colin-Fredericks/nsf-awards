As one of the perceived last  pristine regions on Earth, Antarctica has attracted  substantial interest from the public in preserving and  protecting its innate values and natural resources.    The primary international mechanism for addressing  environmental issues in Antarctica is through the Antarctic  Treaty System.  In 1994, the Antarctic Treaty Consultative  Meeting  requested that the Scientific Committee on  Antarctic Research and the Council of Operations Managers of  National Antarctic Programs jointly convene technical  workshops to provide expert advice on the design  and  implementation of environmental monitoring programs.   In  response to this, an organizing committee was formed and two  workshops will be held; the first in Oslo, Norway and the  second in College Station, Texas. These international  workshops will address a wide range of issues related to the  development, design and implementation of a simple,  realistic and effective continent-wide network of monitoring  programs to gauge resource deterioration. To ensure the  success of the deliberations a broad cross-section of  experienced Antarctic practitioners (scientists,  technologists, national operators, and policy  makers) are  being encouraged to attend. This award provides partial  support for travel to both workshops and partial support to  support the second workshop to be held at Texas A&M  University.",
