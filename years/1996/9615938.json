 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615938  Wood  The goal of this proposed research is to investigate  the use of the Hok killer peptide as a completely new  antibiotic and antiviral system.  The potential  efficacy of the Hok peptide as a broad, non-specific,  antiparasitic drug will be determined by testing its  activity against relevant bacteria, fungi, and phage.   This research highly novel and exploratory since the  extracellular antibiotic application of Hok peptide is  largely untested.  However, the antibiotic idea is  sound since almost all bacteria tested to date are  susceptible to killing by Hok when it is expressed  intracellularly, and the PI has recently shown that  phage T4 (a virus that destroys bacteria) can be  excluded when the Hok protein is expressed in E. coli  cells.  In order to investigate the broad range  effectiveness against human pathogens, the Hok peptide  will be overexpressed using recombinant bacteria,  purified using gel filtration and reverse-phase, high-  performance-liquid chromatography, and identified  through fast-atom-bombardment mass spectroscopy.  Using  the purified peptide, antimicrobial assays will be  performed to determine if the peptide is capable of  slowing or preventing bacterial and fungal growth.  To  thwart the propagation of virus in animal cells in a  manner analogous to how the Hok protein excludes T4  phage by killing the host before the virus can  propagate, a general suicide system for animal cells  will be developed to combat virus-based diseases.  This  will require controllable expression of a killer  protein nd activity in a wide variety of animal cells.   Initially, the ability of Hok to kill insect cells (as  representative animal cells) will be evaluated by using  the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 for Hok  expression in insect cells under the polyhedrin  promoter.  ***",
