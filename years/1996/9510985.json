 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formulating effective social policy requires careful analysis of  the intertemporal decisions that individuals make.  For example,  responding to social problems like drug use, criminal activity,  teenage pregnancy, and high-school failure, requires  understanding of the intertemporal decisions that contribute to  these outcomes.  Enhancing the understanding of intertemporal  choices is the focus of this study.  It will emphasize  interdisciplinary research projects motivated by behavioral  anomalies in intertemporal decision-making.  Each project  analyzes a new model of intertemporal choice suggested by  evidence and experiments in the psychology literature.  These  psychological models will be evaluated using standard economic  analysis.    This study involves three different research projects.  The first  project analyzes the behavior of decision-makers with hyperbolic  discount functions.  Hyperbolic discount functions suggest a  multiple-self interpretation of intertemporal decision-making,  generating an interesting framework for understanding phenomena  like self-control.  The second proposes a physiological  microfoundation for environmentally dependent motivational states  or drives.  This project uses physiological theories of  homeostasis and Pavlovian conditioning to build a theory of  endogenous motivational states.  For example, the model proposed  here explains how environmental cues elicit drives for  instantaneous gratification.  Finally, the third project builds  on the psychology literature about over optimism.  This project  examines the behavior of decision makers with over optimistic  priors and considers the consequences for consumption behavior.",
