 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513340  White      This award, covering a period of three years, will support the  travel of Dr. Stephen White, Department of Astronomy at the  University of Maryland, to conduct collaborative research  with Dr. Robert Duncan of the Australian Telescope National  Facility (AT).  The research will focus on a study of the radio  emission from the Southern Hemisphere star Eta Carinae.  Dr. White is currently conducting research through an NSF award  on radio continuum observations of active stars.  This grant will  add an international dimension to his current research.    Radio images of Eta Carinae, thought to be among the most massive  known stars in our Galaxy, can only be obtained through the 25m  AT dish located at Mpora.  Observations of this star have  revealed extraordinary radio emissions which have made it one of  the brightest radio stars in the sky.  The radio flux continues  to rise as gas surrounding the star apparently is being ionized  by a disturbance propagating outward from the star.  The goal of  the investigation is to follow the evolution of the outburst and  determine its nature, to study the ionized gas in order to  determine the kinematics of gas ejected from the star and the  cause of the different asymmetries seen in the outflow, and to  determine the physical conditions in the outflow by observing the  newly-ionized gas recombining.",
