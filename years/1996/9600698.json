The objective is to  bring together many of the U.S. and Brazilian leaders in  probability theory, and in particular the theory of  interacting particle systems, to work together in small  groups over a three-year period.  Rather than workshops,  the collaborations will be achieved through a series of  trips by individuals of both countries:  NSF will fund the  U.S. scientists, while a counterpart grant from CNPq in  Brazil will fund the Brazilian scientists.  The main theme  of investigation will be systems with many interacting  components that evolve with time, including problems in  biological and spin models, spatial point processes,  metastability and quasi-stationary distributions, and  hydrodynamic behavior of particle systems.    The interactions promoted through this project will  stimulate new directions in an important and active research  field. They will also promote new links in the international  community and provide opportunities for graduate students at  the institutions involved.    ***",
