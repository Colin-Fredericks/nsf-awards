The CNS contains a multiplicity of nicotinic and muscarinic  receptor subtypes, but many gaps remain in the understanding of  how these receptors contribute to physiological response of the  cells that receive cholinergic inputs. One way to begin to assess  the contribution of those receptors is to study to the responses  of neurons in the frog optic tectum.  The frog tectum is  particularly suitable because it has an unusually restricted  population of cholinergic axons, all of which are derived from  the nucleus isthmi. Whole-cell patch clamping will be used to  identify tectal cells that respond to cholinergic agonists.  The  distribution and morphology of the cells will be revealed by  biocytin filling.  The results will help to clarify the  contribution of cholinergic processes in central nervous system  neurons.  In addition, these experiments with Rana will provide  data for comparison with results of the similar experiments in  Xenopus frogs; this comparison is of interest because the  cholinergic axons that project to the Xenopus tectum from the  contralateral nucleus isthmi display dramatic plasticity during a  critical period of development of the cholinergic axons, whereas  such plasticity is absent in Rana.",
