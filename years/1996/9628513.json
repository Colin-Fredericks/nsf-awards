The Conference is scheduled to be held in summer 1997 on the Campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder.  The conference organizers are Professor Charbel Farhat from the Department of Aerospace Engineering Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, Professor Xiao Chuan Cai from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder,  and Professor Jan Mandel from the Department of Mathematics at the University of Colorado at Denver.  The profile of the organizers corresponds to the diverse constituencies of the Domain Decomposition field.  The conference is designed to promote the interaction between mathematicians, numerical analysts, physical scientists, engineers,  and computer scientists.  For this  tenth meeting, the focus theme will be High Performance Computing.  The conference organizers plan to devote a significant amount of effort on attracting the participation scientists not only from academia and government research laboratories, but also from the computing, simulation software, and key engineering industries.  Support will be provided for the active participation of graduate students who will benefit from exposing their research to a diversified audience of potential employers, and from keeping up-to-date with the latest developments in this field.***",
