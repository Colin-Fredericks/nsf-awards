These various topics have  grown out of a body of research over several decades and the  underlying unity is that solutions in the various problem  areas shed light on each other.       There are four major areas.  One is the study of  geometric symmetry breaking in such models as Ginzburg-  Landau vortices and Skyrmions.  The question of symmetry  breaking is a crucial one in modern physics.  The second  concerns electron correlations in many-body systems which,  currently, is a central topic in areas such as  superconductivity.  The third concern centers around the  structure of atoms and molecules.  The earlier work in these  areas, notably the problem of permanent dominance for  matrices and the question of the continuity or lack of it  for Steiner symmetrization of functions, which is a useful  tool in quantum mechanics and analysis.  ***",
