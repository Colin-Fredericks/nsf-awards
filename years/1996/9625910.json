University of California, Berkeley    CISE Postdoctoral Program:  Research in Computer Aided Design of VLSI Circuits with Emphasis on Deep Submicron Technology    This award supports associate John P. Lillis.  With the advent of deep submicron technology, the VLSI community is now faced with many new technical challenges which are currently inadequately addressed by the state of the art in Computer Aided Design for VLSI circuits.  Because of the scaling of feature size in the submicron domain, performance of VLSI systems is now largely dominated by interconnect delay.  Some powerful techniques for addressing this interconnect dominance are timing optimization by buffer insertion, wire sizing and performance driven routing.  We propose that the time during the award period be used to further develop these techniques into a mature, cohesive set of tools.    Among the research objectives of the proposals are    (1) development of algorithms for routing and buffer insertion to address the problems of electromigration and crosstalk noise,  (2) experimental evaluation of gate replication techniques for timing optimization and  (3) integration of the optimization techniques at a higher level in the physical layout process which included circuit placement.      All of these topics are of great practical importance in deep submicron systems of today and the future.",
