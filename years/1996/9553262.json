 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from this Presidential Faculty Fellow award, Professor   Nowick will elaborate the factors affecting the structure and   interactions of biologically relevant molecules. For example, the aim of   this work is to develop new strategies for the delivery of biologically   active nucleic acid derivatives across cell membranes and to gain   fundamental insight into protein structure. This is accomplished by   modifying a micelle with a receptor molecule such as a nucleic acid   component thymine. Subsequent, introduction of a complimentary drug which   hydrogen bonds with the base provides a means for transporting a rather   polar compound across lipid bilayers or biological membranes. By   exploring inhibitors and a variety of other molecular probes it will be   possible to gather information on 3 dimensional peptide structure and how   it effects molecular transport. In specific, this research addresses the   subject of protein folding which is a problem on many investigator's   palettes.  Understanding the principles by which physiologically active compounds   are bound and transported across cell membranes would provide scientists   with tools for making new drugs, making those presently known more   effective and creating new artificial systems which are medically   beneficial to mankind. This awardee and this project are destined to have   a major impact on this subject area and thereby is highly significant.",
