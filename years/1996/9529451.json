Laboratory  experiments indicate that heterogeneous reactions can occur between  sodium chloride and reactive atmospheric species such as nitrogen  oxides and ozone, however, the prevalence of these reactions in the  lower troposphere is still not understood.    The primary objective of this project is to use stable chlorine  isotopes ratios to support or dismiss reactions potentially  responsible for chlorine volatilization throughout the world's  oceans.  The isotopic ratios are altered during chemical reactions  where covalent bonds are formed or broken.  Thus, different  chemical reactions lead to different isotopic signatures.  Measured  isotopic fractionation in residual salt particles can be compared  to the fractionation factors of the reactions simulated in the  laboratory.    In this project, laboratory investigations will be carried out in  collaboration with Prof. Jonathan Abbatt at the University of  Chicago to determine the isotopic fractionation factors of  individual volatilization reactions.  In addition, archived aeroslo  samples from various oceanic regions will be analyzed for chlorine  fractionation,  From this information, the heterogeneous processes  responsible for chlorine volatilization in the aerosols will be  determined.",
