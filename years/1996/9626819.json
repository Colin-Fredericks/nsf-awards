There is an increasing sense of urgency within the US Antarctic  geologic community over the safe curation and accessibility of  rock and fossil collections and data acquired during research in  Antarctica.  There is concern over the loss of samples obtained  at great expense, including samples which are likely to be  valuable for new lines of investigation.  There is also concern  over minimizing negative environmental impacts of earth science  research in Antarctica, and over the availability of funding for  proper curation of samples in the future.  At present the lack of  a centralized curation facility for Antarctic samples greatly  inhibits potential use of existing samples for new projects.  Unpublished information about samples exists with individual  investigators but there has been no attempt to organize this for  the betterment of the science.  Development of a database is the  logical first step that must be taken toward more responsible  management of Antarctic rock and fossil materials.    The Antarctic Geologic Database will be a user-friendly system  accessible to the geologic community on Macintosh and IBM-based  personal computers via the World-Wide-Web.  It will allow easy  search, retrieval and loading of geologic information collected  by US geologists in Antarctica.  The design will be based on the  on-line archiving and cataloging system for the Synthetic  Aperture Radar images and data in the Remote Sensing Laboratory  at Byrd Polar Research Center, but will be specifically designed  to handle Antarctic and geologic requirements and information.  It will incorporate the best ideas of museum collections  management systems and rock repository databases currently used  in the Orton Geological Museum at the Ohio State University and  elsewhere in the USA and ove rseas.",
