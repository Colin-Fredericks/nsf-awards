 "awd_abstract_narration": "James Skinner is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical work on   spectroscopy and relaxation in liquids and glasses.  Studies are proposed   in three major areas: 1) spectral diffusion of individual molecules in   glasses; 2) ultrafast solvation dynamics in liquids; and 3) vibrational   relaxation in liquids.   A combination of formal theory and simulations   is used to interpret dynamical information obtained from various spectral   measurements obtained from fluorescence probes in glasses and in   solution.  Amorphous solids or glasses have many important technological   applications.  Optical spectroscopy of dilute flourescent compounds has   been used to probe the dynamics of glasses, and to obtain a better   understanding of the thermal properties for such systems.  The dynamics   of liquid solvents plays an important role in many chemical and   biological rate processes.  Solvent dynamics can also be probed   spectroscopically using  dilute solutions of fluorescent compounds.    Finally vibrational relaxation is intimately involved in liquid-state   chemical reaction dynamics.  In order to predict reaction rates, one   therefore has to understand vibrational relaxation rates.   Skinner will   also be studying vibrational relaxation processes in dilute solutions.",
