Establishment of the Timbuktu Academy, which has a summer       program for 100 plus middle and high school students annually       and an academic year program for undergraduates, and is       nationally recognized as an exceptional program for mentoring       minority students in SEM disciplines -- Bagayoko has       intensively mentored over 200 students through the Physics       Department and the Academy since his arrival at Southern in       1984;      II.  Demonstrable student outcomes -- among Academy students, two       have received the University s highest academic awards,       University Grand Marshals; two have received Ph.D.s in Physics       and five others are completing their Ph.D.; 10 students have       received the M.S. degree in Physics;  many of these students       are themselves making meaningful contributions to science and       society;      III. Significant institutional impact and replicability -- started       in Physics, the Academy program has expanded to Chemistry and       Engineering; while Southern is a predominantly Black       institution, students from a variety of backgrounds have been       included and succeeded in his program, e.g., Asian, Hispanic,       and Caucasian; and      IV.  Strong testimonials from current graduate students about the       influence of Bagayoko personally and the Academy program on       their academic and career pursuits.",
