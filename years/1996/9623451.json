 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stevens  9623451   The Summer Grants Program of the Council on Undergraduate Research offers fellowships to student/faculty teams to conduct 10-week research projects at their home institutions.  This program helps to remedy a problem faced by students and faculty in which the institution cannot sustain an REU-Site and the student cannot reasonably travel to an REU-Site to participate in a research program.  Increases in resources available to CUR have slowed, creating particularly acute funding limitations in the Geosciences.  Among proposals in 1995, only 20% were funded, while at least three others would have been had the resources been available.  This award will provide base funding for   CUR-GEO, including sufficient funds to support three fellowships each year for three years.  In addition, NSF will match non-federal dollars raised by CUR up to the cost of three additional fellowships.  The matching funds are intended to encourage additional contributions to CUR-GEO.  The fellowship recipients will be selected by CUR through its established mechanisms.  Results will be presented in CUR-sponsored poster sessions at regional meetings of the Geological Society of America.",
