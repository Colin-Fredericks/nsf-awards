 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9624940   Singh                               This research is on six subtopics in the area of resampling and  data-depth:  robustification of the bootstrap; second order  balanced confidence regions and bands based on resampling and  data depth; semiparamtric models and the bootstrap; resampling on  bioequivalence; inference spectrum; and descriptive statistics  and inferences based on data-depth.  These areas have been the  investigator's main focus of research in the past decade.   Efron's bootstrap in particular is the dominant subject  throughout the research.  The research may seem mathematical in  nature, however the potential impact on statistical methodology  has been the key factor in the selection of these research  problems.  Besides being of independent interest, the notion of  data-depth has an important application in bootstrap methodology.   The use of data-depth in multivariate descriptive-statistics is  being further explored in the research.    Bootstrap is a new technology in statistics, discovered by B.  Efron in 1979, which has made tremendous advances in the eighties  and the nineties.  This PI has been involved with these advances  since the early years of this discovery.  Bootstrap has had  impact in nearly every area of statistical sciences and this  research is geared toward its further advancement.  One of the  ideas included in this research is the construction of a spectrum  of statistical conclusions using bootstrap when some of the  responses in a survey are missing.  One other thrust of this  research is towards pictorial and other types of summaries when  data have many, many components.  The latter research is based on  what is known as data-depth, which is essentially a measure of  centrality of a datum with respect to the totality of the  data-cloud.  Other topics involve efficient computing when a  methodology is too computer intensive.",
