 "awd_abstract_narration": "Middlesex County College proposes a radical restructuring of mathematics, science and technology curricula for non-science majors.  Numerous reports and studies have deplored the low level of scientific and technological literacy in our society.  College students enrolled in non technical majors programs are required to take mathematics and science courses to fulfill general education requirement for graduation, but these courses bear no relationship to their major program.  Additionally, for the most part, the mathematics, science and technology courses that are available to fulfill general education requirements for majors in social science, humanities and business programs are designed to meet the needs of the mathematics  and science-based majors and are of little interest to non-science majors.    The goal of the project is to provide non-science majors with the breadth and depth of understanding in mathematics, science and technology to enable them to participate as informed citizens in discussion and decisions on critical issues facing the nation.  The College will take an interdisciplinary, integrated systems approach that fosters understanding of a variety of mathematics and science concepts in an applied context and that is grounded in issues and problems that have a science concepts in an applied context and that is grounded in issues and problems that have a clear impact on the lives of students and can, thus, be seen to be relevant by the most\"unscientific\".  It will incorporate the integration of social science and humanities concepts to provide a context for consideration of the social import of the mathematics and science concepts presented.      To accomplish this goal, faculty, working in interdisciplinary teams will create, pilot-test and implement module-based courses that incorporate instruction in mathematics, science and technology within the context of two themes:  the environment and telecommunications.  These courses will form the models to an additional four themes tha t will be developed by the College subsequent to this project.  These integrated offerings will replace current curricula choices for non-science majors.  The restructured curricula will provide non-science majors with opportunities for learning mathematics, science and technology that are relevant and meaningful.  As a result, students will be more likely to continue to learn and read about current issues in which the sciences and technology play major roles, and will be capable of making informed decisions regarding scientific and technological questions.      The College has individually, and consortium with other institutions, participated in major mathematics and science education initiatives to ensure that both students enrolling in programs and those graduating, have the knowledge and technical skills necessary for successful employment and further education.  This project is an extension of those efforts",
