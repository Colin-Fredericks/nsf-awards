 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heterogeneous parallel systems incorporate diverse models of  parallelism within a single machine or across machines.  These systems provide high performance for large, diverse  applications. Heterogeneity unfortunately complicates  software development. Users currently hand parallelize each  task for each architecture. These programs are not portable  and must be recoded if changes occur (e.g., machines are  added or removed).  The user is also burdened with  performing the appropriate optimizations to achieve high  performance. A compiler can solve these problems. The most  important advantages of a compiler based approach are:    (1) Portability and Ease of Use: Users program the  appropriate model of parallelism for their algorithms. The  compiler automatically maps them on to the specifics of the  available architectures. (2) High Performance: The compiler  optimizes with aggressive, target specific optimizations and  coordinates diverse hardware to achieve excellent  performance.    To manage heterogeneity the compiler must: target diverse  architectures, adjust optimization strategies to suit  targets, exploit run-time changes in machine availability,  and allow languages to evolve.  The objective of this  research is to investigate a compilation system to support  these requirements. The system will use an innovative  compiler organization and representations in order to  provide the flexibility that heterogeneity requires.  This  project concentrates on the design and implementation of  this compiler infrastructure.  The system will be used to  investigate automatic parallelization and partitioning  strategies for a heterogeneous target.  It will address  issues such as how to map programmer models of parallelism  on to the corresponding machine and how to further optimize  it for total system performance.  This compiler-based  approach will provide an infrastructure capable of  performing the advanced dynamic and static optimizations  that heterogeneous systems demand for high performa nce.  ***",
