 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. John Ellis, Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota-Twin   Cities, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Program of the Chemistry Division  to study highly reduced   organometallics of the early d- and f-block elements.  The two primary   themes are the use of arene radical anions as precursors to classes of   homo- and heteroleptic arene complexes and the search for new carbon   monoxide and related acceptor ligand complex chemistry of these elements.   Homoleptic arene complexes containing polycyclic arenes such as   naphthalene, anthracene and substituted versions thereof will be   investigated. Such species are expected to be quite labile and may   function as neutral or anionic `naked` atom reagents for the early   transition metals. Access to unknown or rare homoleptic anionic complexes   will be pursued through reactions of these and related arenemetallates   with ligands other than carbon monoxide, such as phosphanes, phosphites,   isocyanides, dienes, and alkynes. Highly reduced organometallics are   important to an understanding of the chemical and structural properties   of unusually electron-rich compounds of very electropositive elements,   and provide a means of studying the chemistry of these elements in   previously inaccessible or unknown oxidation states.   Some metals, especially zirconium and tantalum, form highly reactive and   useful reagents in the presence of organic ligands such as naphthalene (a   common ingredient in moth balls) and when they are in a highly reduced   state.  `Highly reduced` simply means that more electrons have been added   to these metal complexes than they would normally have, often giving them   an overall negative charge. This work addresses the synthesis of such   highly reduced complexes and the issues which control their reactivity   once they are formed.  These complexes may prove to be useful reagents in   inorganic, organometallic and organic synthesis.",
