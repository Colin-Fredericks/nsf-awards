 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9622890  PI:  Zhijian Wu  University of Alabama @ Tuscaloosa    In the past several years, the principal investigator has mainly focused  his research on function and operator theory on analytic (one or several  variables) or monogenic function spaces. The operators include Hankel,   Toeplitz, commutators, multipliers, bilinear forms, approximation and atomic  decomposition. The spaces (analytic or harmonic) are Bergman, Hardy, Dirichlet  and the scale of capacity related spaces which includes the Bloch space  and the space of bounded mean oscillation functions. The study also involves  differential operators such as d-bar, Laplacian, Div, Curl and Dirac operators.  The principal investigator proposes to continue his ongoing study, to explore  more connections and applications of function and operator theory to other  areas. Although there are many problems related to the study which arise in  nature, the principal investigator plans to focus specifically on the  aforementioned operators on potential related function spaces, the function  theory of these spaces, Nehari type problems in Dirichlet spaces, minimum  solution operators to some differential systems and Clifford analysis in the  theory of compensated compactness. He will use function and operator   theoretical tools and techniques in harmonic analysis, together with new   ideas and methods in his investigation.       Beside their own charm in pure mathematics, problems in this project have  rich connections and applications to many fields of applied sciences. For  example Hankel operators (or more generally commutators and bilinear forms) are  very popular in various aspects of engineering design and system science. Their  behavior provides important information to automatic control, navigation   systems and robust stabilization. The study of Hankel and related operators   in various underlying spaces will provide effective ways to deal with control   problems in different situations. Another good example is the recent discover   o f the connection between Clifford analysis and the compensated compactness   phenomenon in non-linear partial differential equations of multi-variable   spaces. Experience and previous achievement indicate that the principal   investigator has the potential to accomplish his goal.",
