 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625856  Pine  Over the past ten years, University of California, Santa Barbara  has become one of the premier centers for research on complex  liquids and has made fundamental advances in the understanding of  polymer solutions, colloidal suspensions, surfactant systems, and  biomaterials.  Research on these systems is highly  interdisciplinary with participants from several departments  including Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering,  Materials, Chemistry, Physics, and Biology.  The study of the  flow behavior of these systems has been a central and consistent  focus, with many innovations being developed at UCSB.  %%%  This award is for the acquisition of a commercial fluids  rheometer and an argon ion laser in order to develop a high  performance measurement system capable of making simultaneous  rheological and optical measurements.  The instrument will be  used to study the relationship between flow and structure in  complex fluids.  The rheometer is capable of making dynamic,  transient, and steady state measurements of shear and normal  stresses in macromolecular solutions and suspensions.  To this  rheometer, we will add the capability of performing several  optical measurements including small and large angle light  scattering, microscopy, and flow birefringence.  The optical  measurements will provide crucial information about structural  changes which accompany rheological changes of the fluid under  study.  By simultaneously performing both rheological and  structural measurements, this instrument will significantly  advance the state-of-the-art and provide a unique and powerful  tool for understanding the flow and processing of complex fluids.  ***",
