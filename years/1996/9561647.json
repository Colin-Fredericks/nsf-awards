 "awd_abstract_narration": "9561647  Woltosz     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project to be conducted at Words+, Inc. focuses on enabling physically-disadvantaged students to conduct laboratory experiments in the physical sciences.  It is designed to test the feasibility of developing efficient computer simulations of laboratory experiments based on first principle mathematical models that can be run by disabled students on personal computers with an absolute minimum of motor input.  It combines: (1) state-of-the-art personal computer technology; (2) existing knowledge about dynamic simulations of a variety of mechanical, chemical, electrical, magnetic, and optical processes; and (3) existing technologies developed by Words+, Inc., that enable persons with severe disabilities to operate sophisticated computer software with very little motion--as little as the blink of an eye.  The ability to experience firsthand the results of simulated experiments and to control the setup and operation of those experiments will change the perspective of the physically-disabled person in the laboratory from that of a spectator to an active participant.  This new capability can serve to motivate more disabled students to seek careers in the sciences or careers requiring scientific background, thus empowering  those whose brains function well but whose bodies prevent them from working in more physical forms of employment in their efforts to realize their potential.  The famous theoretical astrophysicist Professor Stephen Hawking of the University of Cambridge in England (a Words+ user) is a clear example of a severely physically-disabled person who is making major contributions to science.   Software that can be run by the physically-disabled can also be run by the able-bodied, so the results of this project have the potential to lead to software with strong commercial potential.  The final commercial products from this effort will be CD-ROM's or other similar media with softwape simulations covering a wide range of scienc e and technical disciplines and distributed through mass market channels to high school and university students around the world.  Accurate, first principle simulation is currently used in some industries.  Its use in education is both inevitable and can be expected to evolve continuously for the foreseeable future as the knowledge base on which mathematical models are derived improves and as affordable computer resources continue to increase",
