Simultaneous measurements using the laser-based techniques of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), and Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) is proposed.  From these measurements detailed information on the instantaneous velocities and therefore the strain rate and vorticity fields, the temperature distributions and a conserved scalar and its gradients will be obtained as the degree of heat release is varied.  The PI intends to use either hydrogen or methane diluted with helium (and possibly nitrogen) as the fuel mixture and to vary the heat release by changing the proportion of hydrogen/methane in the fuel mixture.  It is expected that fast chemistry will prevail for most of the run conditions and Reynolds numbers will be varied in the range of 2,000 to in excess of 20,000.    The PI will also seek to maintain a close relationship between the experiments and modeling requirements.  To this end the PI plans to use Dr. J. E. Broadwell as a consultant for the model development and to help guide the direction of the experimental program.  The proposed research in addition to describing the changes to the flowfield associated with heat release seeks alqo to provide modelers with the following information: actual strain rates throughput the flame brush, residence times of various fluid elements, scalar dissipation rates, entrainment and paths of air, and scale distributions.",
