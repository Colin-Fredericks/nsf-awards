 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624995  Mohney    This CAREER research project addresses the formation and the chemical etching of native  oxides on III-V nitride surfaces.  The chemical and structural nature of intentionally and  unintentionally formed oxides on the semiconductor surfaces will be studied, and chemical  processing steps for the preparation of semiconductor surfaces for further devic  e processing will be developed.  Complementary techniques including spectroscopic  ellipsometry, Auger electron spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and  conventional and high resolution transmission electron microscopy will be employed. The  nature of the oxide, which is currently unknown, will strongly influence which chemical  etchants w  ill be most effective for removing it. Appropriate chemical treatments for removing the  oxide and producing surfaces with the least residual oxygen and carbon contamination will  be developed, given that many processing steps, such as the formation of ohmic contacts and  Schottky barriers, are most conveniently accomplished when a brief exposure to  air is allowed  between chemical  preparation and  further processing.  Comparison of the  effectiveness of  the chemical  surface preparation  procedures will be  accomplished  through the  fabrication and  characterization of  non-reactive ohmic  contacts and/or  Schottky barriers  to GaN.  %%%  Along with the basic research activity, this project incorporates material on surface  preparation of semiconductors into an undergraduate laboratory course on electronic and  photonic materials. Other educational initiatives to be undertaken include updating a  senior-level laboratory course on metals science and engineering, increasing the use of c  omputer modeling and visualization in the undergraduate curriculum, and increasing  participation of undergraduates in research. The proposed basic investigations are expected  to contribute fundamental materials science knowledge of technological relevance to  advanced microelectronic devices  and circuits.  The knowledge and understanding gained fro  m this research project is expected to contribute  in a general way to improving the performance of  advanced devices and circuits used in computing,  information processing, and telecommunications by  providing a fundamental understanding and a basis  for designing and producing improved materials and  processes.  ***  _",
