 "awd_abstract_narration": "Renewed funding is provided to continue development and install an  undersea observatory that is connected to shore-based laboratories  via a fiber-optic cable.  The Hawaii Undersea Geo-Observatory  (HUGO) integrates marine fiberoptic cable and submersible  technologies to prmvide the ocean science community with an  unmanned laboratory on the ocean floor at the summit of Loihi  seamount.  Loihi, an active submarine volcano, is located about 35  km southeast of the Island of Hawaii.  Its shallow summit (about  1000m below sea level), exciting geology, earthquakes, frequent  volcanic activity, and proximity to land make it an ideal site to  install a permanent geo-laboratory, and begin real-time monitoring  of processes occurring at the ocean floor.      The modular observatory has the potential to house more than 100  experiments from every ocean science discipline, supplying  experiments with electrical power, command capability, and  real-time continuous data transmission to shore.  Once installed,  scientists will be able to study submarine volcanic, biological,  and oceanographic processes continuously.  HUGO data will also be  used by the U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory in  their studies of Hawaiian volcanoes, and by the Pacific Tsunami  Warning Center in characterization of tsunamis from distant  earthquakes.    HUGO earthquake and acoustic data will be made available to local  schools for teaching and projects, and sub-sets will be presented  on the INTERNET.  Initial experiments will include a broad band  hydrophone sampled at 42 KHz, which will be sensitive to biological  and other noises over a wide range of audio frequencies.    The use of cables to connect seafloor observatories and  experimental sites to shore is a strong area of interest for  several factions of the ocean science community.  What is learned  from this project will have applications for future cable  installations as well.",
