 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is still unclear how the combination of an internal  clock  and environmental   light regulate the well-known daily  circadian  changes in activity of both   vertebrate and invertebrate animals.  Molecular mechanisms are being   discovered in many laboratories, but little is known about the biochemical and   physiological mechanisms in the eye and brain.  Clock function prepares the   photoreceptors in the retina of the eye to function optimally in different   backgrounds of daylight, dusk, or night; in turn, visual input from the eyes help   modulate the correct timing of the running clock in the brain.  This project uses   the horseshoe crab, Limulus, as a model system that is amenable to extensive   biochemical analysis.  Molecular, biochemical and immunochemical approaches   are used to see how the clock may produce and modulate (phosphorylated)   particular proteins in the retina.  One protein in the photoreceptors is known to   have both structural and enzyme properties, and experiments test how its   functions are modulated by the clock input from the brain to the eye.  The   biochemical nature of how the clock input to the eye can  prime  the   photoreceptor response to light is studied by testing the role of the clock and the   role of light in driving gene expression in the eye, separately or in combination.     These studies will provide new insights into the biochemical processes   underlying the day-to-night changes in the retina that are critical for normal   vision.  The impact extends beyond visual neuroscience to the analysis of   circadian behavior, and potentially to how human daily cyclic activity may be   modulated.",
