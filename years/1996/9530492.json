 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beran          Modern statistical methods for large data sets rely on rotation of the   data in high dimensions (as in Fourier analysis, wavelet transforms, or   projection pursuit), on smoothing (as in nonparametric regression), on   shrinkage (as in Stein estimation or ridge regression), on variable selection   (as in linear regression), and on combinations of these ideas (such as   thresholding of wavelet or Fourier coefficients). Concurrently, statisticians   have introduced computer-aided techniques, such as cross-validation or the   bootstrap, for assessing the uncertainty in patterns recovered though data   analyses. This research project develops: (a) necessary and sufficient   conditions under which bootstrap distributions converge correctly plus   diagnostic methods for detecting bootstrap failure in data analyses; (b)   modulation estimators that recover a signal from noise by adaptively tapering    the rotated data plus confidence regions for the signal that are centered at   the modulation estimators; (c) nonparametric bootstrap confidence sets for all   pairwise rotational differences among the mean directions (or mean axes) of   several independent samples of directional (or axial) data.           The computer revolution in scientific and social measurement has created   large, complex data sets. In response, data analysts have devised computer-   assisted methods for recovering patterns from data. However, incompleteness of   the data as well as measurement errors induce possible errors in the   conclusions reached. The recent controversy about Census undercounts in the   cities is a prominent example. How much uncertainty is there in patterns   recovered through sophisticated data-analyses?  The statistical technique   called the bootstrap, which relies on fast computers, has grown since 1979   into the most widely applicable method for assessing uncertainties inherent in   data-analyses. Unfortunately, bootstrap methods, as currently used, can   sometimes give a misleading asse ssment of uncertainty. Part (a) of this   research project provides computer-intensive ways to detect and to correct   such bootstrap failure. This portion of the work contributes to the Federal   Strategic Area of high-performance computing. Part (b) of the project develops   uncertainty assessments for signals recovered from noisy measurements.   Electronic images recorded by a satellite camera are an instance of such   measurements. This portion of the work provides statistical methodology for   analyzing satellite data in the Federal Strategic Area of global change. Part   (c) of the project develops uncertainty assessments for analyses of   directional and axial data sets. Geophysical measurements in earthquake   studies, oil exploration, and studies of volcanic activity are examples of   such directional and axial data.",
