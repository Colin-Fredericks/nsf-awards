 "awd_abstract_narration": "9560332  Cao         Quick and effective laboratory and field nondestructive evaluation of structural damage is important for earthquake studies. A conceptual design using the CSL high sensitivity, direct photon-electron conversion x-ray or gamma-ray image system is proposed to investigate a novel real-time nondestructive structural damage measurement technique. This new technique is to develop an x-ray or gamma-ray image detecting and processing system to directly visualize and quantify the structural damage, including damage location, damage pattern and sizes. A real-time assessment of the earthquake damaging process is also possible to be monitored by this fast respond x-ray or gamma-ray detector and the associated system. The proposed system can be used either in the Laboratory or in the field. During the proposed Phase I effort, CSL will work together with the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research at Suny Buffalo to conduct a series of experiments to quantify the major design parameters of the system to prove the practicality of this novel technique. This research shall result in a portable, effective, low cost and easy to use x-ray or gamma-ray inspection system for structural damage assessment. This system will benefit both laboratory and field work, and reduce the cost of earthquake damage assessment significantly.       The proposed research would lead to better understanding of structural damages caused by earthquake. The technique, once developed, offers a very useful tool for laboratory studies and field inspection, monitoring and measurement of earthquake damages. The proposed real-time, nondistortion, high spatial/temporal, and portable x-ray and gamma-ray system shall also help generate business opportunities for inspection and monitoring of public structures, utilities and component production.",
