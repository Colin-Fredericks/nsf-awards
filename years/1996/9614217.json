 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to address some of the barriers that limit accessibility and prevent widespread use of spoken language technology. In particular, the lack of portability of today's technology means that application development requires significant engineering for each new task. As a result, the high cost and level of expertise entailed restrict research and development activities to a handful of specialized laboratories.  A partnership with the Universidad de las Americas, Puebla has been established to address this portability issue. Through a program of collaborative research and technology transfer, we are developing an integrated toolkit for learning about, researching and developing spoken language systems in both English and Spanish languages.  This involves creating suitable infrastructure, language resources and teaching materials, as well as performing basic research to improve on the technology underlying the toolkit.  The results of this work will benefit large numbers of people.  We plan to distribute the resulting toolkit and resources by making them available at no cost to academic institutions throughout the United States and Mexico. This, in turn, will promote interest and understanding into spoken language technology by allowing people to rapidly design, build and experiment with spoken language systems.",
