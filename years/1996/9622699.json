 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622699  Goldburg  This award provides support for the acquisition of a laser  Doppler velocimeter for the purpose of studying turbulence  in soap films.  The goal of this project is to better  understand two-dimensional turbulence as well as the physics  of a soap film under shear.  We have demonstrated that a  laser Doppler velocimeter is a powerful instrument for  exploring turbulence in soap films and for studying their  unexpected rheological properties.  %%%  It follows from the basic laws that govern fluid flow, that  two-dimensional (2D) turbulence differs qualitatively from  its three-dimensional (3D) counterpart.  Soap films are so  thin relative to their lateral dimensions that, to a very  good approximation, they should behave like a 2D fluid.  Nevertheless there are very few experiments to support this  claim.  In our laboratory we have produced strong enough  turbulence in a soap film that its two dimensional character  becomes apparent.  The instrument is one of general utility  and will be used in ordinary three-dimensional turbulence as  well.  ***",
