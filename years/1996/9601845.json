 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary      This  proposal  seeks funding for a new multi-processor  computer  for   structural  biology  and  computational  physics   at   The  Rockefeller  University. Structural biologists need  increasingly  faster computers with memories in excess of 256 MB because of the  size  of  data sets from X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy,  and  electron microscopy that need to be processed and fitted  by  complicated  models. In addition, the main subject of  structural  biology,   understanding  the  relation  between  structure   and  function,  frequently depends on large computer simulations  such  as  molecular dynamics and protein structure modeling.  Likewise,  calculations in computational physics also require more computing  power  and  memory than currently available in order to  simulate  larger  systems  at  a higher resolution and  to  explore  larger  parameter spaces. The projects of the eleven major users  include  crystallographic,  NMR,  and  electron  microscopic  studies   of  structure, dynamics and function of proteins. The proteins  under  study   are   involved   in   signal  transduction,   chromosomal  replication,  transcription, and transmission of signals  through  cell  membranes.  Additional work by  the  major  users  includes  protein identification and characterization by mass spectrometry,  simulations  of  protein,  DNA,  and  chromosome  structure   and  dynamics,  and  modeling  of neuron function  and  visual  cortex  architecture.   The   researchers  are  currently   using   small  workstations,  many of which are more than three  years  old  and  have  less  than  64  MB of memory. Speed  and  memory  of  these  workstations  are  increasingly  restricting.  The  existing  and  future  needs can best be met by a multi-processor computer  such  as  the Silicon Graphics Power Challenge XL system with 12 R10000  processors and 1.25 GB of memory, which we propose to purchase. A  multi-processor server computer is more suited to a  small  group   of   independent  users  than  is  a  large  number   of   client  workstations  because of the speed deriving from fast  processors  and  from coarse parallelization, because memory and software can  be  shared  among several users, and because of  the  savings  in  support   and   maintenance.  The  use  of  a   locally   located  multi-processor computer is also more appropriate than the use of  national  supercomputer centers because of the  faster  and  more  flexible  networking, sustained availability of computing  power,  smaller  backlog, and access to local consultants. In  comparison  with  the current equipment, the new server computer will provide  a   four-fold  increase  in  computation  speed  and  will  allow  effective  execution of very large jobs by avoiding  swapping  to  hard  disks.  The  server  will  also  free  the  current  client  workstations   for  their  original  purpose,   interactive   and  graphical  work,  both of which are impeded  by  the  large  jobs  running  in  the  background. As a result, current  computational  bottlenecks   in   protein   structure   refinement   in    X-ray  crystallography, NMR, and electron microscopy will be eliminated.  The  server  will  thus help in the structural  determination  of  eukaryotic RNA polymerase system, DNA polymerase complex, E. coli  RNA  polymerase, voltage-gated potassium channel, Abl SH(32) dual  domain,  and  other proteins. It will also allow many simulations  that  are  currently out of reach. For example, NMR and molecular  dynamics will be used to determine motions of protein domains and  large  loops  on  the  nanosecond time scale;  proteins  will  be  identified  rapidly by mass spectrometry and database  searching,  which  will  be useful in the analysis of sequences  produced  by  genome  projects; protein structure modeling by homology will  be  improved  by  simultaneous optimization  of  the  model  and  the  alignment,  which will allow a significantly larger  fraction  of  protein  sequences  determined by genome projects  to  be  modeled  with  useful accuracy; molecular orbital calculations of  retinal  and  its environment will elucidate the opsin shift mechanism  in  visual  pigments;  the experimental data on the  condensation  of  eukaryotic  chromosomes will be analyzed  statistically  and  the  models  for  this  process will be proposed; and  more  realistic  neural   models  will  be  solved  that  may  result  in   better  understanding of the function of the brain. The server will  also  provide  graduate  students  and  postdoctoral  fellows  at   The  Rockefeller University an opportunity to program and exploit  the  latest  generation  of mini supercomputers.  This  will  be  made  easier   and  encouraged  by  the  existing  infrastructure   for  networking  and consulting. In addition, the new server  computer  will  facilitate planned recruitment of new faculty in the  areas  of  structural biology and computational physics. And finally, it  will  stimulate  the  growing interest  of  all  the  faculty  in  structure-function studies in biology and in the problems at  the  interface between physics and biology.",
