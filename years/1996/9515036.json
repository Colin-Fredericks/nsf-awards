 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long standing issue of great importance in economics is how and  why money inluences economic activity.  There is a fairly good  understanding of what happens when the Federal Reserve Board  changes its policy by injecting more money into the economy.   However, what is not well understood is just how and why this  happens.  The models typically used to explain the monetary  transmission mechanism are generally thought to be flawed since  they rely on the assumption that individuals are irrational;  either in the way they form expectations about the future or in  the way that they react to profit opportunities in the labor  market.  The aim of this research is to explain the monetary  transmission mechanism without having to assume irrational  behavior on the part of economic agents.  A class of general  equilibrium models are developed in which agent's beliefs about  the future are capable of influencing what happens in the  present.  This research is important because it will shed light  on just how expectations are influenced by actions of the FED,  and, thus, provide a better understanding of the mechanism by  which monetary policy effects overall economic activity.",
