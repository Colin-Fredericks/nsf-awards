 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624051  Rausher          Natural  populations of the ivyleaf morning  glory  (Ipomoea  hederacea)  contain two distinct leaf shapes:   some  plants  possess  leaves  with  three  lobes,  while  others  possess  unlobed  leaves.  Leaf shape differences of  this  magnitude  have been shown to affect leaf temperature regulation (lobed  leaves  dissipate  heat  more  effectively),  and  herbivore  preference (some insects use leaf shape to recognize  edible  plants).   However,  an affect of leaf  shape  variation  on  plant  performance in the field has never been demonstrated.  Preliminary  results from field observations of  this  plant  species   suggest   that  lobed  and  unlobed   plants   are  specialized  for  different environmental  conditions.   The  study  will  use large scale field experiments  to  quantify  plant  performance as a function of leaf shape in a  natural  setting.  The study will also use greenhouse experiments  to  precisely  control  relevant  environmental  factors.   This  approach  allows  the determination of the  effect  of  leaf  shape  on  plant performance; may lead to an explanation  of  how  this  peculiar  polymorphism  is  maintained;  and  may  provide some insights into the importance of leaf shape  for  survival of plants in different environments.",
