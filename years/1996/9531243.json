 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work, by Assistant Professor Li Sun of the University of   Minnesota-Twin Cities, focuses on single nanopores in metal membranes and   is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  The   nanopores are ion-conducting and contain a surface modifier which binds   to an analyte ion selectively.  The capture of an ion transiting the pore   modulates the pore ionic conductivity which is the signal of interest.    This approach has the advantage that analyte crossing the pore need not   be capable of producing redox or spectrometric signals.  Pore fabrication   will be investigated using both electrochemical and self-assembled   monolayer technology to control the pore structure.  The nature of   molecular transport through a pore will be studied using surface   analytical techniques including surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and   electrochemical methods.  Knowledge gained from these fundamental studies   will be used to develop new detectors for chemical analysis, particularly   of biochemicals.  A major objective of this work is to fabricate structured pores of   approximately small molecule dimensions in metal membranes for the   purpose of studying the transport of molecules across such a pore.    Fundamental study of the chemistry of ion binding to selective sites   within the pore is useful because ion channels are an important and not   yet fully understood mechanism for control of information flow across   biological membranes.  A second major goal of the project is to develop   new types of detectors for chemical analysis which also utilize the   ability of the active sites in the pore to selectively interact with ions   of interest in the pore solution.",
