 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS  9622977   Greg Hjorth, UCLA    The notion of group is a central one in modern mathematics, specifically  that of a group acting on a set.  This induces an orbit equivalence  relation : for the group G we have that the orbit of a point is the set of  all gx where g is in G . This in turn cues mathematicians to the abstract  study of the orbit equivalence relation, now isolated from the original  investigation of the action.  While work of some researchers on the edge of  ergodic theory illuminates the case when G is locally compact, the branch  of logic known as model theory is intimately concerned with the orbit  equivalence relations induced by the infinite symmetric group S of all  permutations of the countable set N, equipped with the topology of  pointwise convergence.  Hjorth's project is directed towards unifying these  very diverse areas under the study of continuous actions of separable  metrizable topological groups, commonly known as Polish groups.  This class  of groups includes some familiar topological groups which fail to be  locally compact, such as:  S,  the homeomorphism group of the unit  interval,  and the group of automorphisms of Hilbert space.      The notion of a group action can be understood by the following simple  analogy. Suppose  a fleck of sand is travelling through space, and we know  its position and velocity at a given time, call it t. In principle it  should be possible to calculate the position and velocity of the same fleck  at a later time, call it t + s. In this sense we can say that the real  number s \"acts\" on the collection of all possible positions and velocities.  From any position and velocity at time t, the number s produces the  position and velocity at time t+s.  All possible states reachable from a  specified starting point is what is called an orbit. The terminology  suggests an analogy: rather than looking at the position of a planet at one  fixed time, we look instead at the collection of all positions it can  occupy throughout its year: in  other words, its orbit. Hjorth's project  considers group actions and orbits in a very general context, with  particular focus on complicated groups which arise from logical  considerations.  Certain classifications are provided these group actions  and orbits, to give an understanding of when one is more complicated than  another. This research is foundational. A central goal  is  a deepened  understanding  of the subtle nature of  many  mathematical objects, such  as orbits of points in space.",
