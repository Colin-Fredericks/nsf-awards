 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615020    Design of drilled foundations for urban infrastructure  rehabilitation  requires that a significant reduction be taken in the  strength of the  geomaterials into which they are installed, which leads to  relatively high  construction costs.  With increasing budgetary constraints  on  infrastructure management, there is an immediate need to  develop  straightforward and practical means to restore the strength  of geomaterial  to reduce the cost of construction.    This research explores a speculative but potentially  economically important  method to enhance the capacity and predictability of side  shear in drilled  shafts by the use of lime slurry conditioning.  In  particular, this project  addresses the conditioning of the soil/concrete interface  through a  coordinated study involving both laboratory and field tests  in natural  soil.    This study will involve the joint efforts of both the  University of Houston  and Bogazici University in Turkey, and is supported by  contributions in  kind from both the International Association of Foundation  Drilling and the  National Lime Association.  ***",
