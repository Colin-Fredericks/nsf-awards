 "awd_abstract_narration": "96-14028  Dymond         This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean  Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1) a better  understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic and  inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the physical,  ecological and biogeochemical factors and processes which  regulate the magnitude and variability of these fluxes, and (3)  placing these fluxes into the context of the contemporary global  carbon cycle.       This work is one of forty-four projects that are  collaborating in the Southern Ocean Experiment, a three-year  effort south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone to track the  flow of carbon through its organic and inorganic pathways from  the air-ocean interface through the entire water column into the  bottom sediment.   The experiment will make use of the RVIB  Nathaniel B. Palmer and the R/V Thompson.       This component, a collaborative study by scientists from the  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Oregon State University,  and the New Zealand Oceanographic Institution, concerns the  export of particulate forms of carbon downward from the upper  ocean.  The observations will be obtained from an array of time-  series sediment traps, and will be analyzed to quantify export  fluxes from the Subtropical Front to the Ross Sea, over an 18-  months period beginning the early austral summer of 1996.  The  measurement program will two annual phytoplankton blooms.  The  southern ocean provides a unique opportunity to investigate the  processes controlling export flux in contrasting biogeochemical  ocean zones demarcated by oceanic fronts.  The temperature  changes at the fronts coincide with gradients in nutrient  concentrations and plankton ecology, resulting in a large  latitudinal change in the ratio of calcium to silica taken up by  the phytoplankton communities.  This experiment will provide data  on how the biological pump operates in the Southern Ocean and how  it could potentially impact the level of atmospheric c arbon  dioxide.  The observed export fluxes of organic carbon, nitrogen,  inorganic carbon, biogenic silica and alumina are central to the  goals of the JGOFS program.",
