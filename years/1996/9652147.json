 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New Science Project was developed by a team of faculty and administrators in response to the recognition that too large a number of students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences were entering Grinnell stating a desire to have science majors, but ultimately leaving science. These students were academically talented; they graduated, but not in science. There was also strong advisory support in developing and encouraging these efforts from the Trustees and a special Presidential advisory committee of alumni. This group of Trustees and alumni, who are science graduates, have actively supported these activities by coming to Grinnell and speaking with students, as well as with financial support. A clear indicator of the support received by the Trustees is their decision to go forward with the $15.3 million renovation and the expansion of Grinnell's science facilities, which they agreed was necessary in order to physically accommodate the curricular and pedagogical changes in the science division.    The New Science Project is an integral part of a larger division-wide reform effort by Grinnell's science faculty and administration which includes making significant changes in teaching methodologies and the curriculum, coupled with the renovation and expansion of the science facilities. The larger science program reforms promote collaborative learning and foster the communication and the interchange of ideas central to a vital community of learners. In order to achieve this Grinnell's science faculty are introducing significant change in both pedagogy and in content. By coupling creative thought with experimentation, we hope to make the study of science an intrinsic part of the liberal arts education at Grinnell. The New Science Project seeks to make the study of science accessible to all students and to increase their chances of success. While the reforms which the Project has and will introduce are options/services available to all students, we have targeted those students who  are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. To encourage these students, we have developed a multi-disciplinary program that includes curricular reform experiments in all five science departments, a pre-orientation program for invited students prior to their freshman year, and opportunities for early research experiences. Curricular reforms consisted primarily of one-credit workshop/laboratory courses parallel to the four-credit introductory courses. Now in its third full year of operation, assessment of the program has identified directions for further improvement. Workshops and seminars in Biology, Chemistry, and Mathematics were definitely needed, but were not affecting enough students, and needed better coordination with the introductory course; and students needing extra assistance in introductory courses had limited resources. Curricular reform projects, have emerged to meet these curricular needs and supplementary student assistance resources will be provided.    This proposal to the NSF seeks support for the second generation of reforms as part of Grinnell College's New Science Project. We propose development of completely revised introductory courses in Biology, Chemistry, and Math. The Physics Workshop series, introduced under the first phase of the New Science Project, will continue throughout the project. We also propose the coordination and expansion of student tutoring and mentoring services through a new Science Learning Center.",
