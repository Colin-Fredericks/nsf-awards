 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Straub is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work on developing new   algorithms for global optimization, enhanced sampling and the   determination of reaction pathways.  Two areas of algorithmic development   will be explored.  The first area involves the use of generalized   statistics, as opposed to Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics, which can be used   to describe highly delocalized distributions of configurations for   systems that are strongly localized in the standard statistics.  This   technique leads to a higher likelihood of finding low energy   configurations.  The second area of research involves an optimization   technique known as quantum mechanical annealing, in which the value of   Planck's constant is greatly exaggerated causing the system to `spread   out` in space and more effectively seek the lowest energy configurations   by tunneling through energy barriers that would otherwise be hard to   climb over.  This technique employs imaginary-time path integral quantum   simulations in a novel way.  Applications include: 1) model protein   folding; 2) optimal reaction path determination; and 3) enhanced sampling   of molecular configurations for the computation of average thermodynamic   properties.  Computer simulations have provided a number of molecular level insights   into chemical processes which occur in solution and on surfaces.  The   technique is very powerful, but is limited by statistical sampling   problems associated with the speed of current supercomputers and the time   available to perform such  simulations.  Straub is developing a new   algorithm for performing molecular simulations which should be a major   improvement in statistical sampling.  If successful, this new algorithm   could provide a significant decrease in the amount of computational   resources required to obtain meaningful sampling statistics in molecular   simulations.",
