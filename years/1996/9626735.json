 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626735   Stebbins    The  proposed  studies will use nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  spectroscopy at ambient temperature to determine  the  effects  of  varying fictive temperature on glass structure,  which will constrain temperature effects on liquid structure  in  the  vicinity  of the glass transition.  In  situ,  high  resolution,  high temperature NMR on boron, oxygen,  sodium,  aluminum,  and  silicon nuclides will be used  to  determine  temperature effects on average coordination environment. The  effects of observed structural changes on entropy, enthalpy,  activities,  molar  volumes, and other  properties  will  be  assessed   using  simple  thermodynamic  models.  At   lower  temperatures but still in the liquid range, static and magic  angle  spinning  NMR will be used to observe exchange  among  structural  species and measure their exchange rates.  Spin-  lattice  relaxation times will be measured to gain dynamical  information over wider ranges in temperature. These  results  for  molecular-scale  dynamics will  be  compared  to  shear  relaxation  times derived from existing data  on  viscosity,  and  to  data  on  electrical conductivity and  diffusivity.  Models  linking  the  microscopic and  macroscopic  will  be  formulated and tested.  %%%  Silicate  and  borosilicate glasses, and their corresponding  high temperature liquids, are of wide-ranging importance  in  industry  and  society.   In  order  to  formulate  accurate  predictive  models for the properties of glasses  and  glass  melts, fundamental data on their atomic-scale structure  and  dynamics  are required.  The work proposed here will  extend  our group's extensive studies of simple silicate glasses and  liquids  to  borate, borosilicate, and boroaluminate-systems  in  order  to address basic, but poorly understood questions  about  these  technologically more relevant  materials.  The  focus  of  this project is to use nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR)  spectroscopy to acquire quantitative  structural   and  dynamical  information at ambient and high temperature,  and  to  interpret  and model existing macroscopic  thermodynamic  and transport property data in light of these new findings.  ***",
