 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mets  9512719  The long term objective of this project is to identify and characterize mechanisms that coordinate the expression of nuclear and organellar genes during the biogenesis of eukaryotic organelles.  This project focuses on nuclear genes that determine the level of expression of a specific chloroplast gene:  the rbcL gene that encodes the large subunit of the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO).  The study will exploit the unique genetic and molecular genetic properties of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  We have developed a strong positive selection for RuBisCO-deficient mutants in C. reinhardtii and will generate a large collection of nuclear gene mutants that fail to produce RuBisCO, but produce normal amounts of other chloroplast gene products.  These mutants will be characterized genetically (by dominance and allelism tests) and mechanistically through molecular studies of rbcL expression.  Preliminary studies on one such mutant, 24DD, suggest that its rbcL mRNA is unstable does not support adequate large subunit synthesis.  Experiments are proposed to confirm and extend these results, to identify and characterize the cis-acting target in the rbcL mRNA that  distinguishes it from other chloroplast messages that are not destabilized in the mutant, and to initiate the cloning and characterization of the mutant gene and its wild type allele.  %%%  The RuBisCO enzyme, whose gene control is under study in this project, is known to be one of the most important elements that limits photosynthetic efficiency, water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency in plants.  Eventual success in correcting of these limitations will depend not only upon understanding its biochemical and metabolic properties but also upon understanding how it's biosynthesis is controlled by the plant.  This project will make a major contribution to that understanding.  ***",
