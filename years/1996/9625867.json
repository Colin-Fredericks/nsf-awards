 "awd_abstract_narration": "Law  9625867    The structure of droplets or the texture of films at liquid  surfaces are indicative of the underlying surface  interaction forces, line tension and surface elasticity. The  understanding of surface interactions is important in many  physical, chemical, and biological processes.  For example,  surface interactions control the phase diagram of Langmuir  films which are frequently used as model systems for  biological membranes, surface interactions also control the  spreading properties of a liquid droplet which is important  in the understanding of lubrication, similarly surface  interactions influence the orientation of liquid crystal  molecules which are used in many modern optical devices.  There are therefore many scientific and technologically  important reasons for studying the structure of droplets and  the texture of films at liquid surfaces.  With this award,  we will develop an improved ellipsometric microscope to  study liquid surface structure.  It overcomes various  technical difficulties associated with a previous  ellipsometric microscope design which could only study thin  films or droplets on solid surfaces.  For isotropic films or  droplets at liquid surfaces the improved ellipsometric  microscope can determine the film thickness as a function of  position with ~0.1 nm thickness resolution and ~1 um spatial  resolution, while for anisotropic films of  known thickness  and composition at a liquid surface the ellipsometric  microscope can determine the variation in film anisotropy  with ~l um spatial resolution.  This instrument will be used  to study the nucleation and growth of wetting droplets as  they coalesce to a uniform wetting film.  The instrument  will also be used to study topological defects in freely  suspended liquid crystal films of known thickness.  The  unbinding of disclinations and dislocations is believed to  play an important role in the 2-D melting process of freely  suspended liquid crystal films.  %%%  As far as we are aware this will be th e first instrument of  its kind which can determine the absolute tilt angle of  anisotropic films with micrometer spatial resolution  (provided the film thickness is known).  This instrument  should therefore prove of general use in many other  situations of interest to the scientific and industrial  community.  For example, it could be used to study tilt  angle transitions and defects in Langmuir films.  It could  also be used in monitoring the quality control of  anisotropic films in an industrial or research setting, for  example, it can quantify the uniformity of hightemperature  superconducting films or Langmuir-Blodgett layers.  ***",
