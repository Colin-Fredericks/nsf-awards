 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527669  Frost  Little Rock Lake was the site of a whole-ecosystem acidification experiment between 1983 and 1990. A wide range of acid responses were documented by comparing the lake's treatment and reference basins. Since 1990 when acid additions stopped, chemical and biological characteristics of the lake's recovery have been evaluated. Chemical features of the lake have largely returned to pre-acidified conditions. By spring 1995, the lake's pH was close to 6.1, the value prior to the manipulation. In contrast, some biological conditions of the lake have proven much less resilient. In particular, the taxonomic composition of the treatment basin's zooplankton community has remained substantially different from the community occurring in the reference basin. Even total zooplankton biomass, which remained nearly equal in the two basins in all but the lowest pH stage of the acidification, has fluctuated widely during recovery. This award will provide funds to continue monitoring the treatment and reference basins of Little Rock Lake. This will allow assessment of whether the zooplankton recovery is simply slower that the lake's chemistry or if the community has been driven to an alternate state which will persist for an extended period of time. The funds will also allow additional small-scale experiments to evaluate some of the mechanisms affecting zooplankton dynamics. Large-scale experiments such as this serve as an interface between applied and theoretical ecology. Continued funding of this project will provide important insights into the specific effects of acidification and into some of the fundamental processes that control ecosystem structure and function.",
