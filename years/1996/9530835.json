 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award to Northern Arizona University will support the   research of Professor Marin S. Robinson.  The research examines the   process by which ice is a scavenger of oxidized and partially oxidized   organic molecules from the gas phase.  Near-grazing angle reflection   spectroscopy is used to examine bulk and surface properties of hydrogen   peroxide uptake onto water-ice films representative of tropospheric ice   clouds. Pure and doped films, as well as films co-deposited with organic   reagents, are studied.  Gas phase oxidation products are monitored using   mass spectrometry.  Condensed phase oxidation products are monitored   using Fourier transform infrared-reflection absorbance spectroscopy.  The   results provide insights regarding the competition between gas phase and   condensed phase oxidation mechanisms.  The research clarifies the role ice plays as a tropospheric scavenger and   aids in interpreting the complex heterogeneous chemistry that takes place   in aqueous cloud droplets.",
