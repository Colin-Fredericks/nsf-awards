 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main emphasis of this research project is to develop  methods for analyzing and predicting mid-frequency vibration  transmission in complex structures, which are assemblages of  connected substructures. Complex structures are a  generalization of periodic and nearly periodic structures.  In the mid-frequency range of vibration for a complex  structure, the vibration wavelengths are small enough for  uncertainties and flaws in the structure to have significant  impact on the global dynamics. The assumptions which  currently limit high-frequency statistical energy methods  are systematically examined and relaxed. This extends their  applicability to more general systems such as those with  strong inter-component coupling. A major thrust in this  research effort is on the elimination of assumptions which  restrict the analysis to the high-frequency range. The  outcome of this research is a hierarchy of new methods for  the vibration analysis of complex structures. These new  methods are valid for both mid-and high-frequency ranges,  reproduce mode localization and related phenomena caused by  uncertainties, which handle moderate and strong coupling  situations, and are relatively simple. The methods developed  are validated through systematic comparison with  experimental data. Simple benchmark experiments (e.g.,  vibration transmission in two coupled plates) are carried  out in the laboratory.",
