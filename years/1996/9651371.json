 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this project is to improve undergraduate education in the psychology department. Specific objectives of the project are to (1) improve the overall teaching of courses in the psychology curriculum, (2) improve the teaching of general scientific principles and methods, (3) improve the teaching of critical thinking skills, and (4) improve student attitudes about science and computer technology. These objectives are being met by creating a computer laboratory capable of sustaining a cohesive sequence of courses in research and statistical methodology in psychology. The laboratory consists of 15 linked computer workstations that contain software specifically designed to enhance learning in a required sequence of courses that convey the principles and content of the scientific study of psychology.   The purpose of this project is to facilitate a shift in the emphasis of undergraduate education in psychology from one of passive (lecture-based) learning to that of active (experiential) learning, by allowing students to explore psychology-related concepts in a hands-on, engaging manner. Furthermore, this project enables students to more easily acquire the skills that will enable them to conduct their own research projects, which will lead to greater enthusiasm toward developing, conducting, analyzing, and reporting psychological research.",
