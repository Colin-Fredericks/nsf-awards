 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    The population of the United States Antarctic Program at McMurdo  Station is approximately one thousand people in the austral  summer.  Untreated sewage is disposed through a macerator and  released into the marine environment as effluent directly  offshore of the station at the twenty meter depth contour.  Although the Principal Investigators have previously mapped the  boundaries of the sewage effluent plume in the water column, the  degree to which anthropogenic sources of organic enrichment is  taken up and passed through the antarctic benthic food web is  unknown.  Coincidentally, the foundation for understanding of the  structure, composition and functioning of antarctic benthic  communities comes primarily from field research conducted within  the boundaries of the McMurdo sewage outfall plume.    The purpose of this research is to determine if sewage-derived  organic material is assimilated by the benthic food web and its  extent of influence and if there is a biological response to  anthropogenic organic enrichment and how this compares to natural  organic enrichment by seals.  This research will provide an  understanding of the relative contribution to natural organic  enrichment by seals.  A secondary purpose  will be to understand  the relative contribution of different organic sources to the  benthos and the way that this material moves through the food  web.  The Principal Investigators will use stable carbon, sulfur,  and nitrogen isotope ratios and fecal-derived bacteria as indices  and compare the influence of sewage and seal-derived organic  matter with natural organic sources from the under-ice, benthos,  and water column.  They will test the hypothesis that sewage  influence is greater than previously thought.  This understanding  is essential for effective station sewage management and policy  decisions and for the design and interpretation of polar benthic  research  conducted in the vicinity of human inhabitation or  other sources of  organic enrichment.",
