 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lichtenbaum        The investigator continues his researcn in the closely related areas  of motives and motivic cohomology.  Having given a definition of mixed m  otives over an algebraically closed field, he extends this definition to  motives over an  arbitrary base scheme.  He then studies the relationship  between the motive of X relative to Y, the motive of Y relative to Z, and  the motive of X relative to Z.  Using his definition of motivic cohomology  in terms of motives, the investigator searches for a proof that this  definition satisfies most, if not all, of the \"axioms\" proposed by  Beilinson and himself.  In particular, the Kummer axiom and the \"finite  dimensionality\" axiom seem to be accessible.  Finally, having already  defined for each variety a homology motive in the category of mixed  motives,the investigator studies possible definitions of motives  corresponding to cohomology, Borel-Moore homology, and cohomology with  compact supports, and explicitly computes these motives in the case of  curves.  The investigator also studies Poincare and Alexander duality for  motives.         This proposal constitutes fundamental research into the basic  structures of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest  parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary  flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its origin, it treated curves in  the plane that could be defined by polynomial equations, generalizing the  classic conic sections known to the Greeks.  Nowadays the field makes use  of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and  conversely is finding application in those fields as well as physics,  theoretical computer science, and robotics.",
