 "awd_abstract_narration": "The retina is the sheet of tissue in the back of the eye that contains the photoreceptor cells and complex network of nerve cells for the first stages of visual processing.  This conference is devoted specifically to how the retina handles information, and includes topics in systems level, cellular, and molecular biology.  Results are compared between vertebrate and invertebrate eyes, between biological and artificial/machine vision, regulation of neural transmission in different parts of the retina, and adaptations to different environments such as polarized light for underwater vision in fish.  Discussion of new findings in these fundamental areas emphasize presentations by young investigators.      Because studies of the anatomy, biochemistry and physiology of the retina have provided numerous models for the way in which nerve cells in the brain handle information flow, this conference is likely to have an impact beyond visual neuroscience alone.  It also will be an important forum for young investigators to exchange ideas with seasoned investigators about topics of very high current interest.",
