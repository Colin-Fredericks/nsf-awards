 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT      Corradini  9633800    The future success of U.S. higher education requires better integration of both teaching scholarship and research scholarship.  Likewise, the future success of the U.S. economy requires that some of our best and brightest young people choose to enter the engineering profession.  In addition, both pedagogical techniques and content knowledge are necessary to prepare effective teachers for engineering classrooms.  To these ends, the University of Wisconsin-Madison proposes to implement a cultural change approach to engineering education that will create an improved, student-centered, problem-based, teach approach to teaching and learning instead of a faculty-centered, traditional approach and that will focus on both research and teaching instead of primarily research.  These goals will be achieved by developing an integrated Engineering Scholars Program (ESP) which will consist primarily of a one-week summer workshop for graduate engineering students and new engineering faculty.  Given the need for curricular and pedagogical reform in engineering and given the high attrition rates of students in engineering, we will focus our attention nationally on engineering graduate students and new faculty, especially women and minorities, interested in pursuing an academic career.  We will collaborate with the engineering coalition schools to recruit and identify thirty participants each year for three years.  Fully aware that our cultural change approach entails a complex and iterative process, our activities will be guided by collaborative, continuous improvement teams of local, on-campus and outside experts who will be responsible for 1) program content that integrates research and teaching, 2) program evaluation and assessment to insure the highest possible program quality and 3) program transition from a dependency on outside experts to a reliance on local experts.  Together with our partners in industry, we propose an innovative, three-year program that will evolve i nto a UW-Madison sponsored program in collaboration with engineering education coalition schools.  Our program will have these major components: 1) workshops for content knowledge about teaching and learning plus hands-on application and a reflective approach, 2) collaborative, cross-disciplinary teams of participants as well as local and outside experts, 3) networking strategies to build collaborative faculty teams at home institutions, 4) a transition plan to move from outside experts to local experts teams, and 5) evaluation, adaption, and dissemination.  ***",
