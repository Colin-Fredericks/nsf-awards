 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the research of Professors Costa and Keller  to study the normal subgroups of the linear, classical and  Chevalley groups over rings. They want to extend the results  already obtained for the special linear and spin groups to the  linear groups of type B, G and F. They also intend to study the  relationship between subgroups of the special linear group of  dimension 2 over a  local field and Hilbert symbols.     This is research in the field of algebra. This area can be  thought of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such,  this area has direct applications to many areas of physics and  chemistry. Moreover, within the last 30 years, many connections  to problems in data transmission have been solved using  techniques from group theory. There are also direct connections  to the error correcting codes that are vital for modern computing  such as working with CD-ROM's as well as to theoretical computer  science in general.",
