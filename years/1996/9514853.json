 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stochastic phenomena, the dynamical effects of thermal and  molecular fluctuations, are of continuing interest in physics and  biology. Our approach involves theory, numerical simulations and  contact with experiments.  In one part of the research, quantum  mechanical consequences of chaotic dynamics in classical systems  will be studied.  Classical measures of fluctuation amplification  by chaos, such as Lyapunov exponents, can be related to the  growth rate of quantum variances in systems that can be described  both classically and quantally.  This connection will be explored  in the context of magneto-optically trapped cesium atom  experiments.  This work leads to a reevaluation of fundamental  classical concepts such as point and trajectory that turn out to  be unstable characteristics of chaotic systems.  In another part  of the research, stochastic properties of the propagation of  action potentials along neurons is explored.  These studies  provide a first principles account of ion channel fluctuations  and their affects on action potential propagation, timing, and  interspike statistics, each of which has been recently  highlighted as of importance for the information coding problem  in neuronal signals.  The fluctuations cause spontaneous firing  patterns that have been measured and which will be compared with  numerical simulations of a stochastic theory.",
