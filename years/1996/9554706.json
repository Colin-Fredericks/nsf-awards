 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thrust of this project is to attack problems faced by  institutions of providing a high quality introductory computer  science curriculum while developing strategies to better utilize  the potential of student interaction in their learning process.   This project brings together a diverse group of 30 computer science  educators for an ongoing process in the application of peer  learning to the introductory areas of Computer Science education.  Invited participants will address problems of teaching introductory  courses by this peer learning process (ie., students learning in  collaboration, and with some faculty guidance).  This forum  provides a hands-on environment for using and developing activities  with this method.  Outcomes from the work include the instructional  materials produced along with a common assessment of their  application to the faculty members home Computer Science program.  A final report will be produced at a follow-up workshop in the 2nd  year, and made widely available to the CS community through the  WWW.",
