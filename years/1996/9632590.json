 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is on the design and synthesis of new N-donor   ligands and metal complexes of varying structure and symmetry to develop   new stereoselective reactions and to study the scope and mechanism of   selected enantioselective processes.  Specific reactions to be studied   include the catalytic oxidation of alkenes to allylic benzoates by   perbenzoate esters using copper promoters, catalytic aziridination of   alkenes by copper complexes, C-C bond forming reactions promoted by   lanthanide complexes and C-H and C-C bond activations promoted by rhodium   compounds.  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting   the research of Dr. William B. Tolman of the Department of Chemistry at   the University of Minnesota.  Professor Tolman will focus his work on   testing the efficacy of C3-symmetry in metal promoted enantioselective   chemistry.  Successful methodology will have an impact on synthesis in   the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.",
