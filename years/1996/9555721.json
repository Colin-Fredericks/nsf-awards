 "awd_abstract_narration": "9555721  Rees  This project is designed to transform both earth science courses and pedagogy for the  teaching of the social science of geolog\" will be developed and implemented.  The  new courses and pedagogy will help to reform the earth science courses, teaching  methods, and the classroom environment to make science inviting for traditionally  marginalized students, particularly women; place the study of earth systems in a social  and historical context; examine the race, class, and gender dynamics that shape  scientific knowledge; illuminate the relationship between science, politics, and social  policy; develop truly interdisciplinary social science of geology courses by  incorporating the knowledge of the natural and social sciences.    The goals of the reformed curricula and pedagogy are to (1) attract and retain  underrepresented groups m earth science programs, (2) place the study of earth  systems in a social and historical context from high school through university, (3)  enhance both educators' and students' understanding( of natural and social systems  and their inter-relatedness and (4) increase social and scientific literacy. New  resources will be incorporated into newly created thematic modules that will illuminate  natural and social systems and their inter-relatedness; examine the race, class, and  gender dimensions of scientific inquiry and knowledge; and stimulate students to apply  their personal knowledge of the natural and social sciences to local and environmental  issues and policy making endeavors.  The modules will contain pedagogical  recommendations and suggestions; suggested readings, laboratory exercises,  community-based activities, and field-trip localities; and extensive resource guides.    In order to recruit and retain more women to science disciplines, new classroom  resources and teaching methods should be used.  This project will enhance the  teaching of earth sciences by looking at the interelatedness of nature and society and  at the ways science is rel evant to the lives of a diverse student population.  Teaching  materials and plans will help high school, community college, and university faculty  improve the content of their courses.  ***",
