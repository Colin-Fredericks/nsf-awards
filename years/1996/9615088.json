 "awd_abstract_narration": "A formal method consists of a well-defined specification  language and a rigorously defined set of rules that can be  used to reason about the specifications expressed in that  language. The specification language is used to describe the  intended system behavior. In order to facilitate the use of  formal methods for software development, particularly for  high-assurance systems, the objective of this project is to  produce a set of integrated techniques that support the use  of formal methods for all phases of software development.  Towards this end, several new techniques and tools are being  developed that support the application of formal methods for  software engineering. These include tools to support correct  program derivation from formal specifications, to formally  specify requirements analysis and design information, to  determine software reuse based on formal specifications, to  reverse engineer existing software to obtain formal  descriptions, and to statically analyze requirements  specifications for completeness and consistency.    Formal specifications can be checked for consistency and  completeness using automated techniques. However, during the  initial phases of a project, it may be difficult to  construct formal specifications directly. In contrast, many  developers find it more intuitive to create diagrams to  model their systems.    As a means to bridge the gap between formal and informal  approaches to software development, this research  investigates the formalization of a commonly used modeling  notation, known as the Object Modeling Technique. The  notation comprises three complementary diagrams: object  (entity-relation) diagrams, state diagrams, and data flow  diagrams. These three diagrams, respectively, model the  architecture (static), behavior (dynamic), and data flow and  services of a given system. The results of the formalization  studies will enable the automated generation of formal  specifications from diagrams. The next step is to  investigate and develop  formal semantics for the integration  of the three models. Finally, design transformations are  studied that can be applied to the diagrams and the  corresponding specifications.  ***",
