 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is the development of enhanced service options  for low bit rate video applications to improve their transmission over  packet based wireless channels. The encoding process will be studied in  detail to better understand the underlying characteristics of the service.  This research will draw on expertise gained from previous work in the area  of variable bit rate video transmission over ATM based BISDN networks.  Current work will focus on the H.263 standard which encompasses a very  complex encoding process that incorporates several different options. The  impact of these options on the transmission of video data over a packet  based wireless channel has not yet been studied extensively. The research  plan involves studying the different encoding options and then  investigating network access and error recovery schemes for the  transmission of packetized video data.  The orthogonal frequency division  multiplexing and multicarrier modulation (OFDM and MCM) wireless  transmission schemes and antenna diversity strategy studied are interesting  for video applications because of the flexibility with which channel  resources may be dynamically allocated for layered video coding  transmission.  Nonlinear receiver structures and nonlinear processing for  image quality enhancement to combat the effects of interference on video  quality will also be studied.  The research project includes the set-up of  a wireless testbed that will be housed in both the Signal Processing  Research Laboratory and the Video Processing and Telecommunications  Laboratory.  The testbed will be used to conduct experiments on indoor  wireless video transmission.",
