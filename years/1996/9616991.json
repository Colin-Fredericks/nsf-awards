The mission of the proposed Center is to support basic research on the use of human language technology to create better tools and strategies for learning.  Areas of research and tool development will include using speech as an input modality in computer assisted learning;  speech training for second language learning or articulation training; speech as a primary input modality for physically challenged individuals;  and speech as a context for learning about other things.",
