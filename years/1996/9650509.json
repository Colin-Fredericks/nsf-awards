 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Materials Science and Engineering is introducing a new integrated laboratory course sequence on Phase Analysis in Materials. To implement this course, project leaders are obtaining an energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy system, with the associated NIST desktop spectrum analyzer software for an existing desktop student scanning electron microscope, and an automation and analysis package for the undergraduate Philips x-ray powder diffractometer.   These instruments can be used in conjunction with automated mechanical testing (Instron) and thermal analysis (DTA/DSC/TGA) systems in a number of experiments to provide an integrated program that applies equally to metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites. The instrumentation enables the department to make innovative and cost-effective use of existing resources to perform newer and more extensive experiments, conduct more refined analysis of experimental data, enhance the department's capacity to provide students hands-on phase analysis experience using state-of-the-art methods, and better prepare those students for the modern industrial environment. It can also augment the ongoing outreach program with area high school teachers, students, and underrepresented minorities.   The integrated approach to materials problem solving is both novel and crucial to materials engineering education. With this approach, students can readily understand the trade-offs between ease of processing and performance in terms of materials phenomena and differences in microstructure, which contributes substantially to the design component of a materials program. The proposed laboratory sequence on phase analysis adds a significant new dimension to the curriculum and substantially affects student/graduate engineer performance in the co-op/work environment, which should lead to overall enhancement in industrial output. The course may serve as a model for other materials engineering programs in the Nation.",
