The aim of this project is to  make progress in settling some of these problems, mainly by creating  new constructions of topological spaces.  The principal technique to  be used has its origin in a paper of M.E.Rudin, where an example of a  normal but not collectionwise normal simplicial complex is constructed.  In that paper Rudin uses countable substructures of a structure of  size 2^c on a set of cardinality c (= the cardinality of the real  line) to code normality.  Refinements of and improvements on this  technique will be used to attack seven problems from the literature as  well as to obtain related results.  A typical such problem is whether  and which normal, screenable (= every open cover has a sigma-disjoint  open refinement) spaces are paracompact.       The following two important properties of the usual Euclidean  space are often used in mathematics.  (1) Every continuous function on  a closed set can be continuously extended over the entire space  (normality).  (2) Continuous local structures can be continuously  amalgamated into global ones (paracompactness).  Research during and  before the early fifties showed that many of the more general types of  spaces used in mathematical applications also have one or both of  these properties; those that do are called, respectively, normal and  paracompact spaces.  Major breakthroughs in the seventies and eighties  uncovered much of the structure of normal and paracompact spaces.  However, basic research questions remain unanswered.  Such questions  are typically concrete, explicit conjectures in the literature that  have to do with problems such as these: (a ) How does one recognize  paracompact spaces in the class of normal spaces?  (b) Does the  product of two or more normal spaces of a certain kind also have this  useful extension property?  During the course of this project,  refinements of a technique originated by M.E.Rudin will be used to  build general topological spaces, with the goal of settling some of the  conjectures mentioned above.  ***",
