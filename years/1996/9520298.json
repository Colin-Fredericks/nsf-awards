 "awd_abstract_narration": "The choice of primitive coordination operations, whether  reading and writing a shared memory, message-passing, or  more complex operations, has become a crucial design issue.  To make such choices, one must analyze the behavior of multi-  process executions, reasoning about the multitude of  possible combinations of concurrent operations. This is an  unusually delicate and laborious task. The goal of this  research is to replace this need to argue about concurrent  executions with combinatorial conditions on the geometric  representation of problems. This should allow researchers  and designers, instead of analyzing behaviors, to apply  powerful mathematical tools to recognize when certain  protocols are impossible, to evaluate the power of  alternative synchronization primitives, or to make explicit  the assumptions needed to make a given problem solvable.    This project pursues the problem of characterizing and  classifying the power of synchronization primitives in  different models. Prior research has developed powerful new  tools based on classical topology for analyzing fault-  tolerant concurrent alogrithms and data structures in a  variety of models and architectures. This research has shown  that a large class of synchronization problems can be  associated with a high-dimensional geometric structure  called a simplicial complex, and that the computational  complexity of solving the problem using a given underlying  architecture is captured by certain topological properties  of the complex. These properties have been used to give a  complete characterization of the synchronization problems  solvable in asynchronous read/write memory, and to provide  impossiblity results and lower bounds for several known open  problems in both the asynchronous model and in the  synchronous message-passing model. These techniques are  being applied toward a comprehensive theory of  multiprocessor synchronization.  ***",
