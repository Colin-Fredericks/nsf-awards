Invaders   represent a major but poorly understood global change element.  This   proposal would start a process with the following foci:  the development of   a new protocol to quantify the changing presence of invaders in carefully   matched managed and natural ecosystems in the western Americas, extending   from the subarctic to the true deserts; the development of new approaches   for assessing the impacts of the invaders in both environmental and   holistic economic terms; and the preparation of a Phase II proposal for the   establishment of a research network in the Americas to apply the new tools   developed and to promote the development of new research expertise.  For some biota, there is relatively good information on the numbers of   species of invaders in given regions, and to a certain extent, how these   numbers are changing through time.  To a larger degree though, there is not   much information on the abundance of invaders, their population dynamics,   or their particular and total environmental impacts.   There is virtually   no fine structure of information on the changing abundance of invaders   through time or how many invaders remain at low levels of abundance, for   how long, and when they may suddenly increase in abundance as climate, land   use, or management practices change.  This proposal will try to fill these   information gaps through a planning meeting in Phase I to develop a Phase   II proposal for the study and analysis of, and predictions about the   biological invaders.  Specifically, Phase I will develop a research plan which addresses the   following areas:  assessing the current knowledge and information gaps on   the distribution of invasive species; assessing the available information   for invasive species patterns affecting international trade, quarantine   control, and commercialization of flo ra and fauna; developing criteria and   methodologies for rapid field assessments of invasion patterns of exotic   species in different ecosystems and under different types of management;   developing criteria for selection of field sites so as to represent   different land-use patterns and the main natural vegetation types;   developing criteria to determine relevant experimental work for determining   predictions about the long-term impacts on difficult invasive species;   developing methods to assess impacts of species on ecosystem functions;   assessing the sort-term and long-term manpower and institutional   requirements in the participating institutions to undertake the project   successfully; initiating discussion on how to value the impacts of invasive   species in both economic and environmental contexts; and establishing   mechanisms for evaluation of the progress of the project, data sharing,   communications, publication of results, and making results available to   managers and government agencies.  %%%  Invading organisms often cause enormous economic and environmental impact,   resulting in the disruption of many earth systems processes.  Invaders   represent a major but poorly understood global change element.  This   proposal would start a process with the following foci:  the development of   a new protocol to quantify the changing presence of invaders in carefully   matched managed and natural ecosystems in the western Americas, extending   from the subarctic to the true deserts; the development of new approaches   for assessing the impacts of the invaders in both environmental and   holistic economic terms; and the preparation of a Phase II proposal for the   establishment of a research network in the Americas to apply the new tools   developed and to promote the development of new research expertise.  One of the largest, but perhaps least recognized elements of global change   is the increasing homogenization of the world's biota.  We are witnessing a   massive exchange of b iological material between previously isolated   continents and regions.  Although many of these exchanges are purposeful   and beneficial to human endeavors, they may do tremendous harm to the   productive capacity of natural and managed ecosystems.  Furthermore, they   can alter fire and nutrient regimes, water quality and quantity, sediment   movement, forest regeneration, as well as disrupt genetic systems and   fragment or homogenized biotic communities and habitats.  One reason   introductions can be so detrimental is that their population densities can   be far higher in new areas than in their native habitats, because they are   often removed from their natural controls in their new homes.  Because of   the potential ecological and economic consequences of invaders, both good   and bad, there is a great need for knowledge on the biology, origins,   movement and fates of invaders in order to develop predictive tools for   evaluating their potential success and impacts in any given region.  This proposal will address the information on the characteristics, impacts   and controls of invading species which have relevance for local national   and international policy-makers.  Therefore, this proposal includes   participants from the following countries:  Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and   the United States.  These countries are Members States of the   Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI), a U.S.   initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global change issues among   the scientific institutions of the Americas.  The U.S. National Science   Foundation is the U.S. Government agency designated to carry out U.S.   responsibilities within the IAI.  ***        --========================_13392216==_--",
