 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514816     Dohanich    The neural basis for the development of learning and memory is  currently unclear. However, studies have implicated the cholinergic  nerve network in the brain as being an integral chemical component  of the process of learning and memory.  Recent investigations noted  that gonadal hormones, particularly estrogen, may participate in  these complex behaviors, especially during advancing age. The  investigations of Dr. Dohanich will establish the linkage between  these chemical messenger molecules in learning and memory across  the ages.  As part of these investigations, the experiments will  characterize the hormonal conditions that affect performance in  tasks of learning and memory, particularly following the compromise  of the cholinergic system.  Further innovative investigations will  elucidate the interrelationship of the environment, either simple  or complex, with the hormonal milieu in the development of learning  and memory.  Unfortunately, ample basic information regarding the  complex interactions of the brain chemical messenger molecules and  the environment has precluded a clear understanding of the  development of learning and memory behaviors.  The present  investigations will foster greater understanding of these critical  behaviors. Moreover, the role of the environment in learning has  been proposed but critical investigations have not been undertaken.   These studies will be among the first to generate quantifiable data  on the role of the environment in information processing in  biological systems.",
