The  objective is to elucidate protein-protein interactions  in  these  artificial self assemblies and to develop a new class of advanced  materials consisting of functionalized interfaces manipulated  at  the  molecular  level.  This should lead  to  advanced  materials  useful  in  optical,  separations,  chemical  sensors,  and  high  temperature catalysis applications. We will explore the structure  and  hydrogel  behavior  in a newly invented  class  of  lamellar  hydrogels    based   on   fluid   membranes   and    end-anchored  polymer-lipids.  \"bioactive  lamellar  gels\"  useful  in   tissue  healing  or  drug  delivery applications will be  developed  with  activity derived from biomolecules and mechanical stability  from  the polymer-lipid component.  %%%  This project seeks to develop a new class of materials consisting  of   multilayers  of  functionalized  interfaces  which  can   be  manipulated  at  the  molecular level. The  components  of  these  materials will consist of surfactants (surface active molecules),  proteins,  and  peptides.  The  materials  should  be  useful  in  molecular  separations and purification technologies,  biological  and chemical sensors technologies, and high temperature catalysis  applications. A new class of recently invented hydrogels invented  in  this  laboratory will be explored further. The lamellar  gels  are  made  from liquid phases by the addition of water, a  highly  unusual  behavior. Because the gels contains no  solid  component  they   have  the  potential  of  incorporating  combinations   of  biologically active molecules. We will explore the development of  \"bioactive   lamellar   gels\"   useful   in   artificial   tissue  development,   in   tissue   healing,   and   in   drug   delivery  applications.  ***",
