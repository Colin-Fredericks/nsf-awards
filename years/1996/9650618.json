 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, entitled Improvement of the Chemistry Curriculum and Laboratory Program for Minority Students, is designed to upgrade the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at this university. For this goal, new instrumentation is being purchased and its use integrated into the classroom and laboratory curricula. The chemistry program was developed to introduce modern laboratory techniques at all levels of instruction, to aid in the learning of many concepts presented in the classroom through hands-on experience, and to expand the undergraduate research program. The specific laboratory programs affected by the project include physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, organic chemistry, and courses in instrumental analysis.    Implementation of this project permits the introduction of additional modern experimental procedures in the upper-division laboratory program and provides needed instrumentation for student research projects including talented high school students involved in special projects. Project implementation affects all chemistry majors and students who take organic chemistry as a requirement in their majors such as biology, medical technology, and premedical students.   The main outcome of this project is the strengthening of the basic undergraduate curriculum in chemistry through an improvement in the resources that are available to the students. The project affects approximately 150 students each year including the chemistry majors. The improvement results in a better prepared graduate of the campus who, in turn, is better motivated and prepared to continue graduate studies or to work in the local industries or government. The project is also in line with the priorities of AMERICA 2000, especially with the objective of increasing the number of minorities and women who complete degrees in science, given that 59 percent of the students are female and 98 percent, minorities.",
