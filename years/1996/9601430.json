 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601430  Gilboy  This study explores a recent dramatic change in U.S. efforts to combat clandestine immigration through the regulation of international airlines. In the past, airlines operated under a stringent liability system in which regardless of the thoroughness of their screening they were subject to stiff sanctions if they transported an inadequately documented traveler. In October 1994, however, these screening laws were significantly relaxed.      In exploring this recent policy change the study has two objectives. First, it examines the debate between international airlines and the U.S. Immigration Service over airline responsibility for illegal travelers. The research describes and analyzes the differing perspectives about airline responsibility for illegal travelers such as asylum seekers who board planes with forged documents, destroy them on route, and then claim asylum once they have arrived.  Second, it explores the sources of the recent legislative change, focusing on the context in which the legislative policy shift occurred. The study examines several explanations (economic concerns, political interests, transnational forces, ideas about deregulation and private enforcement) for the congressional decision to change the century old approach to carrier regulation. Canada, where relaxation of stringent laws also occurred recently, will provide a useful additional case to begin to refine and elaborate the model.      This analysis of clandestine immigration and its control through the use of international airlines will contribute to our understanding of the fundamental issue of public and private domains and the role of law in their articulation.   %%%%",
