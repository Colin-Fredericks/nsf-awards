 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514803  Belas  Proteus mirabilis exhibits the unique ability to undergo a morphological and physiological differentiation to form a swarmer cell in response to growth on surfaces or in viscous fluids. Maintenance of the differentiated cell requires constant contact with the inducing environment and is mediated through conditions that inhibit rotation of the flagella. A second signal, the amino acid glutamine, is also critical for induction of differentiation. Moreover, swarmer cells respond specifically to glutamine concentration gradients, while undifferentiated swimmer cells do not. While differentiation into a swarmer cell occurs at the level of the individual cell, swarming motility and behavior are characteristics associated with the coordinated movement of groups of swarmer cells. This behavior is cyclic in nature, so that the movement of the swarming mass is punctuated by periodic episodes during which the bacteria cease movement and dedifferentiate from the swarmer cell back to the swimmer cell in a process called consolidation. The cycles of swarming and consolidation are then repeated several times until the agar surface is covered by concentric rings giving rise to the characteristic \"bull's-eye\" appearance of P. mirabilis colonies.  TnS mutagenesis has produced two general categories of mutants defective in swarming: null mutants (Swr-) in which swarming does not occur and mutants that show aberrant swarming behavior (Swrcr).  Swrcr mutants do not produce \"bull's-eye\" consolidation patterns. Instead, many of these mutants are altered in their ability to form discrete consolidation zones of uniform size and are called pattern-determining mutants. We have developed two hypotheses to explain the control of pattern formation, each having a different set of predictions and anticipated genes. The first hypothesis argues that the cycles are generated by an internal 'clock' where the increase or decrease of some intracellular component is crucial in determining when consolidation occurs. In  contrast to the 'clock' model, the second hypothesis suggests that the cycles of consolidation are generated by an extracellular system of molecules, i.e., extracellular concentration gradients control the cycles. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive (and are not the only models that one can develop), but are useful for making predictions.  Moreover, the 'clock' model suggests a temporal control of pattern formation while an extracellular concentration gradient hypothesis implicates a spatial control mechanism. This framework lends itself to the development tests to prove the efficacy of each model and predicts the involvement of certain gene products.  This research will test the hypothesis that these pattern-determining mutants have arisen from mutations affecting the spatial or temporal coordination of multicellular migration and consolidation.  The research seeks to gain insights into the mechanisms of pattern determination by: a) Identifying swarming-pattern-determining genes and their functions through nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence analysis and b) Determining the differential expression of pattern-determining genes at discrete time points during swarming behavior. To accomplish these goals known, previously constructed Tn5 mutants defective in multicellular migration and pattern formation will be used. The disrupted genes will be cloned from each mutant, the nucleotide sequence analyzed, and the putative function of the encoded protein determined by homology to known genes in the database.  P. mirabilis merodiploids will be constructed to produce transcriptional fusions with bacterial luciferase (luxCDABE), to measure temporal control mechanisms, while translational fusions with (-galactosidase (lacZ) will measure spatial control during pattern formation. The completion of these objectives will provide knowledge of fundamental importance to molecular biologists, and may offer insight into how multicellular movement is regulated during both prokaryotic and eukary otic development.  ***",
