 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526795  Davis    One of the major challenges facing hydrogeologists today is the prediction of solute movement in the subsurface.  It has been generally recognized that the spatial variation of aquifer permeability is one of the dominant controls on the evolution of a contaminant plume.  In addition, recent studies suggest that the spatial variation in aquifer chemical properties may also influence solute movement.  One very promising approach to quantifying  subsurface variability and the associated contaminant transport is the geostatistical approach.  Geostatistical, or stochastic, models represent aquifer properties with spatially correlated random field.  In recent years, a wide variety of statistical models have been proposed in the literature to represent the spatial variation of permeability. Some of these models have also been applied to the spatial variation of chemical properties.  In general, each model is based on a different method for mathematically representing, or computationally generating, spatially correlated random variables and each  exhibits overall differences in appearance.  This research investigates how the various statistical models relate to the geological processes of deposition and how geologic information can be used to select and parameterize the most appropriate model.  Results from previous work indicate that a quantifiable relationship exists between the sedimentological features of fluvial bounding surfaces and the geostatistical properties of modality and spatial correlation.  Fluvial bounding surfaces are hierarchical in nature and it has been observed that, in general, the higher the order of the bounding surface, the higher the probability that the surface separates regions with different mean permeability.  The regions of different mean permeability in turn are the dominant control on modality and spatial correlation structure of the statistical models of heterogeneity.  With regard to the spatial variation of aquifer chemical properties, very little fi eld data on the spatial patterns of variability.  This research will obtain important data on the nature of chemical heterogeneity and its relationship to the geological processes of deposition.  The primary objectives of the proposed research are to: 1) empirically investigate the relationship between the correlation structure of permeability and the spatial distribution of hierarchical bounding surfaces; 2) investigate the relationship between the spatial variation of chemical properties and geologic features; and 3) develop an algorithm for coding sedimentological information of depositional environment for the simulation of the physical and chemical heterogeneity.  The first phase will investigate the spatial variation of both permeability and chemical properties (mineralogy, grain coatings, surface area, porosity, and cation-exchange capacity) of deposits exposed in New England gravel pits.  The results of the field work will be used to develop an algorithm of simulating aquifer heterogeneity.  It is anticipated that the algorithm will treat different scales of heterogeneity separately using the indicator formalism and Bayesian statistics.    Each geologic setting is unique and any particular outcrop study will not be directly transportable to other sites.  However, if the physical and chemical heterogeneity can be related to general geologic properties and sedimentological features, the results of this research will enable much more portability between different geologic settings.",
