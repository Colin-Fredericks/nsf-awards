 "awd_abstract_narration": "The core of the proposal consists of two broad projects relating to the analysis and design of monetary policy. The objective of the first project is to extend and apply my earlier work on the use of \"semi-structural\" vector autoregression (VAR) methods to measure the stance of monetary policy and the effects of monetary shocks on the economy. Among the planned extensions are 1) the use of these methods to study monetary policy in countries other than the United States; 2) empirical analyses of the 3-6 month \"impact effect\" of monetary policy on the economy, and of the role of money in general cyclical dynamics; and 3) a study of the effects of monetary policy on financial and real decisions in a large panel of manufacturing firms.     The second project studies the increasingly popular strategy of \"inflation targeting\". One component of this project will be a set of six case studies, which will document in some detail the adoptimn, implementation, and results of various forms of inflation targeting in Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. The goal of the case studies is to draw practical lessons about institutional arrangements, political preconditions, etc., that affect the likelihood of success. The qualitative analysis will be supplemented by a more formal econometric examination of the effects of adopting inflation targets on inflation expectations, monetary policy actions, and the behavior of inflation itself. In separate theoretical papers I will also address 1) the relative advantages of inflation targeting and money targeting for central banks with imperfect credibility and 2) the feasibility and desirability of targeting private-sector inflation forecasts, rather than inflation per se.     Two additional empirical projects will 1) test the implication of the neoclassical growth model that a country's rate of TFP growth is strictly exogenous and 2) investigate whether the worldwide monetary contraction of the 1930s can be rationalized as a switch am ong multiple equilibria",
