 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514389  Begenisich    Most, if not all, physiological processes require the  movements of ions across the membrane of the cells.  The  pathways for these ion movements are channels, or pores,  formed by proteins imbedded in the membrane.  Some of these  proteins pores are specialized to allow potassium ions to  pass through the membrane very selectively.  Potassium ion  flow has many critical physiological roles for the normal  functioning of the nervous system, as well as the generation  and modulation of rhythmic electrical activity in the heart  and other organs. With such diverse and important roles it  is not surprising that these proteins are the targets of  many biological and pharmacological agents.  Although the  structure of some potassium channels is now understood, the  specific biophysical  mechanisms by which the channels  achieve their very high degree of ion selectivity and the  details of how ions pass through the channels remains  largely unknown.  This project employs molecular cloning  techniques to express potassium channels in oocytes, where  the currents through the channels are detected with modern  electrophysiological techniques.       The basic research funded by this award enhances the  understanding of fundamental, molecular  properties of ion  permeation through the use of cloned potassium channel  proteins.",
