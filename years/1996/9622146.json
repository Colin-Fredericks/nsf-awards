 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622146  Reimanis  This Research Equipment Grant will allow the Center for Advanced  Ceramics at the Colorado School of Mines to purchase a high vacuum  hot press which is essential for several research projects in  Ceramic Engineering and in Materials Science.  This equipment is  clearly needed by the investigator to develop fully-dense ceramics  for research studies on ceramics and composites.  The research  studies on ceramic synthesis and metal/ceramic functionally graded  materials are important and novel research topics.  PI has a strong  record of quality research and has demonstrated competence in his  studies of the failure of ceramics.  In addition to research  studies the equipment will be available to undergraduate students  for educational purposes.  The institutional cost-share of 50% of  the project costs will come from a State of Colorado capital  equipment grant for the renovation and construction of the  Metallurgical and Materials Engineering building at the Colorado  school of Mines.  ***",
