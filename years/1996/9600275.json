The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Robbie J. Iuliucci to work with  Professor B. H. Meier at the University of Nijmegen in the  Netherlands.        The aim of this project is to study the 3D structural  aspects of molecules and their interaction in the solid  phase via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).  The most useful  NMR interactions for this purpose in spin 1/2 systems are  chemical shielding and dipolar interactions.  Dr. Iuliucci's  background is in chemical shift anisotropy and Dr. Meier's  expertise is with polarization transfer experiments.  Together they will advance the understanding of solid state  NMR.  The University of Nijmegan's lab had two new solid  state NMR spectrometers working at 400 MHz and 300 MHz and  has access to a 180 MHz solid state spectrometer and a 500,  600 and 750 MHz Bruker spectrometers with solids  capabilities.  In addition, they have numerous NMR probes,  including high spinning speed double and triple magic angle  spinning, probes, high field static cross polarization,  probes, a double rotation, probe, and a dynamic angle  spinning, probe, that enable most solid state NMR  experiments.  ***",
