The subject is important  because a significant fraction, on the order of 10s of %, of  total marine primary productivity passes through the viral  \"compartment.\" While it has been assumed that this matter is  utilized by bacteria, there have been no studies of the  actual fates of this material nor of the rates with which it  is transformed or decomposed. This project will use a  combination of laboratory and field studies to determine the  fates of viral matter and cell debris released when viruses  lyse an organism, and the rates by which this matter travels  through different routes in the microbial food web. A major  method to be used is radiolabelling of the products of viral  infection, purification of the products, and then addition  to fresh seawater. The project will examine the interactions  with bacteria, phytoplankton, and other protists. Of  particular interest is the variability of these processes,  within communities and between different times and places.  It is also proposed to develop an approach to label natural  viruses with colloidal gold and then use an electron  microscopy-based analysis analogous to \"isotope dilution\" to  estimate simultaneously the production and loss rates of  each labelled viral morphological type. The information  should improve our ability to form conceptual and numerical  models of marine microbial food webs. It also should prove  useful in the more general study of the turnover of marine  dissolved organic matter (to which viruses operationally  belong), which now appears to be of considerable  significance in global geochemical cycles.  ***",
