 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experience with the structural determination abilities of infrared (IR) and the trace elemental analysis capabilities of atomic spectroscopy (AS) are essential parts of any chemist's training. Unfortunately, the obsolete condition and unreliability of the college's instrumentation has made instruction difficult in these areas. This project involves purchase of a modern Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) source. These instruments are being integrated into the laboratory components of several analytical chemistry courses using modem teaching methodologies. The focus of the project is to develop an industrial/environmental cluster of experiments that run through the current freshman-, sophomore-, and junior-level chemistry courses. Experiments within this cluster are based upon the case study method, involve the use of one or both of the new instruments, and focus on issues involving environmental quality. This approach better prepares chemistry, biochemistry, and biology students by involving them in real-world problems and by providing hands-on experience using modern analytical instrumentation. Case studies can be written in a manner that allows other colleges and universities to adapt these methods readily. The project's educational impact can be evaluated by measuring students' attitudes. These measurements can be made using psychological survey instruments that allow detailed statistical analysis to be performed.",
