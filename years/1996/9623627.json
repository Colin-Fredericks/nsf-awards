 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623627  Lauder    Natural  selection  is  believed  to  maintain  symmetry  in  vertebrate  jaws because any deviation from  symmetry  would  negatively  affect  the  ability to acquire  food.  Yet,  as  adults, flatfish have morphologically asymmetrical jaws  and  might  exhibit asymmetrical prey capture. This project  will  determine if and how functional asymmetry is produced in two  flatfish    species   using   high-speed   video   analysis,  morphological  description,  electromyography,  and   three-  dimensional modeling of jaw mechanisms. Preliminary  results  indicate  that  one  flatfish species produces  asymmetrical  gape  and bending of the jaws out of the midline during prey  capture.  However, another species does not  experience  jaw  bending  or  asymmetrical gape. This project will  focus  on  modifying  current two-dimensional models to produce  three-  dimensional  models which can accurately predict  functional  asymmetry.  Models generated will be used in the  future  to  predict  prey  capture  behavior  in  other  flatfishes  and  applied to symmetrical fishes to gain a better understanding  of  the three-dimensional nature of prey capture mechanisms.  This  project will add to our understanding of morphological  diversity,  and  related diversity in the capture  of  prey,  that can exist in an important group of organisms.",
