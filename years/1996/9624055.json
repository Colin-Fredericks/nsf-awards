These  are a relatively easily controlled and geometrically well defined  class   of   `confined'   liquids,  whose   properties   can   be  significantly different from those of bulk liquids. Systems to be  studied  include thin films of concentrated metal salt solutions,  spreading  films of viscous liquids, and wetting films  on  solid  substrates.  The structures within and normal to the  film  plane  are  to  be  probed as functions of film thickness,  temperature,  solute  concentration, and applied potential. The  investigations  are  of  fundamental  interest and are relevant  to  applications  involving not only lubrication, wetting, and  spreading, but also  to  other  confined systems such as liquids in  droplets,  porous  minerals, capillaries, and biological cells.  %%%     This  project  investigates  the  structural  arrangement   of  molecules within very thin liquid films. Synchrotron radiation is  used  to measure the structure as it can be quite different  from  bulk  liquids. The properties of liquids change when they are  in  the  form  of  very thin films or in other `confined' geometries.  The  investigation is not only of basic interest but  is  related  wetting and spreading processes (such as occur in painting or oil  spills),   and  related  industrial  processes.  The  information  obtained  is  likely  to lead to a better  understanding  of  the  properties of other confined systems such as droplets in a cloud,  oil   in  porous  rocks,  and  fluids  in  biological  cells  and  capillaries.  ***",
