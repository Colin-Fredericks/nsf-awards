 "awd_abstract_narration": "IRI-9625041       The research goal of this project is to develop intelligent  robots that combine cognitive capabilities such as reasoning and  language with sophisticated perceptual and motor capabilities in  a natural manner.  The project builds on previous work by  extending a real-time visual routine processing system to handle  the tracking of multiple deformable objects and developing an  agent architecture that provides the ability to pass parameters  and represent the world in terms of high-level semantic  constructs as in conventional knowledge representation languages  but also retains the circuit-level parallelism and reactivity of  behavior-based and connectionist systems.  These technologies are  being developed in the context of implementing useful  functionality such as message and package delivery, and following  high level instructions. The educational goal of this project is  to work toward a unified first-year engineering curriculum that  teaches physics concepts together with supporting skills in  mathematics and computer science and relates these concepts  immediately to engineering practice by allowing students to build  intelligent mechatronic devices such as robots.",
