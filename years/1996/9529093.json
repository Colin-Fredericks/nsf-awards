 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Stang at the   University of Utah will investigate the chemistry of molecular squares.   The recent discovery of these complexes by the principal investigator   provides the basis for this award. In this endeavor the dynamic chemistry   as well as the synthesis of new models will be investigated. Molecular   squares that are derived from the self-assembly of organometallic and   inorganic complexes are unique materials. They are proposed to be useful   for general catalysis, chiral catalysis, molecular recognition and   electronic devices. An electron rich cavity of 20-30 angstroms within the   squares may provide a unique host-guest system for catalysis. An attempt   shall be made to incorporate a myriad of transition metals at the corners   of the square to provide new electronic and three dimensional   characteristics.  New molecular structures prepared by scientists often provide for new   materials and material properties. In addition to yielding new practical   applications, these new systems stimulate others to expand on the   paradigm to produce unique compounds and chemistry. This project results   from an initial discovery by the principal investigator and has gained   considerable momentum of late. It promises to have significant impact on   catalysis, molecular recognition, and ultimately nanoscale molecular   devices.",
