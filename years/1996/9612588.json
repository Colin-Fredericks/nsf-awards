Utilizes three basic types of mentoring for young women --       first-year research internships, linking faculty mentors with       students; peer mentoring, using upper level women science       majors as mentors for first year students; and electronic       mentoring, matching undergraduate and graduate women with       mentors from industry; and      II.  Demonstrated progress and success of students mentored in six       years:       --   the percentage of women majoring in science has increased            from 12% (45 women) in 1990 to 25% (124) in 1995;       --   one out of every four science majors were women in 1990;            in 1995, four out of every ten (40%) science majors were            women; many have gone on to graduate school;       --   159 science faculty have been involved in effecting this            change;       --   approximately 60% of women entering Dartmouth express an            interest in science vs. 40-45% prior to the project;       --   participation in all programs has jumped from            approximately 100 to approximately 1,000;       --   faculty have mentored over 446 first-year research            interns, 55% of which have declared a science major at            the close of their sophomore year;       --   472 first-year women have been mentored by upper-class            peers in science.",
