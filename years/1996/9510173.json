 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop a set of tools and  techniques for performance analysis and tuning of parallel  programs that bridges this gap between measurement and modeling,  and theory and practice. The approach to performance measurement  and modeling is called \"lost cycles analysis\", and is based on  the observation that the distinction between productive  computation and parallel overhead is useful both for performance  diagnosis and for performance prediction. This approach  decomposes all parallel overhead into mutually-exclusive, yet  comprehensive categories (such as load imbalance and  communication overhead), each of which can be measured and  modeled separately.  These categories express overheads in common  units, called \"lost cycles\", and together represent the portion  of the total execution time not devoted to useful computation.    This research  effort's goal is to build a lost cycles toolkit,  integrating empirical model-building techniques from statistics  with the measurement and modeling techniques of lost cycles  analysis to generate accurate models of application performance.  The toolkit will use a priori knowledge of the sources and  characteristics of overhead in parallel systems to guide and  constrain the modeling process.  It will incorporate techniques  for optimum  experimental design into an experiment generation  tool that will generate a \"script\" of representative program  executions.  During these executions it will use a measurement  tool to record the lost cycles for each overhead category as a  function of the variables of interest (including, but not limited  to, the number of processors and the problem size). It will use  the measurement results obtained from the executions to select  from a database of standard models for overhead categories.  In  addition, it will use a tool for fitting models of overhead  categories to experimental data to establish the constants  associated with a particular hardware and software system. By  automating perfo rmance modeling as much as possible, this effort  intends to make lost cycles analysis practical for everyday use  by parallel programmers.  ***",
