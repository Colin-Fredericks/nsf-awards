 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612244  Happer  The PIs describe an interdisciplinary program to investigate  a revolutionary new technology employing laser-polarized  gases for greatly enhancing the magnetic resonance images  (MRI) of biological cavities such as lungs and sinuses, as  well as nonbiological systems which as voids in ceramics,  etc.  This technique was recently used to obtain the first  MRI images of the gas space of a human lung by a  collaboration between researchers at Princeton and Duke  Universities.  The method uses advances in optical spin  polarization made possible through the understanding of spin  exchange interactions between alkalimetal atoms and noble  gas nuclei developed at Princeton.  To make this a  practical, low cost and widely applied technique for imaging  both biological and non-biological systems, significant  improvements in our understanding of the physics of optical  spin polarization, as well as in the high power laser diodes  necessary to accomplish this task are needed.  In this  project, researchers at Princeton and the University of  Wisconsin will concentrate on the demonstration of very high  power, low cost, long-lifetime Al-free diode laser arrays  with linewidths sufficiently narrow to efficiently polarize  He-3 and Xe-129 for a wide range of MRI applications.  The  laser development includes fabrication of novel MQW  structures with improved carrier confinement, as well as  distributed Bragg reflector and external cavity structures  to achieve narrow linewidths, will build on existing  strengths at both Princeton and UW-Madison in high power  laser diodes.  To improve the MRI technique, the PIs will  explore the possibility of imaging laser polarized gases  dissolved in blood and other liquids.  Methods for  increasing the efficiency of the spinexchange process, and  for accumulating large quantities of spinpolarized gases  will be investigated.  ***",
