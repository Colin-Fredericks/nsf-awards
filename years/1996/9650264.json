 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with several items of equipment required to apply computing to a wide range of classroom settings within the undergraduate geology program. There are two main parts of the project. One utilizes the methods of computer-assisted learning, with particular emphasis on the problem of motivating non-science-majors in large, introductory service courses. This aspect includes computerized lecture presentations that students can later review on-line, along with related materials such as glossaries, study guides, and old exams. Even more important is the interactive component that includes self-grading practice quizzes, computer exercises geared at promoting interpretation of geological observations as opposed to memorization, and class discussions on the Internet. Similar computer-assisted learning methods are also being applied to courses designed for geology majors.   A second major aspect of the project involves providing majors with extensive training in computer applications similar to those they will use as professional geologists. For this accomplishment, a required course, Computer Methods in Geology, has already been instituted to cover computer basics (DOS, Windows, UNIX, e-mail, and the Internet) and several applications programs. Applications include spreadsheets and computer mapping using AutoCAD and several AutoCAD add-in programs.   Most subsequent major courses have extensive lab projects in which these same programs are applied to a variety of geological problems. In addition, students are developing enough general computer expertise that instructors of upper-level major courses are easily able to introduce new, discipline-specific programs, such as for viewing crystal structures or modeling groundwater flow. This work can be disseminated by oral or written presentations of the basic principles of the approach as well as by written lab materials that serve as detailed guidelines for others planning to implement the same methods.",
