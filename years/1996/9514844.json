 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514844  Larson-Prior    The cerebellar cortex is an area of the brain known to  receive  multi-modal sensory information which it uses to organize  appropriate motor  outputs. Incoming sensory information is processed, in part,  by  neurotransmitters whose actions can be modulated by  serotonin.  At this time,  the cellular mechanisms by which the cerebellar cortical  circuit organizes and  integrates incoming sensory data to produce appropriate  motor commands are not  well understood.  In some systems, modulation of  neurotransmission is known to  produce a reorganization of the underlying circuitry which  results in the  generation of different neural responses.  The ability of  serotonin to effect  such changes in the cerebellar cortical circuit will be  examined in these  studies.  It is hypothesized that serotonin provides a  global modulatory signal  that is independent of the type of sensory data being  processed.  Thus, serotonergic input may signal changes in a global  manner that is of  equal relevance to all activated sensory systems.  Under  these circumstances,  cells which project information to the cerebellum utilizing  serotonin as a  transmitter could regulate the level of motor response  evoked by any given  sensory signal dependent upon the state of the organism.  By  providing  information on the manner in which serotonin modulates  cerebellar processing,  these studies will add significant new information  concerning the mechanisms  by which the brain coordinates and controls movement.",
