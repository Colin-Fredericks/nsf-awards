 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527709  Rand   This research will combine the tools of molecular population genetics and experimental field ecology to examine the pattern of natural selection at specific genes in the intertidal acorn barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides).  At the \"Mpi\" and \"Gpi\" genes in the acorn barnacle, two forms of the protein encoded by each gene are found in natural populations.  The two forms of each of these proteins show repeatable differences in their proportions between high- vs. low-tidal heights on sunny exposed rocks.  At shaded sites nearby, there is no clear difference between tidal heights in the proportions of the two types of proteins.  Similar patterns in other  organisms suggest that natural selection for thermal tolerance leads to the differential survival of the two genetic variants in different environments.     Three experiments will be conducted.  1) The investigators will examine the change in frequency of the different proteins and neutral DNA markers in different temporal samples (from larvae in the water column in the spring, through to adult stages in the fall).   2)  A reciprocal transplant experiment will be conducted to manipulate the placement of individuals between high vs. low tidal heights, and sunny vs. shaded sites.  The transplanted individuals will be scored for molecular genetic markers to test whether natural selection is acting on the protein variation.  3) Mpi and Gpi genes from the acorn barnacle will be cloned to determine the DNA sequence variation at these genes.  These experiments will allow identification of the ecological factors leading to the association between genes and environment,  as well as identify the DNA sites at which selection is acting.  No previous studies have explicitly manipulated DNA and protein markers in the intertidal to examine natural selection at specific genes.     This work will provide a synthesis of ecological and genetic analyses that examine adaptation to heterogeneous environments.  Because the relevant selective agent appears t o be thermal stress, this research may help elucidate the effects of climate change on genetic variation.",
