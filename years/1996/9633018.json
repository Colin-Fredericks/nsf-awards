Preparation  and  characterization will be  carried  out  to  produce  samples  with high homogeneity and  single  crystal  samples.  Magnetically oriented samples will be produced  in  high  magnetaic  fields at the National High Magnetic  Field  Laboratory  (NHMFL).   Various  measurements  will  be  made  including   susceptibility,  magnetization,  and  Mossbauer.  Preliminary experiments will be carried out.  %%%  This research planning grant (RPG) will support the planning  of  a systematic experimental investigation of novel layered  magnetic  materials.
