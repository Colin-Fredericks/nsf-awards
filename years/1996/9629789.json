 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629789   White   Social psychological research on persuasive communications   generally shows that message quality determines persuasive   impact when the message recipient is both motivated and able   to process message content.  In the absence of either   motivation or ability, persuasion is often determined by   extra-message factors such as source expertise or source   attractiveness, but not typically by message quality.    Recent research has shown that White college students who   ordinarily would not be motivated to scrutinize a persuasive   message nevertheless engage in deeper processing of message   content if the source is described as a Black or Hispanic   person, or if the message is about members of those ethnic   groups.  These effects suggest that source or target factors   can moderate the likelihood of message elaboration.  It is   hypothesized that the observed increase in scrutiny of such   messages occurs because most people hold ambivalent   attitudes toward members of certain ethnic groups other than   their own.  The proposed research investigateq these   effects, focusing on the underlying cognitive processes that   produce them and on variables that moderate the effect.  A   reaction-time procedure, similar to that used in research on   stereotyping, will be developed to better understand how   people respond to questions about their attitudes and to   measure the amount of time people spend reading specific   parts of a persuasive communication.   %%%   Research in social psychology has shown that characteristics   of the source of a persuasive communication (such as a   person's attractiveness) can influence the persuasive   impact, independently of message quality.  This is most   likely to occur when the recipient of a persuasive   communication is either not able or not motivated to   scrutinize message content.  Recent research has shown that   White college students who ordinarily would not be motivated   to scrutinize a persuasive message nevertheless do engag e in   deeper consideration if the source of the message is   described as Black or Hispanic, or if the message is about   members of those ethnic groups.  It is hypothesized that the   observed increase in students' scrutiny of such messages   occurs because of ambivalent attitudes held toward members   of certain ethnic groups.  The proposed research   investigates these effects, focusing on the underlying   cognitive processes that produce them and on variables that   increase or decrease the effect.  A reaction-time procedure,   similar to that used in research on stereotyping, will be   developed to better understand how people respond to   questions about their attitudes and to measure the amount of   time people spend reading specific parts of a persuasive   communication.  The research has the potential to shed new   light on how different ethnic groups respond to each other,   ultimately contributing to theory and research on intergroup   relations.   ***",
