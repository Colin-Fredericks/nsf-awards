 "awd_abstract_narration": "9613556  Thompson     This proposal seeks to develop fluorescence-based sensors  for chemical analytes of environmental interest, including  mercury, cadmium, nickel cyanide, nitrate, sulfide, and  others.  The sensors incorporate optical fibers  for remote  sensing in process and wastewater monitoring applications.  They can also be designed to be handheld and used in field  work.  In both cases the sensors offer significant  advantages over current technology, which mostly involves  sampling  followed by subsequent analysis in a distant  laboratory.    These sensors are fluorescence-based, and employ a  biomolecule as the transducer element in which the  biomolecule exhibits a change in its fluorescence lifetime  or anisotropy upon recognition of the target chemical.  To  optimize the sensing properties, site-directed mutagenesis  will be used to  develop new variants of the biomolecule.  For the fiber optic sensors, the biomolecules will be  incorporated into existing sensor apparatus for testing.  For the anisotropy-based sensors, the applicants will  construct a new solid state mini-fluorometer. The mini-  fluorometer is intended for field use.  Additional advances  in components may enable it to achieve one hundred-fold  better precision, and thereby improve accuracy and detection  limits.    The significance of the proposed effort is three-fold.  These new sensors are intended to make monitoring of process  water recycling, wastewater outflows, and ground water  simpler, safer, more precise, less costly, and more  automated.  Improved sensors may not only make processes  more efficient and fail-safe, but, in the case of nitrates,  they may reduce the cost to the farmer and reduce pollution  by preventing over-fertilizing.  These new sensors also may  be precise enough to provide results comparable with current  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard methods.",
