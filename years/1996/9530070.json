The inter-institutional and   multi-national character of this proposed training center will benefit from   the ongoing participation of scientists from institutions throughout the   world.  This Phase I proposal will focus on the necessary activities to   design the \"Training and Education Center in Radar Science and   Technologies\" which will be the objective of a Phase II proposal.  The   design activities will encompass 2 meetings to determine the center's   characteristics and its educational program, the level and number of   students, and the types of degrees or certificates to be conferred.  In   addition, there will be discussion regarding professors and the needs of   other Latin American countries in the formation of their research teams   (current or planned).  Radars are very powerful tools for remote sensing of the atmosphere.  Radar   techniques may be essential for many of the observations required in the   study of the following Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research   (IAI) research themes:  High Latitude Processes; El Ni=F1o-Southern   Oscillation and Interannual Climate Variability, and Ocean-Land Atmospheric   Interaction in the Intertropical Americas.  Specifically, radar techniques   can assist in observations which address the ozone problem, ocean surface   currents, sea state, iceberg drifts at high lati tudes, the  effects of the   El Ni=F1o-Southern Oscillation phenomenon, and other air-sea interactions.   This workshop will prepare a Phase II proposal to establish a center for   training and education in radar remote sensing science and technology so   that scientists in the region can better use radar observations.  The   training will be at the post-graduate level and will involve professors and   students in research projects in the above mentioned topics.  %%%  This proposal will allow the planning of an Inter-American training center   for radar remote sensing in Peru, using the world-class research   infrastructure that already exists at Piura and Jicamarca.  The   inter-institutional and multi-national character of this proposed training   center will benefit from the ongoing participation of scientists from   institutions throughout the world.  This Phase I proposal will focus on the   necessary activities to design the \"Training and Education Center in Radar   Science and Technologies\" which will be the objective of a Phase II   proposal.  The design activities will encompass 2 meetings to determine the   center's characteristics and its educational program, the level and number   of students, and the types of degrees or certificates to be conferred.  In   addition, there will be discussion regarding professors and the needs of   other Latin American countries in the formation of their research teams   (current or planned).  This proposal for the planning of a center for training and education in   radar remote sensing science and technology addresses the Inter-American   Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) cross-cutting theme of training   and education.  In addition, this proposed center will provide training in   radar techniques which may be essential for may of the observations   required in the study of the following IAI priority research themes:  High   Latitude Processes; El Ni=F1o-Southern Oscillation and Interannual Climate   Variability, and Ocean-Land Atmospheric I nteraction in the Intertropical   Americas.  The Jicamarca Radar Observatory, the Peruvian   Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere radar in Antarctica, and the Piura   Wind-Profiler Radar (all incorporated in this proposed training center)   will be available for scientists from the Americas to use.  A fundamental   aim of the project is to use this center to transfer world-class radar   techniques to other research groups in order to increase the potential of   radars to achieve the goals of the IAI.  The following countries are participating in the organization of this   proposal:  Peru and the United States.  These countries are Member States   of the IAI, a U.S. initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global   change issues among the scientific institutions of the Americas.  The U.S.   National Science Foundation is the U.S. Government agency designated to   carry out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.  ***          --========================_13392216==_--",
