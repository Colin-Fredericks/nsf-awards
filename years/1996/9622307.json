An example of such  a system is a magnetic material which undergoes a phase transition from  ferromagnetic to helicoidal as a physically important parameter (e.g.  pressure, or the composition of metal alloys) passes through a critical  value.  Such phase transitions also occur in liquid crystals, and in  concentrated soap solutions.  A prototype model for these systems consists  of a fourth order partial differential equation derived as a generalization  of the classical, second order Fisher-Kolmogorov equation.  A parameter gamma  multiplies the fourth order spatial derivative, and for gamma equal to zero  the equation reduces to the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation.  Thus, the model  has been named the Extended Fisher Kolmogorov (EFK) equation in the physics  literature.  Depending on the choice of gamma, numerical studies indicate  that the set of solutions can become extremely complicated.  Such solutions  include monotone transition layers known as ``kinks'', homoclinic orbits,  periodic and aperiodic solutions, chaos, and travelling waves.  To prove the  existence of these kinds of solutions, the proposer and L.A. Peletier of the  University of Leiden, Holland, are using a new analytical method which they  have recently developed.  The method has proved successful for proving the  existence of kinks, periodic solutions and chaos.  The proposer is now apply-  ing this new method to study the formation of wave fronts.  In addition to the  EFK equation, the proposer is also studying a wider class of equations.  Of particular interest is a model of suspension bridges such as the Golden  Gate bridge.  The model is also fourth order, but the nonlinear terms cause  the analysis of the equation to be fundamentally different from that of the  EFK model.  As with the EFK equation, the proposer is  studying the suspension  bridge model in order to understand the mechanisms responsible for complicated  pattern formation.  %%%  The primary goal of this research is to obtain an understanding of  the mechanisms responsible for pattern formation in bistable systems  which are near a second order phase transition point.
