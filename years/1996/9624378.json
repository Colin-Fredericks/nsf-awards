 "awd_abstract_narration": "Program behavior studies reveal that most current high  performance processors spend more time computing addresses  and accessing data than performing the functional operations  required by application programs. This research consists of  investigating issues in the design of a balanced multiple  issues architecture that improves the access-execute  balance, maximized the decoupling between the various  functional units, exploits higher concurrency and achieves  higher performance.  The techniques used to alleviate access-  execute imbalance include (I) executing multiple access  tasks in parallel, (ii) providing architectural support for  complex access primitives, and (iii) providing application-  specific access primitives.  Also performed will be  investigations on improving concurrency between access and  execute processes.  Concurrency between access and execution  has been exploited by queues in many decoupled access-  execute architectures, but data dependent control  dependencies  often prohibit prefetching of data to queues.  This research will investigate techniques to facilitate  anticipatory loading to queues even in presence of data  dependent control dependencies. The research will build on  the PI's previous studies on accessexecute decoupling and  other schemes to improve the performance of memory  accessing.    The PI is incorporating innovative techniques such as active  learning, and cooperative learning into the classroom.  She  wants to emphasize design, design automation, and  experimental aspects in her courses.  As part of curriculum  improvement, a new graduate course on Advanced Computer  architecture and an undergraduate course and laboratory on  Digital Design using FPGAs are being developed.  The PI also  plans to participate in outreach activities for high-school  students and special programs for women and minorities.  The  overall objective is to stimulate efficient learning at  graduate, undergraduate and pre-college levels of education.  ***",
