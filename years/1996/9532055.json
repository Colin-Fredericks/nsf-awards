 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sachs  9532055       The investigator models chromosome aberrations in live  mammalian cells, emphasizing implications for large-scale  chromosome geometry and for the biology of ionizing radiation  damage.  He analyzes formation of chromosome aberrations after  induction of DNA double strand breaks by radiation during the  interphase part of the cell cycle, using probabilistic models for  DNA geometry, motion, and reactions at the macromolecular level.  For example, one area concerns the combinatorics and kinetics of  illegitimate recombinations, involving the exchange of fragments  between several different chromosomes.  Polymer models are used  for large-scale chromosome structure and motion.  Statistical  questions arise when very detailed experimental information about  specific individual chromosomes is made available by modern  fluorescent in situ hybridization techniques; these he addresses  by extending already developed Monte-Carlo simulations.  The  study involves developing computer algorithms, explicitly solving  stochastic process models, and collaborating with experimental  groups.       Ionizing radiation damage to chromosomes is being studied  mathematically.  When ionizing radiation hits cells, as occurs for  example in tumor radiotherapy or radiation accidents, one gets  breakage and large-scale reshuffling of DNA molecules.  The  resulting chromosome aberrations have been implicated as symptoms  or causes of most major radiobiological effects.  They are  especially important in biodosimetry, the estimation of past  exposure to radiation dose by looking at residual cellular  damage.  They are also a window on fundamental biology because  they are influenced by, and symptomatic of, chromosome geometry  and motion.  Recent developments, whereby specific human  chromosomes can be \"painted\" different colors, have dramatically  increased the amount of information obtained from aberration  studies.  A very rich and colorful variety of aberrations can now  be observed.  Trying to und erstand the number and kind of  reshufflings one sees leads to mathematically nontrivial  problems, amenable to computer simulations or \"pen and paper\"  calculations.  The simulations and calculations are being carried  out under the grant.  The results allow systematic comparisons of  cellular radiation damage effects observed by different  laboratories using different chromosome painting schemes.  In  addition, mechanistic modeling of how chromosome aberrations  evolve in time is helping to attack the main mystery of  radiobiology: how to extrapolate from the larger doses needed for  statistically significant experimental results to the much  smaller doses relevant to risk estimates for large human  populations subjected to radiation from environmental or man-made  sources.",
