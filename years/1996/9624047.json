A  systematic  study is planned of the evolution of the first  order  melting  transition  in  very clean YBCO  single  crystals  as  a  function   of  controlled  point  disorder  created   by   proton  irradiation.  The dependence on the critical point, the  critical  regime, and the scaling exponents on the introduced disorder will  be  determined.   Insight  will be gained  into  the  fundamental  nature  of  the  vortex-defect  interactions,  a  parameter  also  important  for  technological  applications.  The  project  is  a  collaboration  between  Western Michigan University  and  Argonne  National Laboratory.  %%%  This  Research  Planning  Grant will support  the  study  of  the  magnetic flux lines in high temperature superconductors (HTS).  A  systematic  study is planned of the evolution of  the  flux  line  motion in very clean single crystals of the yttrium-barium-copper-  oxygen HTS as a function of controlled disorder created by proton  irradiation.   Increased  current flow  in  HTS  materials  in  a  magnetic  field  is  important for technological  application  of  these materials. The research will examine how the magnetic field  flux lines can be controlled in the HTS to reduce dissipation and  thus  increase  current  flow. The  project  is  a  collaboration  between   Western   Michigan  University  and  Argonne   National  Laboratory.  ***",
