 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to significantly enhance student performance in Structure and Function laboratory. The major objectives are to introduce the nonmajor students to the relevance of modern research techniques to the society at large and to transform the static observation-based laboratories into dynamic participation-oriented sessions. It is critical that students understand the principles of cell function before they can learn about the general physiology and pathophysiology of the human body. Therefore, it is essential that students understand the nature of DNA and proteins. To gain this understanding, students are being introduced to SDS-PAGE, zymography, and agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA. Through these hands-on techniques, students can understand the nature of proteins and develop an insight into and appreciation for recombinant DNA technology. A laboratory on morphogenesis is included and forces the students to synthesize physiological concepts from isolated facts.   To enhance student appreciation of form and function, the project is replacing/supplementing memorization-based models with actively learning models such as Maniken and functioning eye and ear models. These models promote cooperative learning and stimulate critical thinking through active experimentation. For efficient use of the limited laboratory time, instructions and demonstrations are given to the entire class with the aid of a visual presenter. For example, the visual presenter enables the instructor to demonstrate the methods of dissection, details of a skull structure, radiographs, angiograms, etc., to every single student in the class at a given time. Of equal importance, the visual presenter enables the students to demonstrate to the entire class what they have learned in a given laboratory. The project enhances student creativity and promotes active student participation. Above all, the students can understand human anatomy and physiology through the eyes of modern science.",
