These  polymers  exhibit  an  enormous  diversity   of  interesting  and technologically important physical behavior.  X-  ray  and  neutron scattering techniques will be used to determine  the  local atomic structural characteristics which influence  the  structure/property  relationships  in  these   materials.   These  experimental  methods will be complemented  by  modeling  methods  which generate physically accurate molecular structures. Finally,  methods will also be developed for studying the evolution in situ  so  that  subtle  and  transient effects  can  be  discerned  and  analyzed.  The  knowledge and techniques  developed  through  the  course  of this research will provide basic and accurate  answers  to  many  fundamental questions that currently  exist  concerning  structure  and  its  evolution in conducting polymer  hosts.
