 "awd_abstract_narration": "While the Fourier transform is an indispensable tool in signal  processing and linear time-invariant (LTI) systems analysis, as  well as a staple of the electrical engineering education, many  natural and man-made processes are not time-invariant but rather  exhibit frequencies that change over time (e.g., FM communication  systems, the Doppler effect, speech and other biomedical signals).   The conventional short-time, or \"quasi-stationary,\" extensions of  LTI concepts for studying such processes is often inadequate; for  example, depending upon the short-time analysis interval length  selected, dramatically different results can be obtained for the  same process, particularly when the signal contains both transients  and harmonics.  Accordingly, there is a need, both in engineering  practice and pedagogy, for the development of new methods for time-  varying (or nonstationary) signal processing.    This research involves the development and application of a general  method of nonstationary signal processing that surmounts the  limitations of methods based on the extension of LTI concepts to  time-varying situations.  The principle objectives of this research  are to: (1) develop new joint density-based methods for  nonstationary signal processing (e.g., scale); (2) apply these new  methods to challenging, practical problems in biomedical signal  analysis and machine health monitoring (which fall under the  biotechnology and manufacturing Federal Strategic Areas); and, (3)  develop a general educational framework for nonstationary signal  processing based on the new methods, via new instructional  laboratory courses and research opportunities for college  undergraduate and graduate students.",
