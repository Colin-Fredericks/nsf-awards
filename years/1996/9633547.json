 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633547 Nemanich  This research project aims for significant advancement in fundamental understanding of metal-semiconductor interfaces, particularly with respect to formation of Schottky barriers on GeSi surfaces, but also with respect to broader issues such as the effect of strain on barrier height.  Specific goals include investigation of the effect of strain on barrier height, combined experimental/theoretical investigations of Metal-Silicon-Germanium phase formation, and the effect of surface roughening on contact resistance.  The general approach is to combine advanced MBE and CVD growth methods and in-situ surface characterization techniques with high resolution TEM and other ex-situ film characterization techniques to explore the chemical stability of model ternary interfaces, examine the Schottky barrier at the interface of strained and relaxed SiGe alloys, to explore materials and electrical properties of morphologically rough epitaxial interfaces, and to initiate new studies of epitaxial silicide/silicon nano-structures. %%% The project is multidisciplinary combining fundamental materials physics and materials science synthesis and processing studies with advanced characterization tools and analysis methods to address forefront issues in a topical area of strong technological relevance and high potential payoff.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to several aspects of advanced electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
