 "awd_abstract_narration": "Indiana U.  Very few studies have examined the linkages between migration and life cycle events on a longitudinal basis.  This award will allow the development of analyses which connect migration to critical events as a working career unfolds.  The analysis will rely upon information regarding the timing of migration and work history events through data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation of the U.S. Census.  Hypotheses will be tested from human capital models and the framework of life course analysis using statistical models that have already been developed for the analysis of longitudinal data.  The research promises new theoretical insights into the linked nature of events in the life course and thus contributes both to this body of literature as well as the migration literature.  In an empirical manner the research will allow the evaluation of how closely migration is associated with labor force activity and to show the importance of specific events.",
