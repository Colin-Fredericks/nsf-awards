 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634545  Teich    In 1993, the American Association for the Advancement of Science  (AAAS) initiated an effort to assist NSF and the state EPSCoR  programs in developing a clearer understanding of the concept of a  state's competitiveness in research, developing criteria for  assessing competitiveness and its progress over time, and  identifying strategies to enhance competitiveness.  This effort has  yielded important results which have improved the understanding of  what makes states, institutions, and individuals competitive in  research.  The results are in a book published by AAAS early in  1996 entitled, Competitiveness in Academic Research (Albert H.  Teich, editor).  The present proposal seeks support to build on  this intellectual base and use AAAS's resources to build closer  ties between the EPSCoR program participants and the broader  science and technology community.    The proposed project will have three elements: (1) A leadership  development program to assist EPSCoR states in developing and  nurturing ties to the broader scientific community.  This element  will include a series of regional meetings for EPSCoR personnel  aimed at giving them the opportunity to think systematically about  the conceptual and practical issues surrounding their programs; (2)  A technical assistance extension service to work with EPSCoR states  in shaping their science and technology development plans and  integrating those plans into broader economic and social  development strategies.  Under this project element, a team of  world-class experts will be developed and made available to state  EPSCoR programs to assist them in their planning and proposal  development efforts; (3) An effort to enrich the intellectual  framework of the EPSCoR program through an examination of the  nature of competitiveness in research and the relative efficacy of  various strategies aimed at achieving it, extending and exploiting  the work begun under the initial AAAS EPSCoR project and gaining  additional value from i t.       A distinguished advisory committee constituted by the AAAS  Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPP) and  including members of COSEPP, state EPSCOR project directors, and  others with relevant perspectives and expertise, will oversee all  aspects of the project.  The project is planned to run for three  years.",
