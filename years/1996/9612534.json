 "awd_abstract_narration": "Romero  9612534      One of the defining features of life is the interaction of an  organism with its environment.  Unfortunately, not all such  interactions are benign and the effects of noxious or stressful  stimuli must somehow be ameliorated in order for an organism to  survive.  Vertebrates react to noxious stimuli with a suite of  behavioral and hormonal responses, collectively called the stress  response.  The stress response is crucial for survival since even  mildly noxious stimuli can cause death in animals unable to  respond.  Unfortunately, long-term exposure to stress can lead to  a multitude of deleterious effects, including brain cell death.   Presumably, a balance must be struck between needing a stress  response to survive a noxious stimuli and controlling that stress  response to prevent deleterious effects.  Recent studies by Dr.  Romero have suggested that some species seasonally control stress  responses.  The present studies are investigating the novel  mechanisms by which this unique seasonal regulation of the  behavioral and hormonal components of the stress response occurs.   These studies are making important new contributions to our  understanding of the basic neuroendocrine regulation of the stress  response.  In addition, the studies will provide significant new  insights into the physiological strategies employed by species in  the wild to grow, prosper and reproduce.",
