 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623394  Nochetto    Problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) which   exhibit sharp or diffuse, but rapid, transitions are of primary importance in   science and engineering. Liquid-solid phase transitions, multicomponent   alloys, anisotropy and junctions, epitaxial growth, multiphase   incompressible fluids, and advection dominated flows are relevant   multiscale examples considered in this project. The design, analysis and   implementation of innovative finite element methods which handle the   presence of free boundaries, thin layers and constraints, and the same time   cope with possible numerical pollution effects via adaptively refined   meshes is central to this project. A priori stability and error analyses,   together with a posteriori error control are quite delicate aspects of the   proposed research that reveal the limited value of linear theory in the   context of strongly nonlinear PDEs. A posteriori error estimates for   degenerate parabolic PDEs must reflect the  distinctive presence of free   boundaries and thin transition layers. Related PDE and computational issues   (implementation, recursive refinement/coarsening algorithms, multilevel   solvers) will also be investigated.    This project is expected to shed light on the efficient and reliable adaptive   finite element computation of phase transitions in materials science, and   thus have impact on high performance computing of phase transitions with   surface tension effects. Understanding and computing nonlinear evolutions   of corrugations observed in epitaxial growth is of fundamental importance   in electronics and materials science. Novel finite element methods will be   designed and used to explore a simple model for stress driven instabilities in   solids. Validation of a taxis model describing coexistence and interaction of   several marine species in response to foraging, predators and environmental   conditions is crucial in ecology and environmental sciences. Mixed finite   element me thods will be used in conjunction with exponential fitting to   better exploit the structure of taxis in the underlying system of nonlinear   PDEs in both extremes of advection and diffusion dominated flows.",
