 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors Gary Hachtel and Fabio Somenzi, and  a graduate student, all from the University of Colorado, to  collaborate in computer science research with Professor Christoph  Meinel and others of the Department of Computer Science and  Complexity Theory and VLSI-Design of the University of Trier,  Germany.  They are working in the area of computer-aided circuit  design, focusing on the synthesis and verification of digital  systems using `binary decision diagram` data structures.  Together  they will explore new classes of these efficient data structures  and their behaviors in specific applications.  Previous work by the  group at Trier on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) has  focused primarily on the theoretical foundations and the connection  with complexity theory.  The US group has been motivated by real  problems of electrical engineering such as sequential circuit  verification, optimization and testing.  The plan for collaboration  will transfer and combine the complementary knowledge and  experience of the two groups.  The resulting synergism should  result in contributions to both theoretical and practical aspects  of circuit design.",
