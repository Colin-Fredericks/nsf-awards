 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates ethical and conceptual issues raised by racial and ethnic classifications in demography, particularly in the context of the 2000 census.  Currently, the Office of Management and Budget's Directive 15 governs the collection not only of census data but of all federal data concerning race and ethnicity.  Over the last several years that directive has come under increasing scrutiny.  Some argue that new categories, such as a `multiracial` category, ought to be added; others propose changing the names of certain categories; and some suggest scrapping the entire racial/ethnic classification scheme.  The considerable research under way focuses on empirical questions, such as how various groups understand and use the descriptors.  However, the relevance of this research for proposed revisions requires an understanding also of the ethical, conceptual, and methodological issues underlying racial and ethnic classification.  This project will analyze these issues and consider their significance for competing schemes.  One set of issues concerns ethical and policy choices, such as whether the harms of past classification schemes are best redressed by preserving, refining, or eliminating them.  Answering this question requires an examination of the significance of racial and ethnic identity and of the legitimacy of the purposes served by racial classification.  Demographic research needs raise another set of problems, including the requirement of comparability between past classification schemes and future ones, the issue of measurement effects -- how and to what extent different classification schemes may affect what is measured, and the role and significance of self reports in data collection.  The research is a collaboration between philosophers, a lawyer-social psychologist, and a demographer.  Each will lead a different aspect of the research, which will employ the methods of moral philosophy, philosophy of science, legal analysis and demography.  Among the products of the research will be a memorandum submitted to OMB, a series of papers to be published in appropriate journals including public policy journals, and an anthology.",
