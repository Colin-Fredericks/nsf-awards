 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623197  LI, W-S      The purpose of this project is to obtain    a better understanding of the structure of bounded linear  operators acting on a complex, separable, infinite dimensional  Hilbert space. During the past sixteen years, the theory of dual algebras   has provided us considerable knowledge for the dilation theory   of contraction operators, the invariant subspace problem, and the   reflexivity problem. The principal investigator plans to continue this  program, focusing now on more general classes of operators and dual   algebras generated by more than one operator.  At the same time,  the principal investigator will also continue   her research on control theory via the commutant   lifting theorem. In addition, she will also continue her study of   the class of C-0 operators.        My current work is in operator theory, in particular studying the   structure of linear operators on Hilbert spaces. These operators   appear in many mathematical models, which are used in physics, economy,   engineering, etc.. Therefore, a better understanding of these   operators is of fundamental importance since it should lead in   improving these models as well as the qualities of the simulations and forecasts made out them.",
