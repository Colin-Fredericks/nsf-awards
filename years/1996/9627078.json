 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project describes contemporary Yup'ik conceptions of wellness,  i.e., beliefs and practices associated with health promotion and  illness prevention.  Research is being conducted over a twelve  month period in Bethel, Alaska which is the hub of the Yukon-  Kuskokwim Delta, the most populous region of Yup'ik speakers in the  state.  The hospital there serves as the medical center for 56  villages.  The project entails collaboration with the Alaska Native  regional health entity operating the hospital to prioritize  specific issues of concern within the topic of Yup'ik conceptions  of wellness.  The specific issues identified are the focus of  ethnographic research at the hospital.    By most epidemiologic, economic, demographic, and social health  measures, this region is the most disadvantaged in the state.   Acute infectious disease contributes substantial morbidity.   Additionally, many health problems are due to chronic disease,  injury, and other health problems that have a behavioral factor as  a contributing cause, the prevention which entails a behavior  change component.  The illness profile describing the disease and  psychosocial dysfunction of the people of the region is well  defined.  A wellness profile will be developed through compilation  of quantitative data on diachronic indices of risk factors and  health behavior change, and qualitative, ethnograpic data  describing cognitive categories related to preventive health  domains, explanatory models of illness episodes and their  relationship to wellness, and health behavior \"success stories\".    By focusing on contemporary beliefs, the research will advance the  knowledge of:  Yup'ik conceptual categories of etiology and  prevention; beliefs of a much wider age group than has previously  been described; and beliefs related to health issues previously  unexamined.  Paradoxically, this work that focuses on the  contemporary and on fostering behavior change, could advance the  Yup'ik cultural revitalization agenda by reinforcing  the  traditional Yup'ik value of illness prevention and belief in the  role of human agency in the health of the individual and the  community.    Interactive activities include teaching an undergraduate course,  instruction and supervision of students as research assistants,  teaching a graduate course for health care providers, giving guest  lectures including instruction for Community Health Aides at the  Alaska Statewide Community Health Aide Conference in Anchorage in  April 1997.",
