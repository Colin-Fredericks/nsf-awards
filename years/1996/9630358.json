 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630358  Dooner  The meiotic recombination process in maize will be further investigated with the use of the large collection of mutants which have a defect in the bronze (bz) gene. That gene affects seed pigmentation and is at least 100 times more recombinogenic than the average DNA segment in maize, so that many intragenic recombinants can be generated for analysis. The meiotic recombination process in maize will be investigated by 1) determining the continuity and average length of conversion tracts for the bz region in a constant genetic background, 2) determining the relationship between genetic and physical distance outside of the bz gene, correlating it with the repetitive vs. the unique nature of the flanking DNA and comparing it with the relationship already determined inside of the bz locus, 3) refining the relationship between genetic and physical distance within bz, 4) further analyzing the suppressing effect of insertions on intragenic as well as intergenic, recombination and determine the extant to which single base pair heterologies affect recombination and 5) examining the fidelity of the recombination process in maize.  %%%  Meiotic recombination is a fundamental genetic process and can serve to create novel genotypes in sexually reproducing organisms. Yet, in spite of its importance, little work has been done to elucidate the process of meiotic recombination in plants. This work will make important contributions to that small storehouse of knowledge in this area.  ***",
