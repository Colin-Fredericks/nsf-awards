This included  efforts  in  two  main  areas: (a) The propagation of light through  foams  by  multiple-scattering and the use of this generic phenomenon  as  a  structural  probe,  and  (b)  The  influence  of  evolution   and  shear-induced structural rearrangements on linear shear  rheology  and  time  evolution.  Special interest is in  determining  if  a  linear  regime exists, if structural rearrangements  can  play  a  role  equivalent to thermal fluctuations and hence be assigned  a  \"temperature\",  and  if flow can affect time evolution.  Rheology  measurements  will be accomplished with a commercial  device  and  also  with a custom Couette-cell which allows simultaneous access  for  measurement of the bubble-packing structure and dynamics  by  multiple    light   scattering   techniques.   The    fundamental  understanding  thus  achieved may provide a  framework  for  more  complex  systems  where  dense random  packing  and  irreversible  structural rearrangements dictate macroscopic behavior,  such  as  dense emulsions, colloidal suspensions, and granular media.  %%%  Liquid-based foams consist of a large number of gas bubbles  very  closely  packed together in a small amount of liquid, as familiar  from everyday life. The proposed experiments are designed to help  achieve  a  fundamental understanding of the important properties  of  these materials, namely their stability and flow behavior, in  terms  of their microscopic structure and composition. Little  is  yet known due to the fact that light is strongly scattered by the  bubble  interfaces,  thus restricting visual observation  of  the  bubble-packing structure to the surface bubbles. However, we have  re cently   developed  new  experimental  techniques  which   take  advantage of multiple light scattering and which reveal  for  the  first time details of the packing structure and its behavior. The  fundamental   understanding  achieved  through   use   of   these  techniques   may   enable  rational  design   of   foaming-liquid  formulations, foaming techniques, and anti-foaming  agents.  This  could  benefit diverse industries where foams are currently dealt  with  by  trial-and-error:  food,  cosmetic,  detergent,  mining,  petroleum,  pulp  &  paper,  paint & coating,  textile,  leather,  polymer, and waste and water remediation.  ***",
