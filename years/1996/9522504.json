Most  piezoelectric  leadzirconium  titanates  (PZTs)  are  used  under  AC  fields,  where  the  combined   mechanical  and  electrical  loading  can   cause  component failure.  Finite element models developed  in  the  current   project   will  be  extended   to   describe   the  electromechanical  response  of  PZT  under  a  variety   of  boundary  conditions.   In addition, a  novel  technique  of  laser  Raman spectroscopy (LRS) will be applied to  directly  measure  the distribution of crack tip stresses produced  by  applied electric fields.  The results will be compared  with  stresses calculated using FEA models.  The proposed research  objectives will be accomplished by performing in situ  crack  propagation studies in PZT ceramics under static (DC) and  cyclic    (AC)    electric   fields,   directly    measuring  electricallygenerated crack tip stresses in situ using  LRS,  developing a finite element model to describe the effect  of  applied  electric field on crack propagation,  and  studying  the  influence  of  microstructure and  composition  on  the  induced phase transformations in PZT ceramics.  %%%  These   studies   will  lead  to  a  new   and   fundamental  understanding   of   the   electromechanical   response   of  piezoelectric   materials  under   combined   electric   and  mechanical  loads.  A new techniques using LRS for  directly  measuring crack tip stresses will be demonstrated along with  the  possibilities  of induced phase transformation  in  the  strontium-doped  PZT system.  ***",
