 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two major challenges facing the U.S. construction industry today are (1) the lack of women  educators and practitioners in the field of construction engineering and management and (2) the  decline of productivity in the construction industry.    The proposed research program will address the first concern by (1) proactive recruitment of  women engineering students (at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels) to pursue  education, research, and careers in construction; (2) mentoring of Graduate Research Trainees  by faculty members, industry professionals, and advanced graduate students; and (3) providing  training to Graduate Research Trainees on research, teaching, technical writing and presentation  skills.    The second concern will be addressed by guiding the Graduate Research Trainees to expand  upon the ongoing research in construction automation and robotics at the University.  This  research will result in the development of a Computer-Aided Design/Construction (CAD/CAC)  System capable of:  (1) evaluating CAD models from the perspective of constructability; (2)  selecting suitable automated construction equipment for a project; (3) generating efficient process  plans for operation of the automated equipment; and (4) generating equipment-level control  instructions.    This interdisciplinary research will facilitate the implementation of flexible automation  technologies in the U.S. construction industry and will thereby improve its competitiveness in  the global marketplace.",
