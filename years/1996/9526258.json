 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526258  Klemperer      The coastal region of northern California from latitude 39oN to42oN  represents a region in which the active tectonic regime changes  abruptly from subduction to transform motion at the Mendocino  Triple Junction (MTJ).  Knowledge of the crustal and upper-mantle  structure in this region, when combined with information on the  plate-tectonic history, geologic structure, seismic activity, and  timing and extent of heat influx and consequent surface volcanism,  places constraints on the processes that control continental growth  and evolution.  Because the triple junction has been migrating  north along the coast of North America, an understanding of crustal  structure and evolution in this region will provide insights into  the geologic history of the entire U.S. west coast continental  margin and will contribute to better assessments of the seismic  hazards represented by the Cascadia subduction zone and northern  San Andreas Fault system.    In 1993 and 1994 the principal investigators collected a network of  large-aperture seismic profiles to image the crustal and upper-  mantle structure beneath northern California and the adjacent  continental margin.  The data include approximately 650 km of  onshore seismic refraction/reflection data, 2000 km of offshore  multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection data, and simultaneous  onshore and offshore recording of the MCS airgun source to yield  large-aperture data.  Scientists from more than 12 institutions  were involved in data acquisition, which was led by a team of  principal investigators from Oregon State, Lehigh, Rice, and  Stanford Universities and from the U.S. Geological Survey.    This award provides a fourth year of support from the Continental  Dynamics program to permit the principal investigators to complete  data analysis and presentation.  Support for a workshop is also  provided during which they will discuss their seismological results  with the broader community of earth scientists interested in   geological,  geodynamic, and natural hazard issues associated with  plate interactions in along the western margin of North America.  ***",
