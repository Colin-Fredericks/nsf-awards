Currently there are 18 companies involved in the Center.      This Center has been in existence for six years.  Continued operational support for the next four years will enable the Center to continue the high level of graduate student involvement in its research program (112 have been involved to date).  The Center's research is aimed at providing the technology base for a new generation of energy-efficient, quiet and reliable equipment that can use ozone-safe refrigerants.  The phaseout of environmentally-damaging refrigerants rendered nearly useless he industry's massive empirical data base which served as the foundation for design.  The Center's ongoing and proposed research provides a fundamental understanding of factors affecting: thermodynamic and transport properties of lubricants in pure and zeotropic mixtures of hydroflurocarbon refrigerants: heat transfer, pressure drop; frost formation and growth; friction and wear; and system performance, controls and diagnostics.    Additional funding is provided in this award to support two undergraduate students to work on two Center projects: \"An integrated approach to experimental studies of air-side heat transfer enhancements\" and \"Modeling, diagnostics and controls for mobile air conditioning systems\".",
