 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research includes a quantitative X-ray resonant magnetic  scattering study of the magnetic phase behavior of the HoPr site-  random thin film alloy as function of concentration.  The study  entails:          o    chemical and magnetic structural characterization of HoPr            samples ranging in concentration of 20%Pr/80%Ho to            80%Pr/20%Ho to elucidate the RKKY indirect magnetic            exchange interaction in the rare earth elements.         o    Studies of magnetic wavevector and the magnetic order            parameter of Ho and Pr atoms separately, by tuning the            incident energy at the Ho LIIIedge and Pr LIIedge.         o    Measurement of the induced moments on the Pr atoms.    The research also includes characterization of the interfaces in  the semiconductor system InAs/GaSb, by X-ray reflectivity and  anomalous scattering.  This artificially grown quantum  heterojunction, has received considerable research attention, due  to the potential application for optical and electronic       devices.    The interactive activities include: teaching two courses in project  WISE; collaborating with Prof. Emilio Mendez on semiconductor  research, and interacting with Prof. Richard Gambino on new  magnetic materials and Prof. Peter Stephens on synchrotron related  projects; acting as advisor and mentor to the female students in  physics; and presenting a formal graduate seminar in X-ray magnetic  scattering.",
