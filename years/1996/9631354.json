 "awd_abstract_narration": "Impingement of fish into hydroelectric dams and water intakes to  power plants is a significant problem in many parts of the United  States. The problems are two-fold. First, many fish are killed when  they encounter the dams or intakes and cannot escape the rapidly  flowing water. Second, there is potential damage to the power  generating equipment due to the large number of impinged fish. Thus,  it is of considerable economic importance to find ways to prevent the  interactions between fish and the dams or power plant intakes.           One of the most successful methods developed to date is the use of  high frequency sound to repel clupeid fishes (herrings and relatives)  from these obstacles. For reasons that are yet unknown, these  commercially important species swim away from these sounds. At the  same time, we know very little about how clupeids detect the  ultrasonic sounds, or the kinds of sounds that can be most  successfully used to repel the fish. The purpose of this study is to  examine the hearing ability of clupeids in order to better understand  how they detect sounds, and which sounds they detect, with the  ultimate goal being to develop methods to more effectively prevent  the impingement of clupeids at dams and power plant intakes.",
