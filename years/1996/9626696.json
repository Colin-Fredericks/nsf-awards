 "awd_abstract_narration": "Borgers  9626696       The investigator studies grid-based computational methods  for the simulation of steady particle beams penetrating passively  scattering backgrounds.  Such beams are of interest in several  fields; the application motivating the parameter choices in this  project is radiation therapy using electron beams.  Mathematically, the problem is modeled by a linear Boltzmann  equation with inflow boundary conditions.  The linear Boltzmann  equation resembles a convection-diffusion equation in  six-dimensional position/velocity space.  Particles are convected,  while their direction vector undergoes a process resembling  diffusion on the unit sphere, and their energy undergoes a  process resembling convection-diffusion.  The boundary data in a  beam problem have singularities corresponding to sharp beam edges  and monodirectionality of incident beams.  The first half of the  project concerns accurate ways of dealing with these  singularities.  Difference schemes designed for convection  problems with discontinuous solutions are used to resolve beam  edges.  Explicit-implicit schemes with implicit treatment of the  directional diffusion are used to deal with the  monodirectionality of incident beams.  The second half of the  project concerns the treatment plan optimization problem in  radiation therapy.  Specifically, the investigator studies the  application of methods using second derivatives and of multilevel  methods.  At its present stage, the project focuses on model  problems in two space dimensions with one additional independent  variable denoting particle direction.       Computational techniques are extensively used for radiation  therapy treatment planning in current clinical practice.  The  numerical methods underlying current treatment planning systems  have been developed by the medical physics community; the  radiotherapy planning problem has received little attention from  mathematicians and numerical analysts.  However, numerical  techniques developed for particle b eam problems by the nuclear  engineering community, and techniques developed in different  contexts by numerical analysts, have a strong potential of being  helpful in the development of more accurate treatment planning  algorithms.  In the judgement of medical physicists, advances in  the accuracy of treatment planning algorithms may translate into  greater success in the radiation treatment of cancer.  The  investigator, whose background is in numerical analysis, studies  the application of approaches developed by numerical analysts to  the radiotherapy planning problem.",
