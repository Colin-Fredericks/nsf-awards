 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514846  Lin    International corporation is proposed on a research project  aimed at developing a novel ceramic membrane reactor for  efficient conversion of methane to ethylene.  The membrane  reactor uses a proton-conducting ceramic membrane with a  surface which is catalytically active for methane coupling.  The research project consists of membrane synthesis by  various methods, membrane characterization, and hydrogen  permeation/methane conversion reaction on the membrane  reactor.  The project is of multi-disciplinary nature,  involving solid state ionics, chemical vapor deposition,  catalysis and reaction engineering.  Collaborative research  is proposed with a Chinese laboratory which has demonstrated  a long term research experience in solid state ionics and  chemical vapor deposition.  Collaborative research  activities include (1) Metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition synthesis and electrochemical characterization of  the ceramic membranes at the Chinese laboratory and (2)  Electrical conductivity measurements of thin ceramic  membranes and hydrogen permeation/methane conversion  reaction on membrane reactors in the PI's laboratory.  The  collaboration will result in fast development of the novel  ceramic membrane reactor for effective conversion of methane  in an environmentally benign manner.  Experience gained  through the collaboration will help establish facilities for  electrochemical characterization of high temperature  ceramics and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition of thin  ceramic films in the PI's laboratory.",
