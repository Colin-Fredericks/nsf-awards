The theoretical  project  will  address   two  major  problems  in  the  phenomenology  of   high  temperature    superconductors:   (i)   the    equilibrium    and  nonequilibrium properties of the vortex liquid, with the goals of  the derivation of the currently assumed hydrodynamic description,  and   elucidation   of  the  vortex  states,  instabilities   and  dissipation  in the presence of currents parallel to the  applied  magnetic field; (ii) the freezing transition of the vortex liquid  into  a solid phase, which will consist of the development  of  a  new  mean-field description that explicitly shows  the  energetic  tendency  of  the vortices to order into a lattice and  which  is  generalizable  to  including the effects of  fluctuations.  These  research   efforts  will  be  complemented  by  the   educational  component  through new course development, and  incorporation  of  students at all levels into research.  %%%     This  is a CAREER grant t a young faculty member for a program  which  combines research and education.  The theoretical research  will  focus  on the properties of unique states of  matter  which  occur  in  the high temperature superconductors. The  educational  component  will  focus on course development and  integration  of  students at all levels into the research program.",
