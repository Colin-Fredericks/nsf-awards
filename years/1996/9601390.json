This history of the first fifty years of the menagerie's existence aims to  illuminate several related topics: (1) the functions originally conceived for the menagerie, and  how these functions were realized, revised or reformulated; (2) the animals included in the  menagerie and how they influenced scientific and popular understanding of animal nature; (3) the  problematic role living animals played in French zoology and in the life of the Museum; (4) the  character of scientific research practice as displayed in the studies of animal behavior conducted  at the menagerie by Cuvier.",
