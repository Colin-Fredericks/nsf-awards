 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal for the \"development of integrated laboratories in geography\" seeks $ 60,772 (from the NSF and internal resources) to establish, improve, and integrate the laboratories in the Department of Geography and Urban Studies on the main campus of Temple University. The goals are to (1) establish a laboratory for Physical Geography (PGLAB), (2) improve existing laboratories for Cartography (CARTLAB) and Geographic Information Systems (GISLAB), and (3) integrate the three laboratories physically and through teaching and research projects. In the three labs, students will learn the use of maps as models of the physical and built environment, create and import digital spatial and attribute data (through scanning, digitizing, image analysis, data conversion routines, etc.), transform the acquired data to appropriate projections and scales, create professional level output (in the CARTLAB), and conduct spatial analysis using overlays (in the PGLAB and GISLAB). The MacIntosh based CARTLAB facilities will be expanded, the 486 33 PCs currently serving the GISLAB will be moved to the PGLAB and replaced with Pentium 133's. In addition, some data, peripherals (for networking and data storage), and updated software licenses will be acquired. The PGLAB will serve as the primary point of entry and exposure to the world of digital mapping and spatial analysis through an University-wide core course on the physical environment. Interested students will then further specialize in mapping in the CARTLAB, and/or analysis in the GISLAB. Eighteen courses (including seven graduate undergraduate cross-listed courses) that will be wholly or partially taught in the labs are offered. Each year about 200 students, including about 140 undergraduate students, will receive training in and be familiarized with the use of computers in geography in the three teaching labs.",
