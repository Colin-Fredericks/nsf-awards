 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  proposed focuses on a two year series of summer  workshops,  with  an  evaluation  period, in Scientific Visualization.  These  workshops  are  scheduled for the summers of 1996 and  1997.  The  workshops  are  jointly sponsored by NSF  and  the  ACM  SIGGRAPH  education  committee. The co-PIs have successfully conducted  CCD  and  workshops in Computer Graphics, sponsored by  the  NSF.  The  workshops  have 3 separate objectives: provide participants  with  working   knowledge  of  scientific  visualization,  to   produce  curriculum materials, and to bring participants into an awareness  of  this  emerging discipline.  The concept for  these  workshops  builds  on  previous  foundation work done  by  the  professional  societies.   The  utility of these workshops  will  be  evaluated  after  the participants have had a chance to integrated this  new  knowledge  and curricular material within their own CS  programs,  by  formal  follow up by the PI. The results of  this  evaluation  will be reported to the community.    The   PIs   intend   to  actively  pursue  minority   and   women  participation   in   all  workshops.   They  have   linked   with  individuals  and  institutions at HBCUs  that  have  interest  in  participating in the workshops.",
