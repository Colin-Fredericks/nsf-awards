Central to the mission of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study in  the Southern Ocean is an understanding of the composition of the  planktonic food web, and the efficiency with which it transports  carbon to the deep ocean.  One of the specific questions being  posed is the mechanism of regulation of phytoplankton growth and  productivity in this area; light limitation, micronutrient  availability and grazing pressure have all been proposed to  explain the persistence of high macronutrient concentrations and  the relatively low productivity often observed.  To distinguish  among these mechanisms, this research examines photosynthetic  characteristics of phytoplankton in natural populations under a  range of environmental conditions.  specifically, it will  estimate, from chlorophyll fluorescence induction measurements of  individual cells, photochemical efficiency  and absorption cross  sections of photosystem 2(PS2) as well as relative pigment  content per cell for different groups of phytoplankton, which can  be distinguished either microscopically or flow cytometrically.  These measurements, carried out on samples from depth profiles  and experimentally-manipulated assemblages of phytoplankton,  should allow us to distinguish among limiting factors for  phytoplankton growth.  For example, limitation by micronutrients  should result in low photochemical efficiency (reflecting loss of  functioning PS2 reaction centers), while low-light limitation  (due to deep mixing) would be indicated by high fluorescence  (i.e., pigment content)  in near-surface cells.  Grazing control  would be implied if photosynthetic characteristics indicate no  limitation of intrinsic growth rates    The individual cell nature of the proposed measurements will  allow us to evaluate the condition of different groups of  phytoplankton (or different cells) in a  given water sample, and  to examine unambiguously the effects of environmental gradients  or experimental treatments on given species.  In addition, in the  course of the measurements, the composition of the phytoplankton  community will be characterized by microscopic and flow  cytometric analysis.  Observations of the physiological state of  cells in natural assemblages and experiments, combined with  information on community structure, will allow us to evaluate the  relative importance of light, iron, and grazing as limiting  factors for productivity in the Southern Ocean, and to better  interpret bulk measurements of phytoplankton properties, such as  can be obtained in a high resolution survey with FRR (fast  repetition rate) fluorometry.",
