 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program will   support research by Dr. Michael P. Castellani of the Chemistry   Department, Marshall University, on the reactivity of organometallic   radical compounds.  Electron deficient pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl   carbonyl compounds of Cr, Mo, and W will be synthesized and used to   prepare 17- and 19-electron species.  The relative stabilities of these   odd-electron species will be determined, as well as their physical   properties and reactivities.  In a related project, 15-electron   nitromethane complexes of chromium  will be prepared and used to   investigate the isomerization of  nitromethane to methyl nitrite.  This   reaction will be studied to determine if it is general for nitroalkanes.    Also,  related alkoxide and amido chromium complexes will be prepared and   their reactivity with alkenes and alkynes explored.  Organometallic compounds that have 18 electrons in their outermost energy   levels are generally less reactive than those that contain 17 or 19   electrons.  Some 17- and 19- electron species are thought to be important   intermediates in catalytic reactions.  This project focuses on   understanding factors important in the reactivities of some odd-electron   species, especially in reactions which may have utility for organic   synthesis.  The research will be carried out by undergraduate students",
