 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of problems in mathematical relativity and quantum  gravity will be carried out by Prof. Torre.  In mathematical  relativity advantage is taken of recent results on the jet  space structure of the vacuum Einstein equations.  In  detail, the modern theory of conservation laws, which  provides a practical framework for computing conserved  volume, surface and line integrals associated to a system of  field equations, is applied to the Einstein equations.  The  conservation laws of the Einstein equations with and without  Killing vectors are computed.  A general theory of  asymptotic conservation laws, which describes surface  integral conservation laws of solutions with a given  asymptotic structure, such as the ADM energy, is developed  and used to give a formalism for computing such conservation  laws for a large class of generally covariant field  equations and asymptotic structures.  These results are  applied to the problem of giving a definition of `dynamical  black hole entropy`.  Finally, recent results on symmetry  reductions of partial differential equations are used to  give general theorems on symmetry reductions of generally  covariant field equations for a spacetime metric.  In quantum gravity, work involves both canonical and path  integral methods of quantization of the gravitational field.  The problem of functional evolution in canonical quantum  gravity is addressed via symmetry-reduced models of general  relativity obtained by assuming the existence of two  commuting Killing vector fields.  These models are quantized  rigorously and consistently with respect to general  covariance.  The possibility of accomplishing a Dirac  quantization of a parametrized free field theory in  Minkowski space is addressed using techniques from algebraic  quantization.  Path integral quantization is studied using  Ashtekar variables.",
