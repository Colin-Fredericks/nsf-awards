 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529825  Yu    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project explores a compact, high-gradient electron linear accelerator as an injector to a multiport, high-throughput, synchrotron X-ray radiation storage ring.  The device will be used in X-ray lithography machines for manufacture of microelectronic chips and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  Phase I produced a compact design for a full-energy injector that matches well to a superconducting storage ring X-ray source.  A pulsed septum and kicker magnet were also designed for use with full-energy injection.  Phase II will produce a detailed design of the X-ray source system and run simulation tests of high current stored and maintained in the compact ring using the new injection scheme.  In concurrent Phase III development, under private-sector funding, a commercial prototype of a new full-energy, high-gradient injector will be built.  By subcontract to Oxford Instruments of Carteret, NJ, Phase II will also modify a Helios 2 superconducting ring for full-energy injection.    Potential commercial applications are expected in a new generation of high-throughput X-ray machines for lithography at feature sizes finer than 0.18 micron.  This is expected to enable a major expansion in quality and productivity of the microelectronics industry.  The new injection technology can also be adapted to MEMS microfabrication, which is also expected to grow significantly.",
