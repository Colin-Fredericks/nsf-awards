 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529804 Delong  The primary objective of this research is to  investigate the physiological properties, metabolic  activities and ecological significance of a newly discovered  abundant component of marine picoplankton: planktonic marine  archaebacteria. Recently results have demonstrated that  planktonic marine archaebacteria are widely distributed and  can be relatively abundant in marine prokaryote assemblages.  Available data suggest that these microorganisms may  significantly influence carbon and energy flux in marine  picoplankton.  In addition, since all other known  archaebacteria have unique metabolic and physiological  properties, it is quite possible that planktonic marine  archaebacteria have unique characteristics which influence  their ecological function, and qualitatively distinguish  them from other prokaryotic picoplankters.  This study will  investigate the qualitative properties of planktonic  archaebacteria, and their quantitative contributions to  picoplanktom biomass and production in the Santa Barbara  Channel.  Methods that selectively detect planktonic  archaebacterial presence, metabolites, and activities will  be used to assess their ecological significance.  Measurements of archaebacteria relative abundance and  distribution will be used to estimate their contribution to  picoplankton biomass.  Techniques that estimate  incorporation of radiolabel into specific archaebacterial  cellular metabolites (rRNA, lipids) will be used to  determine the relative flux of nutrients into planktonic  archaebacterial metabolic pools.  This study will provide  new information on a ubiquitous but, little understood  component of marine picoplankton.  The ultimate goal of this  research is to relate the unique properties, biomass, and  metabolic activities of planktonic marine archaebacteria to  the biological interactions and biogeochemical processes  through which they influence flows of energy and matter in  the sea. ***",
