 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests a new-generation, variable-vacuum  (pressure) scanning electron  microscope (SEM), for the central Bessey Microscopy Facility (BMF) at  Iowa State University, with a digital image enhancement system for  observing details more clearly with simple operation using automated  functions, and capable of providing high resolution (@ 3.5nm at 30 kV).  This instrument can be retrofitted with a cryopreservation system and a  x-ray energy dispersive detector already in use in the BMF. Certain  modern-day SEMs are able to provide both high-resolution, bright images  at high vacuum over a range of kVs and magnifications, and at low  vacuums and kVs to reduce specimen radiation damage and charging, but  also with good resolution. Need for a high performance, high resolution  SEM has become a basic requirement in biological sciences, and in other  diverse areas of scientific research. In addition, interest of using  SEM at a kV below SkV is also recognized in such applications as  studying intracellular ultrastructure, detection and identification of  5-10 nm colloidal gold markers for immunocytochemical labeling with a  backscattered detector, and particularly viewing beam sensitive and/or  unstable specimens such as food products and other delicate biological  samples which cannot withstand high accelerating voltages and beam  currents. These latter specimens can be preserved by using quick  freezing capabilities such as with a cryopreservation unit and a  propane jet freezer already available in the BMF. It is also important  to observe with increased resolution surface structures and fracture  faces of specimens and, at the same time, to provide x-ray elemental  analysis of localized substances within these surfaces. Compositional  information and corresponding surface ultrastructure can also be  determined and analyzed with a backscattered electron detector. Six  specific research projects have been identified on the Iowa State  University campus which would directly benefit  from a new-generation,  high-resolution, and variable-vacuum SEM with the above capabilities.  There are a number of other projects that would also benefit from this  new-generation SEM by a wide variety of other users of the BMF.",
