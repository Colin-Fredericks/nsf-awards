 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little has been done to learn why many bright, well-prepared young women do not see the fields  as people-oriented.  Their vision of a scientist is as an isolated and remote researcher, dealing  with concepts rather than with people.    This project is designed to alter this narrow view of science and mathematics.  The goal is to  present these areas, not only as exciting, fundamental research that alters the way in which we  see the world, but as essential knowledge on which to base policy decisions affecting the way we  live.  To present scientists as doing interdisciplinary research that has easily identified policy  impact, and to show that they do not work in isolation, will help, recast the image of science and  attract more women to its disciplines.    The format of the program includes a seminar course on topics in science that are fundamental to  certain policy areas (e.g., the environment, law, education, criminal justice, informatics.  It will  be followed by a two-months summer research apprenticeship, working with scientist who are  focusing on policy areas, and with those engaged in the formulation of science policy-on campus  and in government agencies an nonprofit research institutes in the Washington area.  Participants   would be recruited primarily from first year women students who have taken Advanced  Placement calculus in high school  but who have not indicated that they intend to major in  mathematics or science.",
