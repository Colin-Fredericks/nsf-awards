The workshop will be attended  by Japanese and US experts from academia,  industry and government laboratories.  The objectives of the workshop are to:  (1) assess recent developments in smart structure technology and their recent applications to large civil structures in the US and Japan, (2)  to identify research needs, gaps and future research thrusts and,  (3)  bring together researchers and practitioners from the US and Japan to explore and promote cooperative research activities through active participation of university, government and industry professionals.  This project is jointly supported by NSF and Building Research Institute, Ministry of Construction, Japan, under the auspices of the US-Japan Natural Resources (UJNR) Program.",
