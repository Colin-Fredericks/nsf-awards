 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tyler/Abstract           The objective of this research is to investigate the  combination of propagation, meteorological, and measurement  problems associated with an Earth occultation observing system.  In  comparison with exploratory measurements of other planets or  measurements of less dynamic and complex atmospheres farther from  the sun, occultation measurement of Earth's atmosphere is believed  to present a considerable challenge.  In the area of radio-wave  propagation, we will investigate the effects on radio occultation  measurements of:  (i) local departures from spherical symmetry in  the terrestrial atmosphere (e.g., due to weather fronts and  baroclinicity);  (ii) diffraction of radio waves, which will occur  frequently in terrestrial occultations (e.g., due to small-scale  gravity waves or abrupt refractive variations in the ocean boundary  layer);  (iii) multipath propagation, which occurs in connection  with complex refractivity structures and is at a minimum an  important factor in preventing reliable GPS/MET observations of the  lowest several km of the atmosphere;  and (iv) critical layers  (i.e., ducts) in the basic refractivity structure, which  fundamentally limit the region of the atmosphere accessible to  remote sensing through radio occultation.  With regard to item  (ii), the standard retrieval algorithm (Abel inversion) for radio  occultation data ignores diffraction effects and we will attempt to  develop (and apply) a new algorithm that, by properly accounting  for diffraction, can yield profiles at enhanced, sub-Fresnel-scale  vertical resolution.  These propagation effects will be studied  with the dual objectives of better understanding radio occultation  data already acquired with the GPS/MET instrument on Micro Lab 1  and of gaining insight toward the design of an advanced GPS  receiver that can be used to collect radio occultation data on  future satellite  missions.  With regard to the former, we will  analyze a subset of GPS/MET data with emphasis on areas  (e.g.,  studies of atmospheric waves) where the data have not yet been  fully utilized.",
