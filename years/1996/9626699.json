Handel, on the structure of   the outer automorphism group of a free group.  The methods used are a  mixture of techniques from E. Rips's theory of real trees and from the  train track theory of Bestvina and Handel.  The Principal Investigator  will also examine to what extent the JSJ theorem of Rips and Z. Sela  can be extended to splittings over other than cyclic groups.       Now is an exciting time to be a geometric group theorist.  Much  beautiful mathematics is devoted to classification results.  For  example, the classification of surfaces (spaces, such as the sphere, that  are locally the same as a plane) is classical.  This classification is  akin to Mendeleev's periodic table of the elements -- each surface  appears once and only once.  In recent years, due in large part to the  geometric ideas of W. Thurston, there has been great progress towards a  classification theorem for 3-manifolds (spaces that are locally like 3-  dimensional space).  Inspired by these manifold successes,  mathematicians have begun to look at groups from a geometric viewpoint.  (A group is a fundamental object found throughout mathematics and the  sciences.  Roughly speaking, a group is the set of symmetries of some  object.)  Mathematics has arrived at the point where the possibility of a  classification theorem for (geometric) groups can be envisioned.  For  example, a recent result of E. Rips and Z. Sela describes how to break  a group into more fundamental pieces.  In the current project, the  Principal Investigator will continue his research along these lines.  More specifically, he will show how to break up groups into fundamental  pieces in ways other than that of Rips and Sela.  Also, he will continue  his work with M. Bestvina and M. Handel undertaking a detailed study of  some of the groups that will play a key role in this classification.  ***",
