 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Geography and Earth Science trains earth science professionals and secondary teachers through instruction in the standard geology curriculum and the application of field and laboratory problems. To enhance this training program, the department is obtaining an x-ray diffractometer (XRD). This acquisition significantly improves the Geography and Earth Science curricula on two levels:  (1) students, most of whom are destined for employment in the environmental industry, can learn to use this device as an analytical tool with which geologic problems can be investigated and (2) many basic geologic concepts of mineralogy, petrology, and sedimentary geology can be taught by laboratory exercises employing the XRD, through which students become familiar with the theory and operation of the instrument. Execution of this project entails the integration of the XRD into three existing courses (Mineralogy, Petrology, and Stratigraphy and Sedimentation). In addition, applications of the XRD to various geologic problems are being taught in a new course (Laboratory Methods in Geology). Students are encouraged to utilize the power of this instrument in designing their own projects for the course in senior research.",
