 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624458  Hoelzle  Programmers have long been faced with the dilemma of choosing  between abstraction and efficiency: if they use abstraction  pervasively, their programs become more maintainable but may  execute too slowly.  Ideally, hiding a design decision behind an  abstract interface should have no impact on performance, so that  programmers can reap the full benefits of encapsulation without  fear of performance problems. Thus, abstraction-oriented  languages must employ aggressive compiler optimizations to reduce  the run-time overhead of abstraction. Since the ultimate goal is  to increase programmer productivity, these optimizations must be  compatible with interactive, exploratory programming  environments. The focus of this work is on reducing the cost of  abstraction in object-oriented languages, as well as,  complementary educational goals.  The objective of this project is to develop adaptive  customization, a compiler technique that aims to make aggressive  optimization practical by improving performance without unduly  increasing code size. Being suitable for interactive programming  environments, adaptive customization could dramatically improve  the performance of real-world applications written in dynamic  languages like Smalltalk, Self, Java, Dylan, or CLOS.  Not all dispatches can be optimized away, and the remaining  dispatches may become more expensive on superscalar processors.  Thus, the goal is to develop new dispatch techniques specifically  optimized for such processors. A comprehensive study of dispatch  performance on superscalar processors will be undertaken in this  project. Benchmark suites and tools  will be developed to support  this research.  ***",
