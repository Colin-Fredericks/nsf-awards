Andrej Nowakowski and Stanislaw Walczak of the Institute  of Mathematics of Lodz University.  The researchers will combine  their expertise in optimal control theory in the area of field  theory, the Dubovitskii-Milyutin method, and nonregular/abnormal  optimization problems to develop a broad and comprehensive theory  of sufficient conditions for optimality and optimal control  problems.  The notion of a field of extremals and/or dynamic  programming provide the theoretical basis both from a classical  viewpoint using generalizations of Hilbert's invariant integral  as well as from a modern perspective in the context of solutions  to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.  They will investigate  links between geometric properties of extremals and singularities  of the value function.  In particular, they will analyze the role  optimal abnormal extremals play in the construction of a regular  synthesis, viz., an optimal field of extremals.  They will give  special attention to control systems of Dirichlet type for which  currently only limited necessary conditions for optimality are  available.    This research in applied mathematics fulfills the program  objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and  Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas  of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of  equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.  ***",
