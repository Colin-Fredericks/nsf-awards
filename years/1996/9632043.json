 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632043  Murty    This GOALI grant supports an engineering student for a one  year period in industry to investigate the effects of alloy  chemistry and process factors on specific intermetallic  phases which influence zirconium alloy (Zircaloy) properties  and performance.  Intermetallics undergo changes in  structure that affect mechanical properties and corrosion  resistance.  The structural include phase nucleation, growth  and restructuring during material processing, and these  changes are strongly influenced by the concentrations of the  alloying elements.  Variables include beta-quench  temperature and quench rate, post-beta-quench cold-work and  annealing, and subsequent cold-work/anneal cycles to control  final precipitate morphology.  The research examines  corrosion (nodular and uniform), microstructure (with  particular attention to intermetallics), mechanical  properties, and manufacturability, evaluated using automated  ball indentation.  Zirconium alloy sheet material is used to  simulate tubing for ease of fabrication and testing.  The  study is performed in collaboration with the General  Electric Company's Zircaloy manufacturing center in  Wilmington, NC, and Vallecitos nuclear center in California.  %%%  Zircaloys are widely used in fission reactors as thin-walled  tubing for cladding nuclear fuel, intermediate grids,  channels (BWRs), and calandria tubing (PHWRs).  The research  program allows a student to learn on-site the metallurgical  factors associated with the application of this alloy.  ***",
