 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an investigation into three problems  involving the theta correspondence, the Siegel-Weil formula,  values and derivatives of  Eisenstein series and L-functions, and  algebraic cycles on Shimura  varieties. Problem I concerns the  basic properties of the local theta  correspondence, especially  the question of the first occurence.  Problem II concerns a  possible relation between the height pairings of  algebraic  cycles on certain Shimura varieties and the Fourier expansions of  central derivatives of Siegel Eisenstein series. Problem III   involves the application of the relation of Problem II to the  derivative,  at the center of symmetry, of certain Langlands  L-functions, generalizing the formula of Gross and Zagier.    The  research falls in the general mathematical area of the Langlands   program.The Langlands program is part of Number Theory, which is  the study of the  properties of the whole numbers and is the  oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in  number theory have  furnished a driving force in creating new  mathematics in other  diverse parts of the discipline. The  Langlands program is a  general philosophy that connects number  theory with calculus;  it  embodies the modern approach to the  study of whole numbers.  Modern number theory is very technical  and deep, but it has had  astonishing applications in areas like  theoretical computer  science and coding theory.",
