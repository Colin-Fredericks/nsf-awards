The studies will focus on the role of sensory  experience in the development of behaviors involving leg  movements in embryonic and early postnatal life.  Both  electromyogram (EMG) and kinematic recordings will be  quantitatively analyzed to identify effects of altered  sensory input or later behavior.  Specifically the goal of  the research is to explore the issue of whether, in what  way, and to what extent alterations in sensory input produce  changes in the development of walking.  There are four  objectives.  The first is to examine the role of sensory  experience in the postnatal development of walking.  The  effect of removing or altering input due to load  (resistance) or joint proprioception, will be analyzed.  This set of experiments will also look at recovery from  deficits are limited to walking or whether they generalize  to other locomotor or non-locomotor behaviors.  A second  objective is to further  examine the role of sensory input  in mature locomotion.  The third objective is to examine  similar issues in embryos.  This will help determine when  the mature responses to sensory stimuli develop and will  also examine how sensory input is involved in the embryonic  development of motor patterns.  Finally, the fourth  objective is to look  at the effects of skipping a step in a  developmental sequence.  The effects of eliminating  particular embryonic behaviors on the subsequent development  of walking will be evaluated.  Overall the data generated in  these studies will significantly increase our understanding  of the role of sensory experience in the development of  motor behaviors.",
