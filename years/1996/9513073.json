 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513073  Qu      This award supports US participation in a bilateral US-China  workshop on basic research issues and emerging technologies  in the areas of mechanics and processing of advanced  materials.  US participants will be chosen from applicants  within ten years of their Ph.D.  The purpose of the workshop  is to provide an opportunity for young investigators from  the two countries to exchange ideas and develop partnerships  for cooperative research in important areas of advanced  materials research.    The workshop topic is timely and of common interest. The  area of advanced materials is critically important to both  China and the US.  The Chinese PI, Dr. Yang Wei of Tsinghua  University, Beijing, earned a Ph.D. at Brown University and  is a regular contributor to refereed journals.  He was named  one of China's top ten young scientists in 1994, and  maintains strong research collaborations within and external  to China.  In a September 1995 report published by NIST on  materials research in China, a number of recommendations for  improving the cooperation in materials science were made.  One calls for increased scientist to scientist interaction  to define research opportunities for collaboratimn.  This  workshop should be an important first step in allowing new  US investigators to see the research programs in China and  to define where collaboration will advance US interests in  materials science.  The workshop will be held in August 1996  at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.  ***",
