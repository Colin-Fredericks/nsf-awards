 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding from the NSF's Academic Research Infrastructure Program will enable Grinnell College to renovate research laboratories in the Bowen Hall of Science.  Constructed in 1952,  space dedicated to the Department of Physics has never been renovated.  During the time when the floor plan for Physics was designed, research was very limited.  However, since the 1980's the level of research and research training activities have increased at a higher rate.  To accommodate this growth, the physics research and research training program began to utilize spaces originally designed for instruction that now cannot adequately support these functions. The renovation plan targets specific areas in physics where investigations in atomic, laser and optical physics, astronomy, and cryogenics research take place.  Funds will be used to reorganize laboratory space, update electrical, HVAC, plumbing systems, purchase new lab casework, and bring labs into compliance with ADA and safety standards. Not only will the completion of the project enable Grinnell faculty and students to perform research that is not feasible in the current facility, but it will help the Department integrate research experience with education, stimulating students to pursue advance studies in physics.",
