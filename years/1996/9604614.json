 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604614  Shinozuka    This is a three-year continuing award supporting a  collaboration between engineering research centers in the  United States and Japan.  The U.S. principal investigator is  Professor M. Shinozuka, Chairman of the Southern California  Earthquake Center's (SCEC) Standing Committee on Advanced  Technologies for Earthquake Disaster Mitigation.  This  Center is located at the University of Southern California.  The Japanese collaborator is Professor K. Irikura who is  located at Kyoto University's Disaster Prevention Research  Institute (DPRI). The project is jointly funded by the Japan  Program of the Division of International Programs and the  Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Program, Division of Civil and  Mechanical Structures, Directorate for Engineering.  The  grant aims at developing new strategies for earthquake  disaster prevention and mitigation based on experiences  gained during the Kobe and Northridge earthquakes.  Research  will involve utilizing advanced and emerging technologies  including smart materials, micro-sensors, precision  actuators, micro-computers, GPS, wireless and telemetric  communication and advanced robotics technology.  The  objectives of the project are: 1) to establish a university-  based US-Japan center-to-center research entity that will  identify, develop, and promote advanced technologies for  earthquake disaster mitigation; 2) to develop a computer-  aided support system that provides prompt and effective  emergency response and crisis management decisions based on  the rapid assessment of many factors for coordination uses  by national, regional and local governments; 3) to develop a  prototype integrated real-time monitoring system to detect  post-earthquake fire, damage, and malfunction; and 4) to  develop prototype intelligent robots to be used for search  and rescue, fire-fighting, and emergency demolition and  repair.    The Principal Investigators will be supported by an  Executive Committee consisting of eight researchers, four  from  each country, with responsibility for major research  management, policy, and strategy development and a Technical  Committee consisting of twenty experts on various fields,  ten from each country, with responsibility for advice on  technical issues.  Three workshops will be held, one a year,  to disseminate research results and accelerate the  development and utilization of the advanced technologies in  both countries and then throughout the world.  This award  supports research visits within Japan by U.S. senior  investigators, postdoctoral researchers and graduate  students.",
