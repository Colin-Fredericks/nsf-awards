 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program,  investigates the phenomenon of intermolecular   interactions.   Prof.  Krzysztof  Szalewicz of the University of Delaware   and collaborators will further improve symmetry-adapted perturbation   theory (SAPT) developed by them for dimer interactions, and a new version   applicable to trimers will be derived.  This theory allows transparent   physical interpretation of intermolecular potentials in terms of four   fundamental interactions:  electrostatic, exchange, induction, and   dispersion.  The theory is free from basis set superposition problems and   is computationally more efficient than the supermolecular many-body   perturbation theory approach.   High-level calculations of   state-of-the-art intermolecular potential energy surfaces for   experimentally relevant van der Waals dimers and trimers will be   performed.  These studies will help provide an understanding of the real   physical mechanism for the formation of van der Waals bonds and the   physical interactions that are responsible for minima, tunneling   barriers, and anisotropies of the potentials.  This work is expected to   assist interpretation of experimental data, particularly in the case of   three-body nonadditivities.   An important part of the project will   involve applications aimed at resolving current problems in the field   concerning interactions of rare gas atoms with various molecules such as   nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water, or ammonia, as well as dimers of those   molecules.  The trimers will include rare gas atoms, Ar2-HF, and the   water trimer. The current theoretical understanding of three-body   interactions is very unsatisfactory, in particular in view of recent   experimental activity in this field.  The SAPT method offers the   possibility of physical analysis of nonadditivities and of obtaining   accurate numerical values for them.  This project investigates the phenomenon of interactions between   molecules.  These interactions, much weaker than the chemical forces   binding atoms in molecules, are responsible for an extensive range of   physical, chemical, and biological phenomena: from the boiling of water   to the genetic code.  Standard computational chemistry methods, which are   very successful in describing chemical bonds, are inadequate in   describing these intermolecular forces.  Szalewicz and collaborators will   develop and use rigorous methods based on a quantum mechanical   description of these systems in order to provide a more complete   understanding of these molecular interactions.",
