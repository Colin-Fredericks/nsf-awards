Indications are that climate change occurs on  two characteristic time scales, roughly 1 - 3,000 years and 5 -  10,000 years.  Evidence for millennial-scale climate variability  has been found in ice cores drilled through the Greenland ice  sheet, sediment cores from the North Atlantic Ocean, pollen records  from both North America and Europe, and glacial deposits in North  America.  Paleoclimate records from the southern hemisphere also  show climatic variability on millennial time scales.  While  interhemispheric synchrony has been observed for the last  termination, the record of alpine glaciers and lake sediments in  the Andes and New Zealand now suggest that these higher frequency  changes may also be synchronous with the climatic fluctuations of  the Northern Hemisphere.  This award supports a project designed   to model the higher frequency variations of climate.  One of the  challenges of developing such a theory for millennial-scale climate  change will be to account for interhemispheric connections within  the context of a global environmental system.  While changes in the  thermohaline circulation of the ocean have been postulated as a  cause for rapid climate change on millennial time scales in and  around the North Atlantic, interhemispheric synchrony would  implicate the atmosphere as a key factor in global climate change  on this time scale.",
