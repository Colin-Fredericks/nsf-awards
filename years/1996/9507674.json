 "awd_abstract_narration": "The teeth of primates, both living and fossil, represent the most complete evidence of the  evolution, ecology, life history, and taxonomy of this important group.  The microscopic structure  of tooth enamel, a previously neglected aspect of tooth morphology, holds great promise for  increasing our understanding of primate dental function and phylogenetic relationships.  This  research will document enamel variation in a broad taxonomic sample of living and fossil  primates, and use these data to test specific functional hypotheses and to assess the  phylogenetic utility of enamel characters.  It represents an important step forward in the  comprehensive study of these rare biological and fossil specimens.  The research design consists of two components: 1) analysis of intraspecific and interspecific  variation in enamel in a broad sample of living primates and 2) analysis of enamel evolution,  based on comprehensive sampling of molar tooth enamel of fossil primates.  Analyses will be  based on scanning electron microscopy of histological specimens of mature enamel.  The  objectives of the study are:  1) To test the hypothesis that differences in occlusal enamel among  functionally distinct areas of molar teeth are linked to differential resistance to wear.  2) To test  the hypothesis of linkage between some enamel features and body size. 3) To test hypotheses of  functional constraints on enamel structure among developmentally and functionally distinct parts  of the dentition (e.g., incisors, canines, premolars, molars). 4) To explore the links between  enamel structure and diet using comparative study of closely related primates that differ in diet,  and statistical methods of matrix correlation analysis.  5) To assess the phyletic utility of enamel  characters among living primates, and, using phylogenetically reliable enamel characters, to test  hypotheses of relationships among fossil primates.  This research will be the most comprehensive study of primate enamel structure to date.  By  study of mechanically important enamel characters it will contribute to a broader understanding of  dental function and evolution in Primates.  Moreover, it will go a long way towards establishing  how enamel structure can and cannot be used to resolve questions of phylogeny and  systematics.",
