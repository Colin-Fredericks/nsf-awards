Dr. Rubin will work with Dr. Masaru  Matsuoka, Director of the Cosmic Radiation Laboratory at  RIKEN, on a research project entitled  \"Observations of  Cosmic X-Ray Sources\".    The proposed research will investigate the emission of  electromagnetic energy occurring in selected x-ray binary  systems with specific emphasis on the analysis of data  recorded by orbiting high energy observatories.  Soft x-ray  transients are a class of x-ray binaries containing a  neutron star for which outbursts of strong x-ray emission  are occasionally observed.  Modeling the high energy spectra  in both the quiescent and outburst states is critical to an  understanding of the physical structure and outburst  mechanisms of these systems.  The analysis will discriminate  between accretion and shock powered models of the quiescent  emission and thermal and non-thermal models of the outburst  emission.  Research will also focus on another class of x-  ray binaries, x-ray pulsars, which emit periodic signals due  to the rotation of an accretion powered neutron star.  Emission line observations of these systems will be used to  obtain information about the density and ionization  structure of the surrounding environment. The result of this  research in its entirety will be an improved understanding  of the nature of these enigmatic objects.  ***",
