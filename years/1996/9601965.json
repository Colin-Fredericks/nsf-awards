 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601965  Cunefare  This Academic Research Infrastructure Grant provides funding for the construction and instrumentation of an integrated structural acoustic research facility, including an anechoic chamber, at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The anechoic chamber will provide an echo-free environment for acoustic research.  The associated instrumentation and equipment, along with the chamber, are intended to provide an integrated design, analysis and experimental capability directed toward structural acoustics.  The facility will include: a scanning laser-bibrometer; a scanning acoustic intensity probe; a high-speed multi-channel data acquisition and control system; engineering workstations for modeling, control, and data acquisition; data acquisition and numerical modeling software, microphones; accelerometers; structural exciter; and signal conditioning components.    The facility is intended for research and education into the design of quiet, low vibration products.  Vibration and noise are significant contributors to perception of quality.  Excessive vibration and noise can lead to premature component failure, user fatigue, and stress.  The facility will provide the capability to numerically model the noise vibration, and determine means to control or tailor these characteristics. The benefit of this research is anticipated to be a better understanding of the generation and control of noise and vibration.  This improved understanding, if exploited by U.S. manufacturers in the design of their products, should improve the competitive position of their products.  Other intended research uses include experimental work related to the propagation mechanisms; transducer design and testing for the development of new instruments and sensor; active structural control, directed toward alternative means to control noise processes, and acoustic emission studies, for improved condition monitoring of equipment.",
