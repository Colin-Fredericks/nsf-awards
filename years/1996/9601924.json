 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601924  Gibbs    The major objective of the proposed research project is to acquire a 500 Mz wide bore Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with probes for flowing imaging, diffusion analysis, and electrophoresis.  The instrument requested is an AVANCE DMX 500 WB high performance digital nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, manufactured by Bruker Instruments, Inc. Manning Park 19 Fortune Drive, Billerica, MA  01821-3991.  The main purpose of this instrument will be for the performance of experiments in multiphase transport phenomena by faculty in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering.  Three key faculty members, Dr. Stephen J. Gibbs, Dr. Bruce R. Locke, and Dr. Rufina Alamo, will conduct experiments in transport in materials science, biochemical and biomedical materials, and polymers.  Dr. Gibbs is recently joining the faculty and comes with extensive experience in the applications and methodology of pulsed field NMR for transport studies.  Dr. Locke has funded research and extensive experience in a number of related projects that will utilize the instrument purchased on this grant;  the major focus of this work is on electrical field driven transport in biomaterials.  Dr. Alamo has funded research and extensive experience in the characterization of polymers.  Her focus will be on crystallization under flow conditions.  Additional faculty members from the Department of Chemical Engineering, including Dr. Pedro Arce and Dr. Michael Peters have expertise in the mathematical modeling and theoretical approaches for the analysis of macromolecular transport will collaborate with investigators on this grant.    The proposed instrument will be the focus of an interdisciplinary program that will included chemical engineers and other scientists from FAMU with common interests in the measurement of molecular transport.  Dr. Hsieh, from the Wetlands Ecology Department at FAMU is developing research in multiphase transport in soils and will utili ze this instrument in the future.  ***",
