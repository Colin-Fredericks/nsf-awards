These include:  (1) further studies of anomalous  coarsening kinetics at small volume fractions, fv; (2)  quantitative characterization of the evolution of the  concave cuboidal morphology that gamma prime precipitates  attain when fv is  small, and characterization of the spatial correlations  that eventually lead to rafting in nickel-base gamma/gamma  prime alloys; (3) investigations of gamma prime coarsening  at lower temperatures (T < 550 C) using magnetic analysis  to measure quantitatively the influence of coherency  strains and fv on the equilibrium coherent solubility  limits in Ni-X alloys, including Ni-Ti alloys.  It is also  proposed to initiate a new project on the coarsening  kinetics of Al3Sc precipitates in binary Al-Sc alloys.  The principal methods of analysis are dark-field  transmission electron microscopy (TEM), image-analyzing  software applied to scanned TEM negatives, magnetic  analysis to measure the variation of the solute  concentration of the matrix during gamma prime coarsening  in Ni-base alloys, and electrical resistivity to make  comparable measurements in Al-Sc alloys.  %%%  This research has relevance to microstructural formation  and stability in high temperature metallic alloys.  The  emphasis is  on  binary  nickel-base alloys, the principal  base  for superalloy development.  ***",
