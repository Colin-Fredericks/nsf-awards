In the domain of  tool use, one individual from  each of two social groups will be removed and taught a  different way to use the same tool to crack nuts.  Each  trained animal will then be returned to its group, and  opportunities for the group to observe the \"trainee\" and to  use the tool themselves will be provided.  The subsequent  pattern of tool use in the two groups will then be compared  to see if the different models of tool use made a  difference.  In the area of gestural communication, the  gestural signals of a group of chimpanzees at the Yerkes  Field Station will be documented.  As this is the same group  that has been studied previously, longitudinal comparisons  of gestural signals among the groups will be possible.  This  will provide experimental data on how the gestures are  learned socially.  Concerning cooperation, pairs of  chimpanzees will be presented with tasks in which  cooperation is required.  This will permit observations of  how the animals communicate about the task or otherwise  transmit information so as to coordinate their actions.  Determining precisely how chimpanzees transfer information  socially in these three behavioral domains is important  because it will help to elucidate the nature of the  mechanisms by means of which this species takes advantage of  the knowledge of groupmates.",
