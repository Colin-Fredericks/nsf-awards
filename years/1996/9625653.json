Animals must balance costs of movement  with potential benefits, and their strategies may be  affected both by genetic and ecological factors, and the  algorithms used to evaluate habitat.       Dispersal in the desert isopod, Hemilepistus reaumuri  will be studied.  The simplicity and manipulability of this  semelparous isopod s life cycle make it uniquely suited for  study of movement.  The costs of dispersal in the field, as  well as habitat selection and learning will be measured.  These measurements will be integrated in a dynamic model of  natal dispersal to understand how dispersal costs and  habitat quality affect dispersal strategies and decisions,  and how decisions can change with time and individual  condition.  Dispersal costs will be measured in terms of a)  survival as a function of distance or time dispersed, b)  time lost to growth or mate  attraction, and c) condition in  terms of lost energy or water and its effect on survival and  lifetime reproductive success.  Comparisons of the success  of naturally chosen breeding burrow sites and experimentally  imposed random sites will be made; the effects of past  experiences of habitat quality and its variability on  selectivity and dispersal distance will also be examined.",
