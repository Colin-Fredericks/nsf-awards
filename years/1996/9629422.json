One example is the recent application of DNA  profiling analyses to studies of avian mating systems, that  have  shown  that many young are sired by males other than their social  father  (i.e., the male in attendance at the nest).  Such  extra-  pair fertilizations call into question a basic assumption of many  models in behavioral ecology; i.e., reproductive fidelity between  mated  pairs.   Although  several  studies  have  addressed   the  selective benefits that females might receive by copulating  with  extra-pair  males,  relatively few have examined  the  ecological  conditions that lead some females, but not others, to  engage  in  such  copulations.  At  the core of the career  development  plan  proposed here is a four-year research project designed to examine  the  ecological  basis of extra-pair copulations  in  a  socially  monogamous  passerine,  the  black-throated  blue  warbler.   The  primary  objective  of this research project is  to  discriminate  among  four hypotheses to explain female reproductive strategies.  This  objective  will  be  achieved by  using  molecular  genetic  techniques,   in   combination  with   observations   of   marked  individuals and experimental field manipulations, to examine  the  ecological and social factors thought to affect female  behavior.  Multilocus DNA profiling and PCR-amplification of SSR  loci  will  be  used  to identify young sired by extra-pair males  and  their  sires, and experimental field manipulations will be used to  test  for  associations among territory quality, male genetic  quality,  female  settlement, male behaviors and extra-pair fertilizations.  In  addition,  these  data  will also  be  used  to  achieve  two  secondary  objectives: (1) the selectiv e benefits  of  extra-pair  copulations  to females in this population will be  examined  and  (2)  extra-pair  sires  will  be  identified  to  determine  true  reproductive  success.   Thus, this study  will  yield  a  better  understanding of the ecological causes and consequences of extra-  pair copulations, as well as a better understanding of how sexual  selection operates in socially monogamous species.        Although  molecular biology techniques have  revolutionized  almost  every discipline in biology, only recent have  they  been  applied  to  ecological research.  This career  development  plan  proposes an education program in molecular exology that will meet  this need in the training of graduate and undergraduate students.  The  education  program consists of:  (1)  a  lecture  course  in  exological  genetics, (2) a lab course in  this  subject,  (3)  a  molecular  ecology  journal  club,  (4)  direct  supervision   of  students   conducting  research  in  molecular   ecology.    This  education  program will be closely integrated with  the  proposed  research program.",
