 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Portland Community College (PCC) project creates an opportunity for science and non-science majors to increase their understanding of physical laws of nature as they apply to chemistry by using computer-interfaced instrumentation. PCC requests support from the National Science Foundation to acquire a modern Fourier Transform Infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) for the chemistry department at PCC, Sylvania Campus, and critical pieces of molecular biology equipment to be housed at the Center for Research on Occupational and Environmental Toxicology (CROET). The acquisition of this equipment will create a dual-site instructional laboratory that will provide opportunities for introductory and advanced learning and training for the workforce for PCC students. The dual-site will also provide opportunities for faculty enhancement. The link between a community college such as PCC and a research institution such as CROET is innovative and will be a national model for the improvement of undergraduate laboratory instruction.",
