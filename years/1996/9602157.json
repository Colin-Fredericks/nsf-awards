 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, thermal  noise arises from any mechanism that dissipates mechanical  energy.  This means that a gravitational wave interferometer  test mass and its suspension will work better, the lower is  the level of dissipation.  The Syracuse group will carry out  studies of various test mass and suspension designs,  characterizing them by their dissipation levels.  One means  of doing this is to measure the quality factors of the  various mechanical resonances in the system.  A novel  method, newly developed by the Syracuse group, involves  careful measurement of the response of the system after a  steady stress has been released.  Both methods will be  employed in the search for the best ways to build and  suspend test masses for LIGO.  In order for the search for gravitational waves to succeed,  it is necessary that detectors be free from disturbing  influences that can mimic or mask the weak gravitational  wave signal.  Thermal noise, also known as Brownian motion,  is among the noise sources most in need of reduction.  The  aim of the research program of the Syracuse University group  is to understand the sources of thermal noise in  interferometric detectors of gravitational waves (such as  those of the LIGO Project), and to thereby learn ways of  minimizing its strength.  In addition to its main goal of  improving the performance of LIGO and other gravitational  wave detectors, this work may stimulate progress in  understanding the structure of noncrystalline solids, such  as the fused silica from which test masses are made.",
