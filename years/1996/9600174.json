Dr. Nicolaides will  work with Dr. Hideo Tomioka, Professor of Engineering, on a  research project entitled, \"Computational Studies of  Novel  Carbenes and Nitrenes.\"    The proposed research focuses on an effort to design,  synthesize, and characterize novel compounds containing  carbenic and/or nitrenic centers linked by strong  ferromagnetic coupling units.  In contrast to normal organic  compounds, carbenes and nitrenes interact strongly with  magnetic fields, making them promising building blocks for  the synthesis of organic materials with magnetic properties  comparable to or even better than those of metals.  The  proposed research aims at understanding how the life-time of  such reactive species can be extended, while both preserving  their desirable magnetic properties and understanding how  such properties can be improved.  Although this is a  relatively new topic of research, the compounds being tested  are highly reactive and, as such, are of a high scientific  and technological significance.  ***",
