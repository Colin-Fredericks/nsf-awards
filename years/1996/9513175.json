 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study fossil soils and grasses as evidence for Middle Miocene grasslands in  East Africa and their role in the evolution of apelike ancestors of humans. The role of grasslands  in human evolution has been debated since Charles Darwin's day, and the existence of Middle  Miocene (14 Ma) grasslands in Kenya has continued to be controversial. Several lines of  evidence now converge to indicate Middle Miocene grasslands in Kenya: (1) isotopic study of  carbonate in fossil soils and apatite of mammalian teeth indicating tropical grassy vegetation, (2)  fossil soils similar to those of modern grasslands (Mollisols), (3) grazing muzzle and tooth  scratching on antelope fossils, and (4) fossil grasses with the abundant opal (phytoliths) and  scarce pores (stomates) of open country grasses. These findings are in some cases based on only  preliminary studies and now need to be extended to more sites of Middle Miocene age (13-16  Ma) scattered through southwestern Kenya: Ombo, Majiwa, Maboko, Nyakach, Fort Ternan,  Serek and Kapsibor. Fossil soils at each site will be described and sampled for laboratory  analysis. Fossil grasses will also be collected and returned to the laboratory for the microscopic  examination needed to identify them using a computer database. Also planned are isotopic  studies of the grasses and fossil soils to determine the kinds of grasses and vegetation present  (C3 or C4 grasses). This project builds on the highlights of a previously successful program to  provide a detailed view of the physiology, nature, botanical composition and extent of the  earliest East African grasslands.",
