 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaboration in logic programming  between US groups, including students, at SUNY Stony Brook  and Southern Methodist University, led by Terrance Swift of  SUNY Stony Brook, and the Universidade Nova de Lisboa in  Portugal, led by Professor Luis Moniz Pereira.  They will  create a sequential engine capable of performing central  aspects of non-monotonic reasoning to develop a robust,  scalable, freely-available system that will make possible  the use of logic programming for such applications such as  diagnosis, planning, and hypothetical reasoning over  databases.  They also propose to develop a distributed  version of XSB combined with PVM-Prolog to form a system  capable of performing non-monotonic reasoning in a  distributed, agent-like environment.  The USB-SMU group has strengths in the fundamental theory of  computational logic and in implementing these theories in  usable logic-based systems.  The UniNova group has strengths  in the theoretical development of expressive logic systems  with negation and in the application of these systems to  real-world problems.  They share an interest in  implementation and evaluation strategies.  Both groups have  begun to explore, in different ways, distributed non-  monotonic reasoning, which will address situations in which  the knowledge itself is distributed, and will model agent-  like argumentation systems that can share knowledge  non-  monotonically.  The US group will provide efficient  implementation of expressive systems, the Portuguese, an  expansion of the utility of the US systems, through  increased expressiveness and new applications.",
