 "awd_abstract_narration": "An  introductory  course  in modeling of  dynamic  systems,  with  special  emphasis  on chemical and ecological problems,  will  be  developed.  The  target student population  will  be  first-  and  second-year   social-science   and   humanities   students,   but  upper-division students and interested science majors will not be  excluded.  Rather  than placing emphasis on mathematical  methods  and  techniques used in modeling, attention will be  centered  on  salient  aspects  of complex-system behavior  as  illustrated  by  models     constructed     using    the    commercially-available  software-package  STELLA  II. Relatively straight-forward  models  dealing  with  chemical  reactions  will  be  used  to  introduce  fundamental  features  of complex-system  dynamics.  Problems  of  ecological  and  demographic  interest,  at  moderate  level   of  difficulty,  will  then be covered. The origin  and  behavior  of  \"deterministic  chaos\" will be treated using examples  from  both  chemistry and ecology. In the last third of the course,  students  will work in small groups (or individually) developing their  own  models,  each related to a specific problem of current  interest,  preferably  in  fields of the students' major academic  interest.  Opportunity will be provided for some outstanding students to use  less \"user-friendly\" software such as ODEPACK to deal with models  involving  \"stiff\" differential equations. The last  exercise  of  the  course  will  be a poster-session, at which individuals  and  groups will present their project-models to other members of  the  class,  and  to guests. The main aims of the course  will  be  to  facilitate  development of the students' insight with respect  to  types  of  functioning  to be expected  of  complex  networks  of  relationships,  and therefore in important natural  systems,  and  also to engender an appreciation of the power and limitations  of  modeling techniques.",
