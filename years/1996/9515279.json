 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines a series of political ideas that bear on science:  the political meaning of the neutrality claim in science; the nature of decision-making and discretion with respect to science;  the problem of meaningful discussion, especially in relation to democratic procedures; the nature of scientists' actions as representatives of science to other scientists and to external audiences; and the problem of agency, which is in part the problem of assuring the funders of science that what they are funding is valuable.  Agency relationships involve persons acting as agents for others, where the special knowledge and conduct of the agent cannot be readily judged by the buyer of the services.  The research will identify and compare historical alternatives with respect to the delegation of decision-making power, and the general constraints on the political organization of science and its relation to users, particularly the state.  Sources of authority and constraint, under the headings of neutrality, agency, and representation, will be examined  The overall goal is to identify the political means by which science constructs a domain within which these claims are recognized as legitimate.  This award supports the aspect of that research focused on the problem of agency in relationship to neutrality and representation, that is to say the contract between science and society, including the problem of the justification of a state role in science and the implications of this relationship for the internal organization of science and the self discipline of science.  The project is directed at the production of a major book that will update the political theory of science in the light of later criticisms of science and the literature of science and technology studies, recent work in the history of science, and current changes in the political atmosphere for science.",
