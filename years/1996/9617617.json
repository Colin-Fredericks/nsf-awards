A major international focus will be the work of the International Group of Funding Agencies for Global Change Research (IGFA).  IGFA is presently addressing issues such as arrangements for support of international project offices (IPO's) for global change research projects; refining its initial assessment of reservations and data management required for global change research;  observations and data management required for global change research; and needs and potential opportunities for cooperation between research funding and development aid agencies in support of global regional activities such as those of the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI); Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN); and European Network for Research in Global Change (ENRICH).  ***",
