 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central goal of this project is the development of  advanced time-resolved FTIR instrumentation which will allow  for the first time the investigation of a wide variety of  biological systems at the sub-nanosecond to millisecond  range. The proposed instrument will incorporate novel  features which will address the major short-comings of  current time-resolved FTIR instruments. The project will be  supported by the newly formed Center for Photonics Research  at Boston University and Bruker Instruments, Inc., a leader  in time-resolved FTIR instrumentation    In recent years it has been demonstrated that Fourier  transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy can  provide detailed information about dynamic changes in the  protonation state, local environment and orientation of  specific amino acid residues in proteins. This ability is  enhanced by the recent development of powerful new methods  for band assignments by the introduction of site-directed  isotope labels (SDIL) into proteins. However, the current  generation of FTIR instruments have fallen short of their  promise for probing rapid conformational changes in  biomolecular systems. Existing limitations are related to  the lack of sufficiently powerful broad-band infrared  sources, the relatively slow cycle-time or irreversible  response of most biological systems upon activation, the  prevalence of biological systems activated by mechanisms  other than light, and the need to simultaneously monitor  changes in the infrared and UV-visible absorption of a  sample.    We propose to develop a unique step-scan FTIR system with  the ability to record simultaneous sub-nanosecond to  millisecond infrared and W-visible absorption changes in  biomolecular systems. The instrument will be based on recent  breakthroughs in technology for ultra-high intensity  broad-band continuous (CW) and pulsed IR sources, rapid  sub-nanosecond transient recorders and infrared detectors  and step-scan interferometers. The development of a novel  synchronized  sample step translator (SSST) will make it  possible to shorten dramatically measurement times and open  the door to the investigation of dynamic processes in a wide  variety of biomolecular systems under physiological  conditions, including systems not activated by light,  systems with very slow cycle times and systems with  irreversible processes. By combining this proposed FTIR  instrumentation with the recently developed method of SDIL  and site-directed non-native amino acid replacement (SNAAR),  breakthroughs are expected in the fields of protein folding,  enzyme mechanism, ion transport and signal reception.  Transfer of the developed technology for future commercial  use will be facilitated by the close interaction during the  project with Bruker Instruments and through the Center for  Photonics Research",
