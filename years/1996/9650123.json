 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department is undergoing a major improvement of its Modern Physics Laboratory Course. This course is a student's first exposure to independent experimental work, and gives students the initial tools and experiences necessary to competently execute future independent work, including honors projects, summer internships at National Labs, and technology jobs in the industrial sector.   Improvement of the lab can be realized by the development of four permanent computer stations for the measurement, control, and analysis of nonlinear systems. A sequence of four new modern physics experiments is being developed (bouncing ball, string vibrations, double scroll circuit, and capillary ripples) to provide students with an experimental knowledge of the rudiments of low-dimensional, nonlinear time-series analysis (also known as chaos theory), as well as the rudiments (at the level of the quadratic map) of the theory of nonlinear systems. Participants are developing a nonlinear signal analyzer using LabViewlHiQ, which assists students in their exploration of experimental nonlinear systems. This nonlinear signal analyzer can be distributed over the Internet to other students and instructors wishing to build on this project.    The hope is that students_enchanted by both the complexity and comprehensibility of these everyday nonlinear phenomena (bouncing balls, strings, and ripples)_will want to pursue additional scientific studies of their own based on the confidence and competence resulting from these labs.",
