 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630128  Staehelin    This is a workshop (to be held March 18, 1995, in Tamarron, Colorado, as part of the Keystone Plant Extracellular Matrix Symposium)  to explore an emergent frontier in cell biology, the chaperone function of proteins (and perhaps oligosaccharides) which recognize glycans and are transiently involved in the folding, assembly, processing, and intracellular traffic of glycoconjugates, including glycoproteins, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides.  The workshop has a dual purpose, to present new research in the area and to assess the utility of the paradigm on an interkingdom level.  Invited platform presentations representing current interkingdom work will discuss new data on the assembly, processing, and traffic of glycoconjugates.  Featured topics will include the chaperone functions of calnexin and calreticulin, the role of N-glycans in sorting to the apical domain of polarized mammalian cells, and the role of accessory polysaccharides and proteins in assembly and function of the cell wall.  Short oral presentations will be selected from participants at the meeting wishing to present data which support or question the paradigm.  A panel of discussants will, with audience participation, help assess how the presented work relates to chaperone function.  ***",
