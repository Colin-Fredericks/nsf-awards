 "awd_abstract_narration": "Correct model specification is arguably the most critical  aspect of reliable time series analysis.  In the past decade,  significant advances have been made so it is now possible to  analyze a time series as non-gaussian or non-linear.  Therefore,  it is desirable to have reliable tests for determining linearity  or non-linearity and to have comprehensive tools for performing  proper analysis.    An initial investigation of existing bispectral-based tests  for gaussianity and linearity of a time series revealed many  areas for study.  Examinations of different functions of the  bispectrum and normalized bispectrum for various types of  non-linearity will be conducted.  A second area of investigation  is the development of a test statistic that will not result in  vastly different values when different smoothing procedures are  used in estimating spectral quantities.  It is the hope of the  principal investigator that after such examinations are  conducted, a test statistic will be developed that not only  reliably tests for linearity, but will aid in diagnosing  the type of non-linearity when rejecting the null hypothesis.    A second goal of this research is to continue to develop a  time series analysis package in S-Plus which will include devices  for analyzing non-linear time series.  The package will have  functions that may be used for linear and non-linear time series  analysis.  Since the package is in S-Plus, graphical examination  of relevant time series quantities is a \"built-in feature.\"   Documentation will also be developed.  When complete, the  package, along with documentation, will be submitted to statlib  for public use.",
