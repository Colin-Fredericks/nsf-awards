 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is obtaining a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with microanalytical (EDX) capabilities. This instrument is to be used by students and faculty for instruction and undergraduate research. Previously absent from the instructional resources is the ability to image and nondestructively analyze samples at the micron and submicron levels. The department wants undergraduates to understand how reductionism can be used to understand the structure, function, and properties of materials encountered in the classroom and everyday life.   A user-friendly SEM system with tremendous flexibility has been chosen for a diversity of applications within the College of Science. Undergraduates encounter this technology in both introductory and advanced laboratory exercises. Additionally, the SEM can be made available to the ever growing number of undergraduates involved in scientific research. Through laboratory exercises and independent studies, it is estimated that this equipment affects approximately 950 undergraduate students each year. Additionally, community involvement can be ensured by interaction with local schools and through special programs for precollege, high school, and middle school students hosted by the university.",
