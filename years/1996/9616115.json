 "awd_abstract_narration": "The challenge in biology is increasingly not the  availability of data or even of computational power, but  rather the ability to interpret results and effectively  apply computer hardware advances to critical scientific  problems. In particular, the explosion of sequence and three-  dimensional structural information is fundamentally changing  biology by extending our understanding of many basic  biological processes to the atomic level. The fields of  biology, mathematics, physics, and chemistry find common  ground in exploring biological structure-function  relationships. To fully exploit this paradigm shift,  analytical software aimed at this juncture between fields  must be made accessible to the scientific community. Even in  the field of structural biology, where advances have  previously paralleled the increased speed and affordability  of computers, the software to perform essential tasks  consistently runs behind this rapid hardware development,  and many aspects of high-end and parallel computing are  dramatically under-utilized. Yet, scientists developing new  computational methods for use in their own specific fields  and projects are hard-pressed to develop and support  generally usable software that takes full advantage of new  hardware.    The Computational Center for Macromolecular Structure  (CCMS), is a three-institution project that unites  researchers at The Scripps Research Institute, the  University of California at San Diego, and the San Diego  Supercomputer Center to meet this challenge. As a  collaborative structural biology effort between scientists,  applied mathematicians, and software engineers, CCMS is a  productive way to develop and disseminate new techniques for  determining and analyzing macromolecular structures and to  bring high-end computing power to the user's workstation via  the network. This Group Proposal seeks continuing support  for CCMS to develop, distribute, and support innovative  software for advancing research on biological macromolecules  at  the interface of biology, applied mathematics, computer  science, and chemistry.",
