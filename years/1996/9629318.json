 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    PI:  Basolo  Proposal number:  9629318       A Comparative Study of a Preference in Live-bearing Fishes     Research Component:  This project will investigate the  historical basis of a preference for a male trait and  examine changes in the preference over time.  Preferences  can appear prior to male traits, and can affect male traits  when they arise.  Although there is mounting evidence that  such a mechanism for selection can be important, little is  known about the history of such preferences and  how they  might change.  Males in many fish species in the genus  Xiphophorus  possess an elongated portion of the caudal fin,  the sword.  Females in this genus, as well as in the sister  genus which lacks a sword, have a preference for swords.  These results, combined with historical evidence, suggest  that this preference appeared prior to the appearance of a  sword.  The proposed research will test whether the strength  of the preference favoring a sword has changed in the  history of this group of fishes and their relatives.    Education Component:  The use of both established and  innovative teaching methods are proposed as a means to  broaden and improve student learning.  To enhance learning  in an Animal Behavior lecture course, cooperative learning  groups, an electronic news group, a course world-wide web  site, and email interchanges with scientists at other  universities are proposed.  To increase the students  appreciation for and understanding of animal behavior, a  laboratory-based course, Experimental Methods in Animal  Behavior, will be developed.  Principles covered will  include classical methods, as well as new techniques,  including paternity analysis and the use of digitally-  altered videos to test behaviors.",
