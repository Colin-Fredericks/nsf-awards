 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY                The Biology Department of Temple University requests funds to  support the purchase of a scanning confocal laser microscope,  which will be used to complement the other facilities that we  have available for a combined research/training program in  advanced microscopy. For many years, we have been assembling the  components of a \"virtual laboratory\" for advanced biological  microscopy. These components include electron microscopes, low  light fluorescence microscopes, DlC/Side band microscopes, and a  variety of image analysis systems which are run on PC's,  PowerMacintosh, and Silicon Graphics computers. This distribution  of the components will be discussed in the management section of  this application. It is our goal to complete this laboratory by  adding a scanning confocal system, which will allow us to add  three dimensional analysis to our repertoire. This laboratory  will be used in both research and training at all levels within  the department.    1. Research.          Drs. Gruberg, Myers, Hilfer, Tompkins and Sheffield are  interested     in using a scanning confocal microscope to  visualize biological     materials in three dimensions during  development. Drs. Gruberg, Myers,  Sheffield and Tompkins are  particularly interested in nerve development,     using several  model systems, and Dr. Hilfer is interested in the     cellular  basis of shape determination in embryos, with particular  reference to components of the sensory system. All of these  investigators have established research programs and significant  publication records.          This instrument will be an important resource for the  University     Neuroscience Program, which shares faculty from  the Health Sciences      Campus and this one.    2. Training.            The microscope will support our training mission as a       component of formal classes and the training of graduate and       undergraduate students. a. It will be incorporated into an       undergraduate/graduate course i n advanced microscopy. This       course was recently added to our curriculum, using the       existing equipment. The confocal microscope will be a       critical addition to the available instrumentation .         b. It will be available for undergraduate and graduate       student use during independent study/research courses, and       during thesis research. We have an active research program       supporting graduate students (about 50), and undergraduates       (about 30). In the undergraduate program, students work       individually with faculty for periods that average two       years, during which they carry out independent research       projects. Many of these projects have resulted in the       publication of research papers with the student as       co-authors. The undergraduate research program has been       supported by the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates       program for the past six years, and we have recently       received a three year grant to continue this effort. In       addition, the major portion of the grant that we have just       received from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute is       designed to support student research.          The major component of our graduate program, at both the       Master's and Doctoral level is research, carried out in       close association with a faculty advisor. The five faculty       who are participating in the current application currently       supervise research of 23 graduate students.",
