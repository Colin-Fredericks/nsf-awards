 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infrared (IR) analysis is one of the most commonly used analytical methods, especially in organic chemistry. A dispersive IR is too slow for use by larger classes and is not well adapted for analysis of solid samples. This project represents a 10-year emphasis on the improvement of the student laboratory experience including increased hands-on use of significant instrumentation. An upgrade of the IR instrumentation enhances the quality of the student laboratory experience.   The department is incorporating Fourier-transform-infrared (FTIR) based experiments in freshman- through senior-level courses. The speed and accuracy of the FTIR allows the performance of experiments that were not feasible with a dispersive IR. With the diffuse reflectance attachment, solids as well as liquid samples can be analyzed readily.   Four new experiments in the freshman-level courses for majors, minors, and liberal arts students introduce the freshmen to the FTIR. The major program enhancement occurs in organic chemistry, where 14 experiments are being enhanced by the use of FTIR analysis of reagents, products, and unknowns. The ability to analyze solid samples with IR is a major improvement in the organic laboratory. A new polymer kinetics experiment in Physical Chemistry utilizes the speed of the FTIR. A quantitative IR experiment with an environmental application is being introduced in Instrumental Methods, and a new experiment which demonstrates H-bonding effects is being introduced in Biochemistry.   The FTIR is also being utilized in the summer research program (SEURP), especially in Organic Chemistry projects.",
