 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple network services include guaranteed real-time service, predicted  real-time service, and best-effort service. While there has been extensive  research on designing traffic management algorithms for each individual  service, it is unclear how these algorithms can be integrated into one  network and how they will interact with each other. This problem becomes  more complex when the network also needs to support link-sharing, which  allows resource sharing among applications that require different network  services but belong to the same administrative class.  The service  disciplines at the switching nodes, which determine the order in which  packets are serviced, play a critical role in controlling the interactions  among different traffic streams, different service classes, and different  link sharing classes. The hypothetical Fluid Fair Queueing (FFQ)  discipline, which can serve multiple traffic streams simultaneously  according to pre-specified service shares, provides an ideal framework to  integrate traffic management algorithms for different services and link  sharing. Since FFQ uses an idealized fluid model that cannot be implemented  in the real-world, Packet Fair Queueing (PFQ) algorithms are needed to  approximate its behavior. Previously proposed PFQ algorithms including the  most popular Weighted Fair Queueing all introduce substantial inaccuracy in  approximating FFQ, which significantly affects traffic management and link  sharing algorithms. It is unclear whether accurate PFQ's exist, and if they  do, whether they can be simple enough to be implementable at high speed.  The goal of this research is to demonstrate that accurate and practical PFQ  algorithms can be designed and that they provide the foundation for a  framework under which traffic management algorithms for different services  and link sharing can be supported in an integrated fashion. Aspects treated  include (a) the fundamental tradeoff between complexity and accuracy of PFQ  algorithms; (b) issues in integrating different traffic management  algorithms and link-sharing into one framework and fundamental tradeoffs  between accuracy of PFQ algorithms and the efficiency of link-sharing and  traffic management algorithms; (d) admission control algorithms for  providing end-to-end performance guarantees using PFQ algorithms under not  only rate-proportional but also general resource assignments; e) more  flexible real-time services such as renegotiated service and rate-adaptive  service based on PFQ algorithms.  The study is conducted via a combination  of analysis, simulation, and implementation. The results of this work will  have a significant impact on the design of integrated traffic management  algorithms in both the Internet and ATM environments.",
