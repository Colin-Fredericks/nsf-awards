 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multi-user group application proposes to acquire the  necessary instrumentation to allow accurate quantitation of DNA, RNA,  and protein at the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center Campus.  This instrumentation will include one phosphorimagel and accessories  with an attendant computer for image processing and data analysis, and  a rewriteable optical disk drive for archiving data. Currently, we have  state-of-the-art facilities that support cell biology, genetics and  most other aspects of molecular biological research. However, a rapid  means for quantitative and qualitative analyses of DNA, RNA, and  protein are not currently available on the Oklahoma City Health Science  Center Campus. Instead, we must rely on autoradiographs, densometric  scans of autoradiographs, or gel slices with scintillation counting for  quantitation. In addition to providing a quantitative analysis of  nucleic acids and proteins, a phosphorimager will allow investigators  to reduce the amount of radioactive nuclides in their experiments  because of the increased sensitivity of the instrument.                Research projects in the Departments ol Mlcrohlology an  lmmunology, Pathology, Pediatrics, Opthamology, and Anatomical Sciences  that will immediately benefit from this facility include: i) three  projects that examine virus transcription, translation, and replication  (Palumbo, Kennedy, and Lloyd), ii) four projects that examine  transcriptional and translational regulation of procaryotic gene  expression (Dyer, Ferretti, Stull, Gilmore), iii) two projects that  examine receptor expression (Palumbo, Dyer), iv) a project that will  determine physical and genetic map of Streptococcus pyogeMes isolates  (Ferretti), v) four projects that will examine cytokine and chemokine  levels and mRNA levels (Murphy, Grammas, Pereira, Cunningham), vi) a  project that will examine the polymorphism of MHC loci in minority  populations (Hildebrand), vii) a project to quanti tate levels of  radiolabelled protein incorporated into membranes (Tweten); viii) and  two projects that examine expression of cellular genes including  enzymes involved in arachidonate metabolism, metalloproteinases, and  smooth muscle actin (Palumbo, Howard, and Tomasek). Every project is  currently supported by national extramural funding (NIH, USDA, etc.) or  \"local\" funding from the Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science  and Technology (OCAST) or the Presbyterian Health Foundation.                Intertwined with, and an essential component of this scientific  enterprise, is significant training in basic molecular biology and  protein chemistry. This training includes the ongoing research  education of post-doctoral fellows and graduate students within the  Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the other Departments.  Further, several programs in the Department and the University support  research training for undergraduate students, minority high school  teachers and minority high school students. Thus, the phosphorimager  will significantly enhance the research and research training  environment within the Department of Microbiology and Immunology and  the Health Science Center Campus in general.                Although the phosphorimager will be housed in the Department of  Microbiology and Immunology, the facility will be available to all  investigators on the Oklahoma City campus, subject to investigators  purchasing their own phosphorimaging plates and user fees to help  defray costs tour a maintenance agreement. Thus, this instrument will  have significant impact outside the Department, enriching the research  and research training capability of the entire University of Oklahoma  Health Science Center campus. Consistent with this potential, we have  obtained significant institutional support for the acquisition of a  phosphorimager, as the Health Sciences Center has pledged 30% of the  funds needed to purchase the instrumentation.",
