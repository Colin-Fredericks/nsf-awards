This award provides support dor a conference on the Langlands program. The objectives of the conference are (1) to bring the ideas of Langlands before a wide mathematical audience; (2) to describe recent developments in major areas of the Langlands program; (3) to attempt to anticipate future directions of work on the problems making up the Langlands' program.  The Langlands program is part of number theory. Number theory is the study of the  properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have  furnished a driving force in creating new mathematics in other  diverse parts of the discipline. The Langland's program is a  general philosophy that connects number theory with calculus;  it  embodies the modern approach to the study of whole numbers.   Modern number theory is very technical and deep, but it has had  astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer  science and coding theory.",
