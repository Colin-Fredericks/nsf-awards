 "awd_abstract_narration": "Founded in 1837, Davidson College is a private, highly selective undergraduate liberal arts college in North Carolina.  The College has a history of excellence in preparing students for careers in science, and is included in the -Oberlin Group+ as one of the 50 liberal arts colleges that contributes significantly to the training of U.S. scientists.  An average of 56 percent of the graduates in the sciences and mathematics enroll in graduate or professional schools. The Chemistry program continues to offer an excellent training environment for students interested in pursuing chemical research.  However, the major weakness in the program is the lack of adequate, safe and functional research and research training space in the Martin Science Building that houses the Department.  Although structurally sound, laboratories in the 1948 building are inadequate for current research needs and do not comply with ADA standards.  The National Science Foundation and Davidson College will form a partnership in renovating research laboratories located on the second floor of the Martin Building.  Work will include renovation, repair, or replacement of laboratory casework, fume hoods, and fixed equipment.  New finishes, lighting, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems are included for the following labs:  Organic chemistry research, Physical and Analytical research, three faculty research labs, shared instrument rooms and a prep room.  Primarily, this project will locate related disciplines together with shared support spaces, allowing greater interaction that will foster a convergence of goals for all fields of chemistry.  An exciting and safe research environment will be created, which will encourage student and faculty collaborative studies, increase the number of student scholars, and add to the future scientific infrastructure of the Nation.",
