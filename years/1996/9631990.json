 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631990  Smith    The research team investigates how domestic conditions affect international crises and how the outcome of these crises affects the domestic survival of political leaders.  More specifically, the researchers use a series of game theoretic models to answer the following question:  How does domestic politics affect foreign policy?  How do nations interact at the international level, and how do the outcomes of international events affect the domestic survival of political leaders?  The international relations literature has typically treated these relationships between internal and external politics as separate, independent questions.  In this study the investigators integrate these three questions into a single coherent model.    The investigation develops a formal model to explain how domestic politics interacts with international events.  The researchers rigorously test the predictions of the theory.  The research introduces the International Crisis Game:  A simple model that represents the conflictual incentives facing nations involved in crises.  Augmenting this game with a model of domestic politics generates predictions about the interaction of international and domestic politics.  Specifically, the model indicates how domestic conditions influence the outcome of international crises.  The model also predicts the domestic consequences of different international outcomes.    This investigation promises to substantially enhance our understanding of the topic.  ***",
