Knowledge of such morphologies is of practical importance  because it determines the microstructures of materials and,  consequently, their properties.  Results are also of  scientific interest because they shed light on the  fundamental physics of pattern formation and the solution of  free boundary problems which are at the frontier of applied  mathematics.    The research is comprised of three parts: (1) cellular  shapes and cellular dendritic shapes that occur during  directional solidification from alloy melts will be  investigated; (2) thermal fluctuations and noise will be  added to the phase field model in such a way as to insure  that the fluctuation-dissipation theory is satisfied; (3)  the phase field model will be generalized to include fluid  flow with solidification.  %%%  This is a renewal grant which will focus on improving and  applying the phase field model to obtain a quantitative  understanding of the morphologies of growing crystals and in  particular those formed by solidification from the melt.
