Dr. Martin will work with Dr.  Shigefume Okada, professor in the Faculty of Engineering, on  a research project entitled, \"Measurement of the Internal  Magnetic Fields on the FIX Experiment.\"    The proposed research will examine the various problems  involved in the development of controlled fusion as an  energy source.  The central challenge is to use magnetic  fields to confine a hot plasma long enough to produce a  sustained thermo-nuclear reaction.  One of the most  promising avenues for accomplishing this is the Field  Reversed Configuration, or FRC, a innovative device that  makes the most efficient use of its magnetic field and is  the simplest cold fusion mechanism to build and maintain. To  better understand the FRC it is important to ascertain the  internal structure of the magnetic field that confines the  hot plasma.  The research will measure this magnetic field  in the FRC Injection Experiment (FIX) at Osaka University in  Japan, using an innovative technique called Localized  Faraday Rotation (LFR).  The results of the analysis will  provide insights into theoretical and applied research  questions relating to controlled fusion as a practical,  reliable, and clean energy source for the international  community.  ***",
