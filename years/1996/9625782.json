In the past, he helped develop techniques which lead to the derivation of formulae for solutions to certain partial differential equations in terms of integrals over an appropriate path space.  He then used these formulae to obtain quite refined estimates on the solutions represented.  More recently, he has been trying to use related methods to gain insight into differential geometric problems suggested by recent physical considerations.  In particular, he hopes to learn how to construct and analyze diffusions on spaces of loops in a Riemannian manifold.    In the Newtonian picture of the world, physical objects were thought to follow definite paths, and the goal of physics was to predict the path that a particular object would follow.  In the quantum mechanical picture, physical objects are no longer thought to be so constrained.  Instead, they are thought to governed by physical laws which can, at best, predict the probability of their following a particular path.  The Newtonian and quantum picture are reconciled by the fact that, with overwhelming probability, a massive object will follow a path which is close to the one predicted by Newtonian physics.  On the other hand, when dealing with very small objects, the Newtonian prediction can be quite far off, and one can only make predictions by averaging over spaces of paths.  For this reason, it becomes important to understand how to average over paths.  The mathematical theory of averaging over various path spaces has been one of the central themes of  mathematics in this century.  Its applications are numerous and are not restricted to physics.  Indeed, over the past two decades, very sophisticated  path-space models are the basis on which commodities and financial instruments of all sorts have been priced.  Averaging over path spaces is the  central theme of the research proposed in  this project.",
