Michael Baum, Boston  University, and Raul Paredes, Anahuac University, Mexico  City.  The researchers will study comparative aspects of  brain and behavioral sexual differentiation in two mammalian  species, the rat and the ferret.  The structure and function  of the brain circuit normally undergoes a degree of  masculinization in female rats as a consequence of prenatal  exposure of the female's brain to testosterone of placental  origin.  Normally, no such masculinization occurs in the  female ferret.  Experiments are proposed to treat animals  prenatally in order to determine whether circulating  androgens and/or estrogens during fetal development are the  cause of the more masculine behavior of female rats, and to  relate differences in sexual behavior to the functional  activation of neurons within regions of the brain that have  been sexually differentiated.    All the proposed studies involving ferrets will be done in  the Boston laboratory, while the comparative work with rats  will be done in the Mexican laboratory.  The results  obtained should improve our understanding of how sex  differences in pheromonal communication  develop in species  representing two different mammalian orders, and  will  provide basic information concerning the activational and  organizational effects of steroid hormones on chemosensory  systems important for reproduction.  ***",
