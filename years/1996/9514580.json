 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maliseet-Passamaquoddy is a native American language spoken  today by more than a thousand individuals in the state of Maine  and the province of New Brunswick. In the summer of 1963  Principal Investigator Karl V. Teeter recorded 42 texts from the  oldest and most distinguished storytellers in each village. The  tapes of these texts and a preliminary transcription of about 130  pages constitute the raw material for this project         In field work beginning in the 1970s, primarily on  Passamaquoddy in Maine, Philip LeSourd arrived at a phonological  analysis which served as the basis for his M.I.T. Ph.D.  dissertation. The purpose of this project is to take advantage of  LeSourd's work and his present availability by having him edit  PI's transcriptions to bring them into accord with his own more  functional system. Two significant contributions will be made by  the project: first, it will sharply advance the study of the  Maliseet-Passamaquody language. At the same time it will provide,  in its advanced transcription specifically including accent  markings, a model for the work of the many other scholars  studying Algonquian languages.",
