 "awd_abstract_narration": "A consortium of faculty at ten colleges and universities on  Long Island, in conjunction with the State University of New  York (SUNY) system, is designing a comprehensive, multi-  faceted project to develop an environment for interconnected  learning in mathematics courses and in mathematically based  disciplines. The consortium is headquartered at the State  University of New York at Stony Brook. The other consortium  institutions are: C. W. Post College, Dowling College,  Nassau Community College, New York Institute of Technology,  St. Joseph's College, Suffolk Community College, SUNY  Agricultural and Technology College at Farmingdale, SUNY  College at Old Westbury, and CUNY-York College. The model  for interconnected learning developed on Long Island is  being extended to  SUNY-wide implementation (64  institutions), and actively disseminated to other  institutions inside and outside New York state.    The enhanced learning environment has three components: (i)  systemic change in instructional practices, (ii) creation of  new courses and curricular materials, and (iii) development  of human resources. The interconnections in this project  involve:    Collaboration and cooperation in instruction among faculty  across quantitative disciplines;  Regional interconnectivity of energized faculty at different  types of institutions; and  The enhanced effect of combining change in modes of  instruction with curricular reform, educational technology,  and coordination of instruction among departments.      Major project activities include:    * Changing modes of faculty instruction and student  learning;    * Day-to-day and general coordination of instruction across  the curriculum;    * Extensive use of educational technology across the  curriculum;    * Completing reform throughout the calculus sequence and  undertaking reform before calculus;    * Reworking all aspects of the curriculum for future  mathematics teachers to reflect the needs of the NCTM  Standards;    * Developing new multidiscipl inary courses;    * Addressing student needs in Advanced Technological  Education programs such as engineering and science  technology through the development of appropriate  mathematics courses and other mathematically oriented  materials;    * Assisting groups that are underrepresented in quantitative  disciplines;    * Developing unified courses in statistics and other  mathematical sciences topics now taught in multiple  departments.    This project for systemic change involves an extensive  organizational structure with (I) departmental teams at each  institution, (ii) institutional coordinating committees;  (iii) Consortium-wide disciplinary committees; and (iv) task  forces for specific projects such as development of new  courses.",
