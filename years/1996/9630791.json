However, thewater conducting ability of the stem  can  be  reduced when air bubbles formwithin the cells  that  normally conduct water.  These bubbles can occur  during  drought when the tension, which pulls water  through  the plant from  the  soil  to  the leaves, becomes too great and  the  water  column breaks.  Also,  during the winter, freezing of the water inside these  cells causes  air  dissolved in the water to form bubbles which can expand  and  block  water flow during periods of thaw.  We  will  be  studying the impact of the  frequency and duration of drought and winter freeze-thaws on  the water  conducting ability of stems of related Rhododendron species.  We will be  utilizing   the  natural  variation  in  winter  freeze-thaw  frequency and  intensity  of  summer  drought provided  by  two  Long  Term  Ecological Research (LTER) sites to evaluate these following  objectives:  1) determine the physical factors which control  the maximum potential water flow through these plants, 2) to  examine  possible limits to water transport in  relation  to  plant  response to climatic patterns of water  availability,  and 3) to determine the structural/physiological adaptations  of  these  species which may prevent or lessen the potential  for   the  development  of  air  blockages  in  their  water  conducting  cells.   This study will  provide  a  cross-LTER  comparison  of the ecological physiology of closely  related  taxa,  provide  information of the controls  of  water  flow  through plants, and provide information about the water  use  of understory plants to be used in models of ecosystem water  use budgeting.",
