 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current fractal tools lack the level of control necessary to  model specific natural structures.  For example, many fractal  models of trees have been constructed, but given a particular  tree, it would be difficult to represent the tree's specific  shape   using current models of fractal modeling.  The recurrent  modeling project identifies three aspects to this problem, and  attempts to solve each with several new fractal modeling tools.    Objective I:  Recurrent Model Representation.  Recurrent  modeling strives to elevate fractal representation to the level  of sophistication that smooth surfaces enjoy in computer-aided  geometric design by translating their classical self-referential  representation into standard implicit and  parametric forms.  Recurrent modeling also attempts \"procedural geometric  instancing,\" and enhancement of the classic object instancing  paradigm that enables it to more efficiently represent the  development fractal models currently specified by L-systems.    Objective II:  Interactive Recurrent Modeling.  Recurrent  modeling extends the tools of computer-aided geometric design to  fractal geometry.  A direct manipulation interface provides real  time feedback in the fractal modeling  process.  The implicit  formulation from the previous objective allows the application  of standard blending formulations specifically designed for  natural modeling.  Extending constructive solid geometry to  include fractal models supports the construction of complex  shapes from primitives.    Objective III:  Automatic Recurrent Modeling.  Recurrent  modeling attacks the inverse problem of fractal geometry:  \"find  the parameters of a fractal model that approximates a given  shape\" from the domain of model-based computer vision.  The  second PI is an NSF-supported model-based computer vision  researcher.  His unique perspective on this problem resulted in  a new solution, called \"similarity hashing\".  Similarity hashing  successfully detects self-similarity and returns the paramete rs  of the selfsimilar model in initial tests.  Recurrent modeling  continues  this research to develop an automated system for discovering  selfaffinity in natural structures.    The new tools recurrent modeling proposes would impact the  fields of computer graphics and forest science.  The new tools  would represent highly detailed geometrics, such as a forest and  crops. Such models would have applications in image synthesis,  particularly in animation, virtual environments, physically-  based modeling and remote sensing.    As the smooth representations of computer-aided geometric design  aid manufacturers, the efficient representations of detail  proposed by recurrent modeling representations would aid the  study of the environment.    ***",
