 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601499  Chowdhuri         The Center for Electric Power at the Tennessee Technological  University (TTU) all purchase (i) three 750-MHz opto-electronic  voltage probes, and three optical transmission lines, including  ancillary equipment and (ii) a 4-channel, 500-MHz digital oscilloscope with peripheral equipment.  The equipment will be used to measure very fast voltage transients for research on electromagnetic transients in power systems . This equipment will be of immediate benefit to two projects:       1.   Breakdown Mechanisms of Air Gaps under Lightning    Voltages; and       2.   Laboratory Simulation of Lightning Stroke Channel.     In addition, the proposed equipment could also be used in a third project, \"Effects of Transient Voltages on Power Semiconductor Devices\".       The ongoing projects at the Center for Electric Power  require simultaneous measurement of several very fast transient  phenomena.  The proposed equipment will make it possible to  perform these measurements without electromagnetic interferences. An understanding of the breakdown mechanisms of air gaps will result in reliable and cost effective insulation coordination of the electric power systems.  A successful laboratory simulation of the lightning stroke channel will be a powerful tool to verify theories on the response of power systems to lightning strokes, thus minimizing the need for time consuming and uncertain field tests.  ***   ??",
