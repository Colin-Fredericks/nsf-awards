 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to reform the chemistry laboratory curriculum at Sage JCA in Albany, NY by incorporating hands-on student use of microcomputers. To accomplish this goal, funding is sought for eight Power Mac computers, eight set-ups of computer interface plus probes/sensors, a variety of software packages, and cable for networking. The networked computer workstations along with existing instruments will allow for 1. an increase of student awareness of the capabilities of the microcomputer as an instrument of chemistry; 2. an enhancement of traditional teaching techniques currently used; 3. an increase in the diversity of experiments and simulations which may be performed by students; 4. an increase in student interest and understanding of the nature of measurements and of the principles of chemistry; 5. an increase in student appreciation of the role of technology in acquiring useful information; 6. an increase in student's computer literacy skills. Acquisition of the proposed equipment will impact all of the chemistry course offerings at Sage Junior College of Albany. Computer-assisted experiments and simulations are proposed to enable students to acquire, analyze and display data in a variety of different and exciting ways. These activities can help students to investigate phenomena and perform calculations rapidly and transparently to look for trends and inconsistencies in experimental data. This experience will provide students with relevant skills and improved abilities as they enter an increasingly technological world where knowledge-intensive job skills are necessary to compete for careers.",
