The KNORR will finish the WOCE Indian Ocean work in early  1996.  Two multibeam cruises will utilize the new multibeam  capability of the ship.  The Knorr will support a chemistry cruise  off the coast of Brazil before heading to the \"Rainbow Site\" off  Barbados.  The Navy will use the vessel in the Baltic and then it  will return to WHOI for an extended maintenance period .         OCEANUS will support a variety of cruises in the northeast  Atlantic and one cruise off Bermuda.  The vessel will support 211  operational days of which 75 are in support of NSF-sponsored  programs.  The remaining 136 days are in support of Navy and DOE  programs.           ATLANTIS II provides support for the Deep Submergence Vehicle  ALVIN, all 1996 AII cruises are in support of the unmanned  submersible.  The schedule begins with two cruises off the coast of  California with a 2 month stand-down period between the cruises.   The vessel will support a series of cruises off the East Pacific  Rise before transiting to the Atlantic to support cruises off the  east coast of the US and one cruise off Bermuda.         The vessels operated by WHOI are part of a fleet of ships used  by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science.   Oceanography requires highly specialized equipment that is required  to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus specialized ships.   These vessels do not operate in the same general mode as  cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of  a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic  research that are operated by universities and institutions around  the country.  ***",
