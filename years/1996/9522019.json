 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522019  Stegeman  Polymer opto-electronics has undergone rapid development in the  last five years and has shown considerable promise for photonics  applications.  However, recent papers have shown that cumulative  photodegradation of electro-optic polymers poses a serious long-  term problem.  Large changes in both the refractive index and  waveguide losses have been measured in the near infrared and  communications regions of the spectrum in the prototypical molecule  DANS.    A collaborative university-industry research team consisting of  Alex Jen of ROITECH, Seth Marder of Caltech and George Stegeman of  CREOL at the University of Central Florida will investigate these  issues under a GOALI program.  By sharing facilities and expertise,  this team will use both optical and analytical chemical techniques  to study both the major mechanisms responsible for photodegradation  and new approaches to minimizing their effects in the  communications bands.  Accelerated optical testing will simulate  device performance over many years at typical device operating  powers.    Photodegradation leads to changes in the molecular structure and  optical properties.  These changes will be measured and correlated  in well-known molecules such as DR1 and DANS.  Mechanisms such as  trans-cis isomerization, and the oxidation and breaking of bonds by  incident photons will be quantified.  Both linear and multiphoton  triggered events will be studied.  New molecules designed to reduce  photodegradation effects will be designed, synthesized and  evaluated.  For example, molecules with much narrower (than DANS or  DR1) absorption spectra placed strategically relative to the  communications bands are to be investigated.  ***",
