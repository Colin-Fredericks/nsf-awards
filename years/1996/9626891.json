This is a very recent development in what is itself a very young subject.  The participants will include investigators for Texas A & M and Washington University who are among the leaders in the area.    The basic idea in the theory of wavelets is to represent a given function - say a radar signal - as a combination of basis functions belonging to a specified set with well known analytic properties.  By choosing the correct basis functions, one hopes to get a good approximation of the given function by just a few basis functions.  In this case, the function can be described well by just a few non zero coefficients.",
