 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624486 Whites  There are a number of common, themes shared between the two major components (research and education) of this project.  Both involve electromagnetics (EM),  materials characterization and the use of computer modeling and visualization.  In summary, the research components of this project is directed at producing the first known rigorous model to accurately predict  the effective constitutive parameters (ECPs) for physically realistic composite materials and effective media.  The goals of the education component are to integrate interactive computer tools into the study of introductory EM and to integrate modern materials modeling techniques (analytical and experimental) into a senior-level course in properties of materials.    It is envisioned that this research effort will produce the first model to accurately predict the ECPs for physically realistic composite and effective materials.  Effective media predict the ECPs for physically realistic composite and effective materials. Effective media modeling impacts a broad spectrum of disciples including such diverse areas as geophysics, remote, sensing, EM shielding, planetary surface composition, electrophotography and thin-film solar filters.  The knowledge of the ECPs for composite and effective materials and their frequency dependence are absolutely critical in EM design work.  Without this knowledge, any type of EM analysis is not possible since one would be forced to model the scattering by all of the particulates which is certainly impractical.  Current  methods for macroscopic characterization are limited to simplifying assumptions such as spherical inclusions with sparse distributions in cubic arrays.   This new model will provide a numerical  environment in which scientist and engineers could fabricate, design and evaluate various mixtures of particles to form new composite materials or analyze effective media.  All of this would be done using accurate numerical analysis and would obviate the for traditional \"cut-and-dry\"  methods.  The Reason this proposed model does not have the same intrinsic limitations as all other is that a numerically \"exact\" scattering solution from the basis of the model.  The complexities inherent in a physically realistic effective materials model are all accounted for within the numerical solution.  This computationally-based effective media modeling is a new approach and would not have be feasible a few years ago because of the tremendous computational resources that will be required.  For the educational component, the first principle goal is to increase the effectiveness of introductory EM courses through the use of interactive computer visualization tools.  Because such an introductory course forms the foundation for all other EM courses, it is imperative that students develop an intuitive appreciation for the basic of this field.  As is often the case, students enter such a course with negative preconceived impressions of EM.  The use of interactive computer visualization can help students overcome some of the difficulties in such a course.  The tools to be developed in this effort are designed to help the students understand  the basic concepts in EM, rather than more advanced topics as is the case with other currently available EM  visualization tools.  It is envisioned that these tools will be directly integrated into a textbook.  The second principle educational goal is to revise and update a senior elective  properties of materials course.  This revision will encompass an integration of modern materials analysis (classical and quantum) as will as experimental methods into the course.  Many of the topics of effective media theory used in research component of this project will pertain directly to this course since, as mentioned previously, composite materials are in such wide-spread use today.  Furthermore, the introduction of experimental techniques will expose the students to modern instrumentation and will reinforce the classroom instruction. ***",
