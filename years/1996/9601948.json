 "awd_abstract_narration": "We request funds to purchase an integrated package for acoustic  data collection, modeling, and visualization. Instrument components  include two 4-frequency, digital acoustic systems for data acquisition,  a large measurement tank for instrument calibration and parameter  estimation, a portable soft, x-ray machine for organism anatomy  measurements, and a computer workstation for data management, modeling,  and visualization. When  combined, these instruments will form a Fisheries Acoustic Center with  enhanced computer power and memory; high resolution, multi-frequency  acoustic measurement and calibration facilities; and state-of-the-art  interactive acoustic modeling and visualization capabilities all housed  at a new shore-based laboratory. This instrumentation package will make  the Great  Lakes Center at Buffalo State College one of the premier institutes in  acoustic research and modeling. It will form a major research focus of  the Principal Investigators over the next 5-10 years and will be a core  instrument in academic course development and research recruitment at  the newly reconstituted Great Lakes Center at Buffalo State College.         Over the past three years, we have developed a new analytical  approach to examine the spatial ecology and production of pelagic  organisms in aquatic environments. We combine the strengths of  underwater acoustics to measure fish abundances at high spatial  resolution, bioenergetic models to measure fish consumption and growth,  and spatial modeling to define the relationship between observed  distribution patterns and causative processes. This approach has been  used to assess the effects of fine-scale changes in the spatial  pattering of biotic and abiotic habitat on the feeding ecology, growth,  and production of fishes in freshwater and estuarine environments.  Creation of a Fisheries Acoustic Center will complement ongoing  ecological research by quantifying species-specific parameters used in  foraging and spatial models.         Th e types of ongoing and projected research that will use this  equipment include the field of aquatic ecology (acoustic assessment of  the abundances, production, distributions, sizes and behavior of fishes  and invertebrates in systems ranging in size from small lakes to the  Great Lakes and oceans), acoustical oceanography (acoustic measures of  swimming speeds, target strength, and identity of acoustic scatterers)  and spatial ecology (spatial modeling in two or three dimensions of the  effects of fine-scale spatial and temporal processes on large scale  phenomena). Training will be done at the undergraduate, graduate and  postgraduate levels through a combination of individual 'on-hands'  research experience, specialized courses, visiting scientists and  remote internet access.",
