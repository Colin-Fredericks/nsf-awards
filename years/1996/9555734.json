 "awd_abstract_narration": "9555734  Frierson    The Valencia BRIDGES program (Building and Replicating an Innovative Demonstration Model to Facilitate Gender  Equity in Science) will focus on activities that increase students, faculty, and counselors understanding of  the  relationships between gender and the study of science. The project will increase the academic, retention, and  completion success rates of female community college students enrolled in science courses,  develop a new  instructional approach to better prepare females for upper division study and careers involving scientific research,  and increase the percentage of female students enrolled in science courses by helping female students make informed  career choices and better course selection decisions.  Curricular changes include a new lower division research  methods course, enriched lower division biological and physical science courses with strategies and content that are  free of gender bias, mentoring opportunities for students, hands-on internships in research laboratories at the  University of Florida, scientific and equity workshops targeted at the female student population, new recruitment  and promotion materials to targeted students, and specialized counseling and mentoring interactions which focus on  personal, transfer, career, and financial aid issues.    Community college students are less likely to have research and mentoring experiences that lead to research-based  scientific careers.  This project will reform lower level science courses to be more accessible for all students and  will partner with the state land grant institution to prepare community college students for university-level science  courses.  Mentorships will act as an informal network to increase student success.  ***",
