 "awd_abstract_narration": "Martin Feldstein  SBR-9511383    The NBER Summer Institute brings together economists from  universities, government, and international organizations for a  few days or weeks of seminars, workshops, conferences and  collaborative research.  The 1994 Summer Institute included 677  economists from 171 universities and nonacademic institutions, of  whom 58% were not affiliated with the NBER.  A similar number of  economists from a large number of institutions is expected to  attend this summer.  Special efforts were made to include younger  economists and economists not affiliated with the NBER.    The Summer Institute provides a unique opportunity for economists  to work closely with others for extended and intense periods of  research.  The Summer Institute lasts long enough to allow  serious collaboration among economists from different  institutions.  While research nearing completion is presented,  emphasis is placed on \"workshop\" aspects of the program, where  new ideas are raised, preliminary research ideas are developed,  and plans for joint or coordinated research are established.    The Summer Institute is organized into twelve programs or areas  of study, including:  economic fluctuations, economic history,  monetary economics, corporate finance, asset pricing, industrial  organization, health and aging, international studies, labor  studies, productivity and taxation.  Each program has its own  group of participants and its own group structure.  Although  there is considerable variations among the programs, a typical  program will last from one to three weeks, with time allowed  during the day for research.  Programs may include a variety of  subjects or they may be organized around specific topics.",
