Extensive numerical tests are performed to  evaluate the effectness of the proposed recovery techniques for  the Poisson equation, the nearly incompressible elasticity  equation, the Reissner-Mindlin plate model, and the Stokes  equation for different finite element bases.  The computational  experimentation consider various mesh geometries and some domains  with reentrant corners, such as the L-shaped domain and the  cracked domain.  The primary objective of this project is the study of  derivative superconvergence and its recovery in finite element  computations.  Such study is of fundamental importance in  computational mechanics, because engineers are interested in more  effective ways to estimate the stress, strain energy, etc.  At  present, most of the commercial codes used by the engineering  community are required to have adaptive capabilities, which allow  computations to be carried out in the most efficient way.  A  knowledge of superconvergence is essential for this adaptivity  design through a posteriori error estimates.  This project  provides a firm theoretical basis for developing reliable and  computationally inexpensive superconvergent recovery techniques.  The results of this research affect large-scale scientific  computing on problems of practical interest arising in structural  me chanics.",
