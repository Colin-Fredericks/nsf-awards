 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of our project is to develop an interactive  computer graphics system to be used in upper-level optics  courses taught in physics departments and various  engineering departments.Currently physics and engineering  students learn about optics from textbooks which illustrate  the basic principles by means of two-dimensional black and  white drawings, and from lectures in which figures are drawn  on the board or presented on overhead projectors. These  traditional methods for communication are less than ideal  for imparting a comprehensive and intuitive understanding of  many optical phenomena. What is needed is a system in which  the user (be it the professor lecturing or students working  on their own) can call up the phenomenon of interest, enter  the parameter values they are interested in, and then watch  a three-dimensional, animated visualization of the  phenomena. The goal of our project is to develop such a  system, and we have already made significant progress  towards it. Our system, which we call The Optics Project  (TOP), is written in the C programming language, and it uses  the OpenGl and Motif libraries for, respectively, the  graphics and the user interface. When completed, TOP will  contain eight modules which address eight topics typically  covered in a junior/senior optics course and two additional  modules which cover important topics which are usually  omitted in a one-semester course due to lack of time. Each  module will contain several options which investigate  different phenomena. TOP will have a system of \"help\"  screens to aid the user run the visualizations and give  him/her information on the phenomenon being studied. These  help screens will be similar to Mosaic and/or Netscape in  that they will be written in HTML and contain hypertext  links. Our project will have an advisory board of six optics  and computer graphics experts who will look at the modules  and give us suggestions. Physics departments from seven  universities in the Southeast have agreed  to look at TOP and  consider it for use in their optics courses.",
