 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will design, implement, evaluate, and disseminate a  unique model program for:  (a) presenting science activities that  will interest and challenge elementary school girls in  extracurricular settings while providing them with role models; and  (b) helping female undergraduate and graduate students improve  their scientific/technical expertise and self esteem by giving a  worthwhile outlet for their technical knowledge.  The project is  co-sponsored by the University of Iowa Women in Science and  Engineering (WISE) Program and the Association of Women in Science-  Eastern Iowa Chapter, with the cooperation of the Iowa City  Community School District, and the Iowa City Area Sciences Center,  Inc.     Three teams, each with one female faculty, staff, or post-doctoral  scientist or engineering, one female representative from the  science center,and 4-6 female undergraduate and graduate students,  will design science curriculum packets.  Science teachers will  serve as educational consultants.  Each curriculum packet will  include and integrated set of gender-equitable science activities  developed around a different multi-disciplinary theme.  The science  themes will complement, not duplicate, the classroom curriculum.   Activities in each curriculum packet will include:  (a) short,  exploratory activities that can be completed in 15 minutes or less;  (b) longer activities that require at least 30 to 60 minutes to  complete; and (c) extension activities that can be completed by  students at home with or without parental involvement.  Activities  will use gender-free language, require hands-on experience in small  groups, develop research skills, relate to daily life, be non-  competitive, and support more than one correct outcome.  Such  activities are appropriate for use with both girls and boys, are  more effective for girls than traditional science curricula.  The  science curriculum packets will include:  (a) edible chemistry (for  grades K-1), (b) brain power (for grades 2-3), and  (c) genetics  (grade 4-6).    Each team will present these activities to elementary school-aged  girls and boys in extra-curricular settings (e.g., before and after  school day care programs; neighborhood centers that serve low-  income families; elementary school science clubs; clubs such as  Girls Scouts, Campfire,and 4-H; and community science programs) in  Iowa City and surrounding school districts.  The design teams will  evaluate the effectiveness of each activity and make appropriate  modifications.  The program will benefit three groups:  (a)  elementary school girls (and boys), (b) female college students,  and (c) female professional scientists and engineers.  The program  will increase the awareness of parents and educators of gender  issues in SEM; place science education in a community context;  extend the scientific and technical resources of the university  into the community; and increase the visibility of female  scientists and engineers.",
