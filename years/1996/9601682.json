 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stimulus-induced  alteration  in  the   concentration   of  intracellular second messengers is a key mechanism by which  cell  function  can  be regulated. With the development of  fluorescent  probes,  it  became possible to directly measure changes  in  the  concentration  of a number of second messengers such  as  calcium  and  hydrogen  ions in both resting and stimulated  cells.  Until  recently,   fluorometric  measurements  of   intracellular   ions  monitored   generalized  changes,  but  were   not   sufficiently  sensitive  nor had adequate temporal resolution to  measure  very  brief, localized ion release from internal stores. However,  with  laser scanning confocal microscopy, it now is possible to measure  elevations in intracellular ions or pH changes within micron-thin  optical  sections through living cells. For example,  the  brief,  localized  elevation of intracellular calcium, that results  from  the   opening   of   calcium   channels   in   the   sarcoplasmic  reticulum/endoplasmic  reticulum  can  be  measured  as  \"calcium  sparks\"  (3,8).  These  local  calcium  sparks  have  a  profound  influence  on  muscle  function by  summing  to  cause  a  global  elevation  of  intracellular calcium leading  to  contraction  in  heart  muscle (3) or by activating surface membrane  K+  channels  leading  to  vasodilitation in smooth muscles (8). Calcium  spark  activity,  in  turn, is intimately controlled  by  local  calcium  entry  through  surface  membrane channels.  These  extraordinary  insights into fundamental mechanisms of cardiac muscle and smooth  muscle  control were permitted by the unparalleled resolution  of  the  laser-scanning  confocal  microscope  (3,8).  This  approach  permits  one  to  follow the fate of key ions, such  as  calcium,  which after crossing the cell membrane are then sequestered  into  internal stores. Although calcium sparks occur as random  events,  their  frequency and kinetic properties commonly are affected  by  cell  voltage.  Cons equently, the local changes in  intracellular  calcium,  monitored as calcium sparks, must be measured in  cells  with  membrane  voltage  controlled. It is  proposed  that  these  fluorescence  measurements will be made on cells voltage  clamped  with  whole cell patch clamp techniques. Also, these measurements  will  be made under conditions which allow for rapid exchange  of  bathing solutions.        A  Major  objective  of  five of the  six  projects  is  to  establish the relationships between calcium entry through surface  membrane  calcium channels and activation of calcium  sparks  and  then subsequent effects on membrane ionic conductances in neurons  and   in   different  smooth  muscle  cells.  The  last   project  investigates  the  role  that  intracellular  pH  plays,  in  the  regulation  of  chemotaxis  in  Paramecium,  by  measuring  local  intracellular changes in proton concentration. Each project  asks  a  very  specific question concerning the role of  brief,  highly  localized  changes in calcium or pH which may be  critical  to  a  specific  cell  function. Further, the requested  equipment  will  permit  the  investigation  of other key  issues  such  as  local  homeostatic  regulation of intracellular ionic concentrations  by  extrusion  mechanisms. The critical requirement  of  all  of  the  proposed  studies  is the ability to measure very  rapid,  highly  localized  changes  in the concentration  of  calcium  or  pH  in  voltage-clamped cells.        Funds   are  requested  to  create  a  multiuser   facility  comprised of three closely integrated components: a Noran Odyssey  XL  digital  confocal  laser scanning  imaging  system,  a  Nikon  Diaphot  200  inverted  microscope and an Axon  Instrument  based  voltage  clamp  system. The presence of this highly sophisticated  instrumentation will greatly enhance the research capabilities of  the  project  directors  and also will  provide  significant  new  training  opportunities  for  our  current  and  future  gradua te  students and postdoctoral fellows.",
