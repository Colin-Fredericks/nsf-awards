 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627043  Anderson    The Cincinnati Museum of Natural History and Science (CMNHS) is producing a large format film on caves.  The film will be a multidisciplinary introduction to the little-understood world of caves and cave science.  Caves will introduce viewers to the alien beauty and wonder of caves and the scientists and explorers who study them.  It will explore the formation of caves and speleothems, the highly adapted life-forms found in caves and the varied use of caves by people, past and present.  A comprehensive educational package of ancillary materials will be available to schools and to the general audience.      The PI for the project will be Kit Anderson, Director of Film Projects for CMNHS.  The principal science content specialist will be Jacqueline Janine Belwood, a researcher in vertebrate zoology at CMNHS.  She will work closely with an advisory committee of eighteen experts in caves, in the various science disciplines relevant to the cave environment, and in large format films.  She also will have access to the expertise found among the staff of the CMNHS.  The film will be produced by MacGillivray Freeman Films, the company that produced the large format film, \"To Fly\".",
