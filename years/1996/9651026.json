 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many science and engineering students take a course on modern physics without taking the modern physics laboratory. This exposition to the experimental foundations of modern physics is far from adequate. To correct this problem, we propose to add an interactive component to the modern physics class: a set of computer exercises designed to simulate key modern physics experiments.  Simulated experiments in quantization (e.g., photoelectric effect), scattering (e.g., Rutherford), and quantum mechanics (e.g., Stern-Gerlach) will be designed and developed at UTEP. The simulations will give students direct control of input variables, access to output data and to analysis tools for a rapid study of the results. A manual will be written to accompany the software.  The use of the simulations will be tested at UTEP and New Mexico State University. The modules will be later implemented in UTEP's modern physics course. Assessment and evaluation of the simulations will be done at the student and faculty level and by a consultant.  Physics departments serving science and engineering colleges will benefit from the product of this proposal. For greater compatibility, the simulations will be developed for MacIntosh and PC systems. In particular, community colleges and institutions with small laboratory facilities will find the simulations useful. Implementing the teaching tools at UTEP will greatly benefit minority students.",
