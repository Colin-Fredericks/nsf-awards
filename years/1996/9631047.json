 "awd_abstract_narration": "A team of collaborators from seven bioinformatics research  organizations proposes to enhance existing software tools to  create a World Wide Web (WWW) based expert taxonomic resource  that will be immediately valuable for the international virology  community and will serve as a prototype for taxonomic data  resources in other biological disciplines. Expanding on  previously funded NSF project, the team will complete development  of the software infrastructure for providing real time access to  the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses' database  (ICTVdB). This taxonomic knowledge base will combine the  advantages of local, warehoused datafiles with the ability to  establish dynamic links to distributed forms of data and will  provide for immediate updating of the files. Enhancement and  modification of the DELTA suite of programs, used for taxonomic  research and biodiversity studies, will permit data analysis and  identification of organisms via the WWW. Linking of ICTV data  with other biological datasets, e.g., genomic data, graphics,  repository, and reference data via HTML and the web will enable  taxonomic comparisons based on genetic and phenotypic data  analysis. Use of the Web/Genera and Sybase software to enable SQL  queries and online data entry/updates over the Internet to a  relational database interoperating with DELTA will give  taxonomists and other researchers multiple access points and data  management capabilities, depending on their specific  requirements. The proposed data resource will conform to  prescribed standards in data modeling, syntax and semantics, thus  facilitating membership in the emerging \"federation\" of  biological database developers. It will also serve as a utility  to enhance modeling of complex biological systems.",
