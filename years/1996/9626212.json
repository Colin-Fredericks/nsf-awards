I shall be waiting for any  comments, suggestions, etc. On my portion, I was somewhat general, instead of  specifically indicating that in particular, I am interested in the  determinacy strength of mice with so many measurables above some fixed  number of Woodin cardinals. I guess this is fine, being general, and  better satisfies the purpose of the abstract??        Thanks in advance for any comments,           Derrick    ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                DMS-9626212  Derrick DuBose/Douglas Burke      Douglas Burke and Derrick DuBose are involved in this project.  The  research of Douglas Burke is primarily concerned with generic embeddings  in set theory.  These embeddings have been instrumental in using new  axioms (large cardinals) to prove statements that are undecidable in the  usual, basic axioms of set theory.  In particular, they have many  applications in descriptive set theory and combinatorial set theory. Burke  has two long term goals in his research program: (i) to apply large  cardinals and generic embeddings to combinatorial questions (and apply  combinatorial results to questions about generic embeddings), and (ii) to  extend the connection between large cardinals and definable well-orderings  of the real numbers to larger classes of definable sets. Derrick DuBose  has been engaged in establishing correspondences between inner models  closed under sharp functions and the determinacy of classe s near the  bottom of the analytic hierarchy.  He intends to establish similar  correspondences involving classes higher up in the analytic hierarchy.  He  will also continue to investigate moderate determinacy assumptions and the  determinacy strength of small \"mice\" and of mild large cardinal properties.    During the last fifty years, many natural mathematical questions have been  shown to be independent of the usual axioms of set theory.  In order to  decide such questions, new axioms have been introduced.  Of particular  importance are Large Cardinal Axioms and Determinacy Hypotheses. The Large  Cardinal Axioms are axioms of infinity, whereas determinacy hypotheses  state that certain definable infinite games have winning strategies.  Surprisingly, a strong connection exists between these two groups of  axioms. Also both are important in that they decide many properties about  sets of real numbers and other ``small'' sets.",
