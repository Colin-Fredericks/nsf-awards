In the first front, effort will be made  to understand the propagation of interfaces, the shape of energy minimizers  and the dynamics of typical solutions. In the second front, of main concern  are the existence and locations of concentration of solutions as a physical  parameter becomes small. In the third front, the effects of various biological  and physical parameters on the solutions of the systems will be studied.  %%%    The convolution models arise in the mathematical studies of grain boundaries   in crystalline solids, binary alloys as well as in the study of  excitation in neural networks. The equations in the second front are  nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations of mathematical physics and one arising in   the study of chemotaxis of cells. The chemotaxis  systems considered in the third front model the oriented motion of cells in  response to the concentration gradient of chemicals in the environment,   and the research done and proposed here aims at understanding how   the motility and the sensitivity of cells to the chemical affect    the size of the population of cells as well as the way in which  cells are   distributed in the long run.  The proposed research in all  the three parts will help reveal and understand the important phenomena  such as phase seperations, concentration and blow-up in the related  fields of material sciences, biophysics and quantum mechanics.  ***",
