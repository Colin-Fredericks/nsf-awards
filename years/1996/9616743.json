 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project support a China-US Bilateral Workshop on Seismic Codes to be held in China in December of 1996.  Approximately ten participants from the United States will attend, and their international travel costs are to be paid from the NSF grant for this project. The costs of the Workshop incurred within China, including lodging, meals, and local travel, are to be paid on the part of China, who are represented by two agencies: The Institute of Engineering Mechanics of the State Seismological Bureau and the Institute of Earthquake Engineering of the Academy of Building Research.    The subject of the Workshop extends to a future generation of seismic codes, rather than merely a comparison of existing seismic codes in China and the United States.  The American participants will be selected by a three-member Steering Committee, in consultation with the NSF project officer.  Participants will write papers to be included in a Proceedings of the Workshop.  A bilateral working group will develop recommendations for plenary session discussion at the Workshop, and the recommendations adopted will also be included in the Proceedings.  It is planned that selected key participants from other key countries will attend, as coordinated by the American and Chinese organizers; costs associated with those participants and arrangements for any papers they may write are beyond the scope of this proposal.  This is a project implemented under the US-China Protocol on Cooperative Earthquake Studies, Annex III.",
