People can often determine, by  drawing a finger across a surface, whether it is cloth,  styrofoam, leather etc.; it is not known, however, on what  specific aspects of the stimulus event these perceptions are  based.  The hypothesis to be explored in this research is that  small vibrations, set up in the skin when the finger moves across  a textured surface, contain the information needed to make many  of these judgments, and that sensory processing of the vibrations  in fact contributes to texture perception.  The research will  test this notion in a number of ways.  First, the vibrations  themselves will be recorded and analyzed.  The information they  contain will be evaluated and compared with the performance of  experimental participants.  Second, higher-order features of the  vibration, such as the way it waxes and wanes over time, will be  manipulated to determine if perception reflects the encoding of  such temporal patterns.  Third, some textures will be presented  repeatedly, to learn how adaptation influences the precision of  texture judgments; the resulting perceptual changes will yield  information about underlying sensory processes.  Fourth, textures  will be touched indirectly, with a small rod, thus eliminating  all cues except vibration.  If subjects' judgments are still  accurate, the importance of vibration in texture perception will  be established.  Fifth, pre-recorded vibrations will be played  back to the finger, to determine whether participants can  recognize the original texture.  These five sets of experiments  will provide a thorough test of the hypothesis that vibrations  contribute to tactile texture perception, an idea that has  important implications for remote and prosthetic sensing, and for  the possibility of sensory enhancement in persons with  somesthetic impairments.  In additi on, the research will  contribute basic knowledge about an important aspect of tactile  perception.    ***",
