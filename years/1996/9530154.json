These institutions have the   common goal of studying the interactions between the sea surface   temperatures (SST) of the Pacific and Caribbean and the overlying trade   convergence regime of the troposphere and the resulting anomalous   excursions and intensity fluctuations of rain-producing processes.  The   ultimate goal is to study the detail of these processes, to examine the   relationships to the details of climate anomalies in the region and to   develop useful ways of forecasting the resulting climate fluctuations.  The   forecast activities will take into account the potential social and   economic impacts on human activities within the region so that the relevant   aspects of the climate can de identified and strongly targeted for   research.   The workshop will enable the core group of institutions in Colombia, Costa   Rica, Ecuador, Panama, and the United States to reach out to the other   institutions of the region to inform them of the goals of the project,   understand their needs and priorities, and coordinate with them to jointly   plan for the implementation of research and ultimately of useful forecasts.   This proposal assembles a diverse team of investigators from both academic   and governmental institutions in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, and   the United States.  These countries are Member States of the IAI, an   initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global change issues among   the scientific institutions of the Americas.  The National Science   Foundation is the designated U.S. Government agency to carry out the U.S.   responsibilities within the IAI.
