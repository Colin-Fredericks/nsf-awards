 "awd_abstract_narration": "This institution is acquiring computers, interfaces, appropriate sensors, and support equipment for three chemistry laboratories that make possible the introduction of microcomputer-based laboratories into the general chemistry program. Approximately 700 students take general chemistry each year. The acquisition of this equipment enables students to collect, display, and analyze data rapidly such that students can investigate graphical relationships, discover mathematical relationships, handle statistical analyses, and design new experiments in an effort to enhance critical thinking capability. An emphasis is being placed on the investigation and interpretation of graphical patterns and mathematical relationships within the general chemistry laboratory program. The project provides for the development of new experiments dealing with gas laws, spectrophotometry, thermochemistry, and electrochemistry that utilize the newly acquired computer systems. In addition, all general chemistry students work in teams to design a team experiment using the new equipment. This is the project's culminating activity in the general chemistry laboratory program.",
