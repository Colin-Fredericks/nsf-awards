 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Scientific Committee on Oceanic  Research (SCOR) in order to assist qualified ocean scientists from  developing countries attend various planning workshops and  international scientific meetings that are sanctioned by SCOR and  of interest to the National Science Foundation.  This ongoing  project has become the corner stone of SCOR's efforts to provide  assistance to marine scientists in the third world and, more  recently in Russia and Eastern Europe.  All recipients of funds are  informed that this assistance is made possible through a grant to  SCOR from the US National Science Foundation.  The NSF funds are  used to broaden international involvement in these activities in  the preliminary phases; once the value of an individual's  participation is demonstrated, he or she will be invited to join  the relevant group and will then be supported from the basic SCOR  budget.  Project objectives include: broadening traditional  participation in ocean-related international scientific meetings to  include more scientists from developing countries; enhancing the  exchange of detailed regional knowledge or expertise in planning  for large-scale oceanographic experiments; and providing greater  opportunities leading to the involvement of developing countries in  international collaborative programs, such as JGOFS and GLOBEC.",
