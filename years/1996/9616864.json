 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616864  Jaeger  This award provides support for innovative approaches to  improving the educational experience of students attending  the 1997 IEEE/EMBS (Engineering in Medicine and Biology  Society) conference (Chicago, Illinois, October 30-November  2, 1997), and to encourage students to participate more  fully in professional societies after graduation.  The  innovations will be applied to the Pre-Conference Workshops  and three Special Student Mini-Symposia.  It is hoped that  this technique will serve as a model for other professional  societies seeking to increase student involvement in their  proceedings.    In past conferences there has been poor attendance by  students at the Pre-Conference Workshops, primarily due to  the additional registration costs.  Funds from this award  would be used to support 80% of the registration fees for 50  students, who would pay 20% of the fee.  The criteria by  which the applications are to be judged are:  evidence of  the student's commitment to engineering and medicine, the  extent that the student is involved in a research project  related to the workshop requested, evidence that the student  will take a position in a company and will work in an area  related to the workshop requested, and evidence that the  student's academic program of study would be complemented by  attending the workshop requested.    Mini-Symposia in past EMBS meetings have largely been  tutorials on topics of general interest to practicing  biomedical engineers.  This award provides support for three  Mini-Symposia specifically directed to the needs of students  who are about to move to the workplace from a formal  educational experience.    The effectiveness of the innovations is to be documented by  the PI from the preparation of a statistical summary of  student participation and an analysis of the evaluation  questionnaires to be completed by the student participants.  ***",
