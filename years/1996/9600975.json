 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600975  Thorsness   This research project is focused on understanding the integration of mitochondrial and cellular metabolism, specifically the turnover of mitochondrial compartments.  In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mitochondrial compartments that are damaged or in excess of what is required for optimum cellular metabolism are specifically taken up and degraded by the vacuole.  In order to further investigate this process, a novel assay that monitors autophagy of mitochondria by vacuoles has been developed.  A yeast strain has been constructed in which the only alkaline phosphatase activity in the cell is localized in the mitochondrial compartment.  This alkaline phosphatase is inactive unless it is activated by a specific proteolytic event that occurs only in the vacuole.  Thus, changes in growth conditions, mutations, or damage by chemicals that alter the rate of autophagy of mitochondrial compartments by vacuoles can be easily monitored by assaying alkaline phosphatase activity.  A specific goal of this project is to define physiologically relevant events that change the rate of turnover of mitochondrial compartments.  The autophagy assay will be used to investigate the catabolite inactivation of mitochondrial activities occurring in yeast upon changes in culture conditions.  A second goal is to investigate the stability of mitochondrial compartments with respect to vacuolar function upon the inducement of damage to mitochondria by chemicals and drugs that inhibit mitochondrial activities.  Finally, a plate assay for mitochondrial autophagy will be developed with the long range goal of using that assay for the identification of vacuolar and mitochondrial gene products that are required for the turnover of mitochondrial compartments.  %%%   In addition to being an important site of cellular energy production, mitochondria are also the site of many essential biosynthetic operations.  Thus, mitochondria are essential components of all eucaryotic cells.  Under some circumstances, mitoch ondrial compartments can be damaged by environmental toxins or be present in excess and consequently need to be destroyed by the vacuole, a site of degradation in the cell.  This research project is designed to identify what types of damage lead to destruction of mitochondrial compartments and what metabolic conditions result in excess mitochondria that are subsequently destroyed.  Additionally, the components of mitochondria and vacuoles that are necessary for this destruction will be identified.  ***",
