 "awd_abstract_narration": "9555832  Nair  This project proposes to complete a manuscript of a \"Field Guide to  Women in Science and Engineering.\"  These \"Voices from the Field\"  are personal stories of women scientists and engineers aimed at a  large and diverse audience of middle school and high school girls,  through undergraduate and graduate students, and professional  women.  The book is based on interviews--conducted by telephone or  in person--with these women.  In choosing the scientists and  engineers to be interviewed, we have tried to include a spectrum of  women with respect to ethnic heritage as well as types of career  path and achievement.  We believe that this book can provide a  unique resource for girls and women by conveying the real and  diverse pathways to and experiences in a career in science or  engineering.  The Sloan Foundation funded the first year of this  effort.    Attachment 1 includes six of the profiles completed.  Each profile  charts the woman's life as related by her, narrating personal and  professional aspirations, difficulties, milestones, and  achievements.  In addition, several of them draw lessons from her  life to guide young women who wish to work in science and  engineering.  ***",
