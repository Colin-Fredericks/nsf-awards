 "awd_abstract_narration": "9560452  Ebert   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the current lack of integrated techniques and methods by which rock art data can be completely and accurately recorded three-dimensionally, managed within a three-dimensional database, and analyzed with respect not only to formal features of individual rock art elements, but also to interrelationships among figures, the rock on which they are placed, and associated sites, places, and views.  The research investigates the feasibility of developing an integrated system for rock art data recording, management, and analysis incorporating infield three-dimensional digitizing, the use of electronic distance measurement (EDM) and global positioning systems (GPS) for control and site mapping, computer-assisted drawing (CAD) and geographic information systems (GIS) technologies for data input and database management, and computerized photogrammetry and such additional technical adjuncts as analog and digital photography, all linked by specially designed software and methods.  Research objectives include an exhaustive survey of current data user needs as well as an assessment of new data possibilities and theoretical directions that such a system would provide.  The appropriateness and feasibility of integrating both off-the-shelf and modified technologies, including hardware and software, will also be investigated.  Finally, the nature of software specifically designed to link systems components, as well as methods by which these will all be used as a consolidated system, will be examined.  Systems components and integrative software and methods will be preliminarily tested in rock art data field situations.   Rock art researchers, cultural resource managers, Native American groups, anthropologists, art historians, and other rock art and rock art data users-- in the United States and worldwide--will benefit from the development of such methods.  An additional, related field of study and social concern, graffiti studies an d control, offers another potential market.",
