 "awd_abstract_narration": "This university's innovative engineering design thread, which begins with a freshman design project and culminates with an interdisciplinary senior capstone design project of some significance, is one of the stronger such design sequences. Unfortunately, the capabilities of the laboratories have not been sufficient to properly support the program. As part of a comprehensive curriculum upgrade opportunity, this project further strengthens the curriculum's strongest component.   All freshmen are being introduced to virtual instruments and to measurements concepts, an idea not achievable with discrete instruments. All sophomores take a broad sophomore instrumentation laboratory based on the same software with extended hardware capabilities. Statistical analysis of data, sampling for quality control, transient capture, frequency domain analysis, and filtering of data are all components of this laboratory. The broad coverage of instrumentation concepts is made possible by the participation of faculty from all engineering departments. Finally, junior and senior laboratories gain similar data acquisition and processing capability, which students should already know how to use, and students in (required) senior capstone design projects are given access to the automated data acquisition hardware and software which they have been using for 4 years. The 4-year design sequence, which terminates in an interdisciplinary senior capstone design project, is already out in front of the ABET 2000 proposed design criterion. With the new laboratory support, it could well serve as a model program for the new team-based, interdisciplinary, 4-year design experience being proposed by ABET. The participating faculty can perform longitudinal evaluation of the project.",
