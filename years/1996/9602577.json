 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ranomafana Biological Station is located in Ranomafana  National Park(RNP) in southeast Madagascar. The station is  operated by the Institute for the Conservation of Tropical  Environrnents (ICTE)affiliated with the State University of  New York and Stony Brook. The station property has been  leased to ICTE and the University of Antananarivo for 99  years by the Association Nationale pour la Gestiondes Aires  Protegees (ANGAP), the park service of Madagascar. Over one  hundred faculty-level researchers and nearly twice that  nurnber of students, most from US universities, have  conducted research at RNPsince the station was built in  1989.    Madagascar is a megadiversity country, one of the five  countries in the world that contain the most species of  plants and animals. Ranomafana National Park is one of the  highest biodiversity sites in Madaga'scar. The Ranomafana  Biological Station (RBS) is the only major biological  research station in the rain forest of  sites Madagascar.  Much of the flora and fauna of Madagascar is endemic and  many taxa are living representatives of lineages usually  existing elsewhere on earth only in the fossil record.  Therefore the rain forest at RNP serves as an excellent  comparison to some of the better-studied rain forest sites  in the neotropics, Africa and Asia.    The Ranomafana National Park protects 41,500 ha of rain  forest, half of it pristine. The biodiversity of the park  was virtually unknown when researchers started focussing on  the area 10 years ago.  Much of the research effort during  the first 10 years at the RBS has been devoted to the  essential work of systematists. However, considerable  research has also been conducted on behavioral ecology of  mamrnals and birds and important community dynamics such as  seed-dispersal, pollination, predation and phenology.    This large body of information has been collected at a  biological station that has neither electricity nor running  water. Most of these data come from observation-based fi eld  research because processing and analysis of sarnples and  data are severely restricted by the primitive laboratory  facilities.  This project will allow the RBS leardership to  carry out the comprehensive planning necessary to upgrade  the laboratory and living  facilities at the RBS. The  results of this planning grant will be a report that details  how best to expand the research  facilities to accomrnodate  long-term researchers using technically-oriented  methods  that take advantage of existing and  developing research  technology.  Aquatic ecologists, systematists, behavioral  ecologists, community ecologists, and  conservation  biologists will participate in planning the biological  station upgrade so that they can improve the quality and  quantity of data they collect.",
