 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619792  Cai       The investigator studies the numerical solution of partial  differential equations (including convection-diffusion,  Helmholtz, incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes, and  elasticity equations) by a least-squares formulation for an  equivalent first-order system.  First-Order System Least Squares  (FOSLS) formulates the original problem as an equivalent  minimization problem by applying a least-squares principle to an  equivalent first-order system.  Hence, it represents a general  methodology that can produce a variety of algorithms, depending  on such choices as the first-order system and the least-squares  norm, and that can lead to formulations that have substantially  different numerical properties (accuracy, adaptivity, and  complexity).  The project seeks a proper first-order system and a  proper least-squares norm for formulating the original problem so  well that the numerical process (discretization and multigrid  solution) becomes straightforward and optimal.  Certain finite  element methods for FOSLS minimization problems for second-order  elliptic and incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations  are of optimal accuracy in each variable (including new  variables).  Standard multigrid methods applied to the resulting  discrete equations have optimal complexity (i.e., computational  cost for full multigrid solution is proportional to the number of  unknowns.).  This project continues efforts on problems with  discontinuous coefficients, high Reynolds number flows, and  linear elasticity with general boundary conditions.       This project aims to develop a new computational method for  systems of parial differential equations that model the physical  phenomena of fluid flow.  The approach modifies existing  mathematical formulations for these processes, and leads to more  efficient and robust computational techniques than those  currently in use.  These new algorithms enable computer  simulations of a large class of problems in science and  engineering and mi nimize the need for costly experimental  measurements.",
