The objectives of  The Well-Connected Educator include creating an arena for educators to publish; disseminating lessons learned; providing a forum for discussion of educational technology issues; encouraging reflective practice and collaboration, and promoting thinking among teachers, administrators, and others in the education community about education reform and the impact of technology on reform.   It will give a voice to those who are most directly concerned with implementing educational technology and give their peers valuable, first-hand information about using technology for teaching and learning. All articles will be archived and searchable on a variety of categories.   Ultimately, the goal is to create an environment of trust for educators to publish and read each others' works in order to learn from one another. If this environment is sustained over a period of  years, it may help to change the culture of teaching to one that includes respect for educators as professionals, self respect, and the knowledge that teachers have valuable information and should publish it. In addition, it can serve as a vehicle for  a cadre of teacher-leaders to emerge, giving them a national voice while it encourages them to remain in the classroom. In addition, it can help the various groups to understand one another's perspectives; such understanding is key to education reform.  ***",
