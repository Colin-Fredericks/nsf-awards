 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study proposes to apply advanced engineering methods to study primate hip function. The  primate hip joint is a complex structure that serves a wide range of purposes. A better  understanding of this structure will not only facilitate our knowledge of hip joint function but  also provide important evidence about the evolutionary process of early human locomotion.   This is because the hip joint underwent substantial reorganization in the transition to a bipedal  form of locomotion.  Despite extensive research efforts devoted to this structure in the last two  centuries, hip functions remain poorly understood.  Up until now, most work has been confined  to the documentation of the shape of the hip skeleton and little effort has been invested to  analyze the functional implications of observed morphological traits.  This project will take a comprehensive approach that has only recently become possible. It will  for the first time systematically incorporate external hip morphology, internal trabecular bone  density patterns, and functional loads into global femoral and acetabular models. It will examine  the relationship between form and function in the hip of humans as well as various other large  bodied primates.  The objectives of this study are:  (1) To quantify bone density patterns in behaviorally diverse monkeys, apes, and humans.  (2) To test predictions concerning the biomechanical significance of isolated joint features.   (3) To integrate external morphological features, internal architecture and joint loads into a  single global model so that the relative sensitivity of single variables and sets of variables to  joint forces and muscle forces can be investigated.    (4) To use those variables which are found to be sound indicators of loading to reconstruct  positional behavior in fossil species.    This project will make substantial contributions in the following fields:  (1) Comparative Functional Morphology: This study will contribute new information to the field  of comparative anatomy by integrating data on joint surface geometry, trabecular bone density  and mechanical loading.  (2) Paleoanthropology: This study will extend our current understanding of form/function  relationships in the hip of living primates and provide paleontologists with new tools to  reconstruct positional behavior in extinct species.   (3) Methodological Contribution: The integration of modern bone remodeling theories with  computer and bioengineering technologies is a new approach in biological anthropology and will  help to establish new research frontiers.",
