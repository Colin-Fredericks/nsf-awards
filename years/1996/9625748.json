 "awd_abstract_narration": "Design, dimensioning and control of high-speed telecommunication networks requires a thorough understanding of traffic characteristics of various types of communication services and the ability to use these characteristics for performance assessment.  Teletraffic modeling techniques existing in the literature either lead to very large-scale structured Markov chain solution problems for which available algorithmic approaches suffer from huge CPU time requirements, or to models for which, at this time, there are no pratically analytical results for queuing analysis.  The PIs do teletraffic modeling consisting of simple, general and systematic algorithms to model building based on D-BMAP's (discrete-time Batch Markovian Arrival Process).  The modeling process is desired to capture the first and second order statistics of the original traffic streams that are known to play the dominant role in teletraffic performance. Moreover, the PIs propose parallel algorithms for modeling as an alternative to techniques based on serial procedures for large-scale nonlinear optimization problems.  Such traffic models when fed into single server queues can be analyzed by the paradigm of M/G/1 or G/M/1 type Markov chains.  They propose to use matrix sign function based algorithms for the associated invariant subspace computation .   These algorithms have high convergence rates (unlike the linear convergence rates of existing algorithms), they are amenable to parallelization and, therefore, it is now possible to efficiently analyze moderately sized M/G/1 and G/M/1 type Markov chains.",
