Human adults can use distance and direction  information to code location, both with respect to the self and  with respect to external landmarks.  Their spatial coding is  hierarchical, i.e., existing at various nested levels of  resolution.  In addition, they can use symbolic spatial  representations, most notably maps.    This research will advance our understanding of how these aspects  of spatial competence develop in human infancy and childhood.  Previous studies have already shown that, by 16 months, children  show hierarchical metric coding of spatial location, but that, at  about 21 months, there is an abrupt increase in the use of  external landmarks distant from the viewer in such coding, and  that, over middle childhood, there are changes in the nature of  the categories used in higher-level coding.    Studies with infants will determine whether metric coding is  present early in life, and if so, what referents are used in such  coding, and what the resolution of the system is.  Studies with  toddlers will define whether the developmental changes in the use  of distal landmarks are due to hippocampal maturation or to  growing control of upright walking, and whether children of this  age can remember the location of particular objects in particular  locations when more than one is hidden at a time.  Studies with  school-age children will determine whether developmental changes  in the nature of categories used in hierarchical coding underlie  real-world changes in accuracy of spatial localization.  Other  studies with preschool and school-aged children will delineate  how children use distance and direction information in map   representations.    Overall, this research program will develop further a model of  the emergence of spatial competence.  Understanding spatial  development is an important theoretical goal in itself, but also  has implications for such important societal iss ues as affording  mobility to visually-impaired children and furthering the  education of all children in spatial subjects such as geometry  and geography.    ***",
