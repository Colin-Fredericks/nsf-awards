Meyer  of the Department of Chemistry at the University of North  Carolina and Dr. F. Richard Keene of the Department of  Molecular Sciences at James Cook University of North Queensland.  The funds will primarily be used to support the travel expenses  yearly for two graduate students from the University of North  Carolina to spend two months in Dr. Keene's laboratory.  The  project focus is the design, preparation and exploitation of  molecular systems which take advantage of new techniques   developed at James Cook University.    The new synthetic methodology allows the preparation of ruthenium  complexes incorporating three different bidentate ligands.  Using  separate and overlapping electronic transitions involving each of  the three ligands, molecules will be developed which absorb light  from the UV through the visible and into the near-infrared.  The  collaborative development of novel chromatographic protocols will  allow the preparation of molecular assemblies incorporating these  antenna chromophores and energy transfer quenchers in a spatially  defined manner, with an eye toward practicality in light to  chemical energy conversion.  The collaboration builds upon the   expertise of Dr. Keene's laboratory which has developed synthetic  techniques utilized in the manipulation of isomeric octahedral  complexes and the North Carolina group under Dr. Meyer with  expertise in molecular design and photophysical characterization.   The combination of the two group's strengths should contribute to  advances in understanding the conversion of light to chemical  energy.  The work in Australia is supported through the  Department of Industry, Science and Tourism (DIST).",
