However,  little  work is done to  understand  the  surface  interfacial  phenomena  that determine these exciting  properties.  In addition the properties of the bulk  materials still remain elusive.  A Conference  and Workshops  on the properties of quasicrystals  will  be held  at Iowa  State University, August 19-23 1996. The conference will  discuss (1) existing and potential applications of  quasicrystals,  (2) surface  interface properties of  quasicrystals, and (3) potential  new quasicrystalline  materials. The objective of  the  conference  is  to bring  leading scientists from France and Japan and stimulate  national and  international collaborations necessary for  further growth of this important field of research in the  US.  %%%  Quasicrystals are structures which have recently become  an  important topic of research because of their potential  technological importance, for  example,  as  wear-resistant,  corrosion resistant,  low  friction coatings.
