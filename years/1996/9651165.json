 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports major improvements in the geographic information systems (GIS) laboratory. GIS has proven to be an effective and versatile learning and research tool enhancing student research, independent study, and senior (honors) projects in environmental science and human ecology.   The project addresses the need to replace obsolete and less efficient equipment in order to strengthen and revise current courses and to develop the capacity to design more advanced curricula. Faculty and students from each academic resource area have the opportunity to engage in advanced research and pursue digital environmental modeling projects, applying the most powerful version of ArcInfo software. Six Pentium-class PCs running X-terminal emulation software, networked to a SPARCstation 10, replace six older PC computers. The new system provides courses with access to data and software managed by the SPARCstation server. Current courses are enhanced as new technical features are introduced through the lab, including modeling and analytical tools for working with physiographic data and satellite imagery and tools to create graphic user interfaces and customized programs for specific applications.   Measurable outcomes from the project include substantially enhanced courses along with increased numbers of students doing independent study and research; new and advanced projects undertaken; and dissemination of distinctive applications of GIS technology in an interdisciplinary science-oriented program.",
