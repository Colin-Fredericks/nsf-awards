Wood's career reflects the intellectual history  of U.S. biochemistry, from his early research (with Chester Werkman) that identified and  elucidated the process of carbon dioxide fixation, through later studies of the enzymes involved  in that metabolic process, to his last work on the structure and sequence of genes that code for  those proteins.  Wood also built a strong training program in biochemistry at Case Western  Reserve University Medical School, and through his mentorship conveyed to students both the  craft of science and its ethos.  Finally, Wood involved himself in the public issues of the day,  through service to professional societies, journals, and the nation (as a Presidential Science  Advisor).",
