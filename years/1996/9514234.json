 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514234  Stomp  This award provides support for purchase of equipment required for the establishment in the U.S. of a collection of diverse isolates of Lemna, also known as duckweed.  Lemna is a monocotyledon that grows as a free-floating plant in slow moving lakes and stream and is of considerable potential for basic studies in the biology of plants and for more applied uses as a source of animal feed and specialty chemicals.    The collection consists of about 1000 strains collected by Dr. Elias Landolt of the University of Zurich over the course of his scientific career; these isolates represent all 32 known species of Lemna and most of the geographic range of the organism.  The collection is being moved to the U.S. where it will be made available to other researchers by the awardee.  ***",
