 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522004  Church    Pb isotopes will be used as tracers to quantify the atmospheric  inputs to and biogeochemical processes in the surface waters of the  Sargasso Sea off Bermuda, and data will be gathered in the South  Atlantic as part of a proposed third IOC trace element cruise  during the same period. This is a coordinated effort between the  University of Delaware Principal Investigators and other  institutions. Included are those currently active in studies of the  Bermuda atmosphere as part of the AEROCE program in its third phase  with support from NSF-ATM, and other scientists investigating the  major nutrient cycles, productivity, and associated carbon based  flux (JGOFS-BATS and associated activities) in the waters off  Bermuda under NSF-OCE support.  Existing archived samples of  precipitation and oceanic flux particles will be utilized first if  they satisfy clean collection criteria.  The proposed study will  focus on the element Pb and its isotope tracers which include  stable Pb (204,206,207,208), and the radioactive nuclide 210Pb with  the associated parent/daughter pairs which are part of the series  226 Ra, 222Rn,  210Bi, and 210Po.  Lead and its isotopes will be  measured in individual and integrated atmospheric samples to be  taken at the AEROCE Bermuda site, and on board several cruises off  Bermuda. The radioactive lead (210Pb) and its disequilibrium with  the daughters 210Bi and 210Po will reveal of atmospheric and  surface ocean scavenging.  The half lives of these isotopes (5 and  138 days respectively) should be commensurate with processes such  as aqueous scavenging of particle reactive elements (such as Bi),  and bio-active elements (such as Po).  Through modeling of  dissolved 210 Po profiles in the surface mixed layer down to the  thermocline, eddy diffusion co-efficients in the surface waters  will be determined and subsequently used to place constraints on  new production rates.  Generally, lead isotope modeling will  constrain vertical and horizontal contribution s to the surface  waters, and calibrate the mixing and particle scavenging of Pb.",
