 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ash 9531675  This award provides funding for a project that addresses some of the  connections between groups of integral matrices and the number theoretical aspects of systems of polynomial equations with integer coefficients. In particular, it studies the cohomology of arithmetic groups as a  module for the Hecke algebra, with connections to motives and Galois  representations and automorphic forms on adele groups. A theory of  p-adic families of cohomology classes for general arithmetic groups,  with particular application to subgroups of finite index in GL(m) is considered. Also investigated is a series of computer calculations designed to probe for the existence of non-selfdual automorphic  representations of cohomological type, and another series to test a  conjecture  relating modular Galois representations to Hecke eigenclasses in the cohomology of GL(3,Z) with twisted coefficients mod p.  This project falls into the general area of Arithmetic Algebraic  Geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: Number Theory and Geometry.  This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.",
