The fundermental  premise of this model is that significant integration of technology into teaching will only  occur with the simultaneous engagement of university science and mathematics  faculty, university teach education faculty, students in K-12 school districts.    In the fall of 1994 the Deans of the College of Education and the College of Natural  Science agreed to place a high priority on developing collaboration between the two  colleges around the integration of technology in teaching, both for university courses  and for preservice and inservice work with K-12 teachers.  Pursuant to that priority  they appointed a planning committee with representatives from the two colleges, the  Office of Computing and Technology, and the Ingham Intermediate School District.    Concurrently, the College of Education, with support from the University and private  industry, designed a new Technology Exploration Center that embodies innovative  design principles that offer a unique approach to integrating technology into education.   This center, which opened in January 1995, is located in a highly visible, central  location in the College of Education, is organized around subject matter applications  and is designed to create a socially inviting environment to stimulate discourse about  educational among faculty, students, teachers and school children.    In April 1995 the planning committee hosted the first \"Technology in Education  Showcase\" in the Center in which nine university faculty presented their uses of  technology in teaching to an invited group of faculty from the two colleges, K-12  teachers, Intermediate School Representatives, and graduate students.  The showcase  stimulated a high level of engagement and discourse about the possibiliti es and  challenges of integrating technology in teaching.    The planning grant will support a yearlong series of four such technology showcase  meetings, including outside speakers, that would be open to a wide audience with the  specific intent of developing a full proposal for a systemic approach to extending this  model to a larger educational community.  Study groups including faculty, students  and teachers will be organized around new hardware and software applications.  In  addition, the grant will support making these deliberations visible on the internet, both  to invite input from other universities around the country and to share the emergent  model.  The model will address a priority identified in NSF's Division of Undergraduate  Education: \"A major emphasis is teacher preparation programs that feature both small-  and large-scale efforts to engage the nation's college and university faculties in the  undergraduate education of the next generation of K-12 science and mathematics  teachers.\"    ***",
