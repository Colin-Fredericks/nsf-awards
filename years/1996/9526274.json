The initial objective is to study  the electronic properties of  porous materials such as  zeolites and silica and the closely related clathrates and  clathrasils.  The ground state electronic energy  calculations are carried out in an accurate, first  principles, selfconsistent way developed by the PI and along  with quantum molecular dynamics capabilities, allow  determination of structural and dynamic properties of  various possible cage-like structures.  New applications  will also be explored.  These include self-assembled-caged  semiconductor clusters and wires.  These artificially  created quantum dots and wires may have \"tunable\" bandgaps  and lattice spacings, depending on the zeolite framework (or  clathrates) and choice of semiconductor compound.  %%%  Zeolites and related silica are used commonly in petroleum  and drug industries.  Structurally they consist of cages  connected by channels and they are used mainly to exchange  or \"crack\" foreign atoms and molecules within these channels  or cages. This grant is to conduct theoretical research for  a better understanding of the zeolites and similar clathrate  compounds (have cages but no channels) and their  applications.  The principal method of study is a formalism  developed earlier by the PI.  ***",
