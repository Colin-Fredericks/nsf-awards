Courts with discretion to select appeals they want to hear can move legal policies and constitutional law in particular directions by choosing some cases and by ignoring others.  The literature on the United States Supreme Court suggests that: (1) the Court's decisions reflect jurisprudential criteria and concerns; (2) the agenda setting process is influenced by litigant resources; and (3) justices on the Court vote strategically in accordance with their policy goals and expectations of success. Very little comparative research has been done in other developed democracies to test the generalizability of the American literature. Here comparative research that replicates the methods and findings in the United States will be conducted on the Supreme Court of Canada. There are significant institutional and procedural differences between the U.S. and Canadian court that make the latter an important case testing and identifying the conditions for the U.S.-derived hypotheses. This study employs a triangulated research to generate the quantitative, qualitative, and archival data to develop a comprehensive explanation of how the Supreme Court of Canada decides to decide and how it differs from the United States.  %%%%  Control over agendas, deciding what to decide, is a significant exercise of power.
