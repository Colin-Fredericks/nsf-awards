 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a major revision and modernization of the laboratories associated with the 2-semester General Physics course sequence. This sequence serves 700 students each year and is required by 17 degree programs. These programs include biology, chemistry, kinesiology, geosciences, and the premedical and pre-physical-therapy curricula, with a combined enrollment of 1,200 majors, from a highly ethnically diverse student body.    The project addresses three curricular deficiencies: insufficient development of students' quantitative skills, insufficient development of physical intuition, and insufficient relevance for non-physics-majors. All three deficiencies stem from the inadequate involvement of the students as active and involved participants in the learning process. The computer data acquisition, analysis, and simulation approach, coupled with more relevant new experiments, enables students to become active, interested learners in the laboratory, not just recorders of data. The department is equipping the existing nonmajor laboratories with computer stations (one station/two students). Each station includes an interface unit and sensors to allow direct computer acquisition of such quantities as position, force, temperature, sound, light intensity, and magnetic field level. These stations also include a simulation and visualization capability using the Interactive Physics II software and CD-ROM based visualization materials.     Project experiences and laboratory manuals will be shared with the physics community over the World Wide Web and in workshops at meetings, as well as through publications and presentations.",
