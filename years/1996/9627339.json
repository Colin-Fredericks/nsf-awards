 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores two phases in the rise of the research  school of bimolecular crystallography at Oxford, the only research  school in international renown led by a woman, and the only such  school to include a critical mass of women members.  Led by Dorothy  C. Hodgkin (1910-1994), a sole Nobelist in chemistry (1964), this  research school distinguished itself by successfully solving the  structure of a series of biological compounds of increasing  structural complexity, including the sterol (sex hormones) in the  late 1930s; penicillin (the miracle drug for infectious diseases,  especially in WW2) in the 1940s; vitamin B-12 (the factor needed to  prevent pernicious anemia) in the 1950s; and insulin (the hormone  regulating sugar metabolism) in the 1960s.  This project focuses on  the relationship between molecular and social complexity in the  work on the structure of penicillin (1940s) and vitamin B-12 (the  1950s), phases in which women were key members of the research  teams.    First, the project explores the gender dimensions of this research  school, while focusing on: a) the recruitment and retaining of  members of both sexes in a research school led by a woman, at a  time very few women persisted in science, let alone in positions of  authority; b) the career patterns of the women members, in and out  of a school in which they both had a distinguished role model and  a \"critical mass\".  this part of the project can offer important  historical lessons for framing a science policy agenda to foster  gender equality in 21st Century science.    Second, the project clarifies the social processes of cross-gender  collaboration and the scientific outcomes involved in the  transition from the X-ray crystallography of \"small\" biological  molecules to that of large macromolecule (proteins and DNA), a  transition crucial for our understanding of the molecular  revolution in 20th Century biology.    Interactive activities include: teaching a new research seminar on  \"History and social implic ations of molecular biology and  biotechnology\" for one term; teaching a new undergraduate course on  \"New direction in the history of women in science\" for another  term, and organizing a workshop on \"Science policy or social policy  for women in science: From historical case-studies to an agenda for  the 21st Century\".",
