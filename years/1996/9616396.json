Content for the base digital library will be drawn from the seven archival, manuscript, and museum repositories at UCLA.    The development and testing of the DPA process model builds on the work of, and feeds into several educational and technological initiatives underway at UCLA, including cross-disciplinary collaborations with the Smithsonian Institution, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Special Collections at the UCLA University Research Library.  This planning grant will generate: (1) generalizable processes for structuring digital libraries and enriching content descriptions that meet the needs of primary content creators, providers, and non-traditional users such as teachers and students; (2) knowledge of how teachers might select primary content and integrate it into classroom activities if it were digitally accessible; and (3) knowledge of how digitized primary sources might contribute to the enhancement of students' understanding of, and engagement in, the health and natural sciences.",
