The first step in the framework involves using distributed parameter control theory for PDE  control problems to obtain an explicit infinite dimensional control law.  The controller is  based on compensator design so that state estimates are used (requiring only a small  number of state measurements) as opposed to full-state feedback, in which the full  distributed state must be known.  The next step relies on obtaining integral  representations of feedback control operators in terms of feedback functional gains.  The  use of the special spatial structure of these functional gains allows for approximation  schemes which result in low-order controllers.  Moreover, analysis of local dynamics  motivated by such approximations will give insight into sensor placement and design.  This  work provides a framework for practical controller designs which are computationally  efficient.  Moreover, it provides answers to questions regarding sensor design, specifically  regarding types and locations of sensors within a moving fluid.   %%%  This project will development a practical framework for the control of complicated systems  for which traditional approaches either are limited in scope or are impractical.  This  framework provides a computationally quick and efficient control design based on  fundamental mathematical concepts.  One of the principal applications of this research will  be to the design and placement of control devices for the control of high performance  aircraft, through a better understanding of the interactions of the aircraft with the  surrounding fluid.  ***",
