 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support  for the creation of a Plasma Spectroscopy Laboratory for the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences (COAS) at Oregon State University, recognized as one of the ten major -JOI+ oceanographic institutions.  Three outdated, interconnected laboratories in Burt Hall will be renovated to provide integrated management and sample preparation for an existing emission plasma spectrometer and two existing atomic absorption instruments.  An adjoining laboratory will be converted into an electronics shop and clean room.  Current laboratories are not suitable for the low level work conducted in the facility.  Renovations will include: remodeling space, refurbishing existing cabinets and counters, replacing corroded metal sinks and fixtures, and installing new ductwork, fume hoods and air conditioning units.  To make the facility safe and more cost-effective to operate, an uninterrupted power supply and a central recirculating water chiller will be included.  This project will elevate the quality of science produced by  reducing the possibility of contamination, and guaranteeing the integrity of samples during sample preparation and analysis. Research training for students will be enhanced, as well as accommodating more students, faculty and visiting scientists conducting research in the facility.",
