 "awd_abstract_narration": "The visual cortex of the brain is a major site of activity involved in visual perception.  This large network of interacting nerve cells, or neurons, analyzes the activity of neural information coming from the eyes, and generates activity patterns itself.  The precise mechanisms of how this analysis is achieved have not yet been fully detailed at the level of neurons and connections between neurons.  There are a variety of categories of interacting nerve cell classes, based on their morphology, connections, electrophysiological characteristics, and areas of the visual field to which they respond.  This project uses electrophysiological, anatomical and computational tools to see how function and structure are correlated in this complex structure.  Recent results from several laboratories have revealed a pattern of synchronization in a subset of cortical neurons, showing oscillatory electrophysiological activity at frequencies in the range of 30-60 Hz.  This project is designed to reveal some of the cellular mechanisms which may underlie how these synchronized oscillations depend on the configuration of visual stimuli, and which may play a role in sensory processing.     Results from this work will be important in testing a currently controversial issue of visual processing, and will be important beyond visual physiology, to help understand cortical and complex brain organization in general, and to understand mechanisms of perception of the external environment.",
