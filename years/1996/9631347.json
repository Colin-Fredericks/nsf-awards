 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9631347  In response to the shrinking academic job market for mathematicians, the School of Mathematics at the University of Minnesota has developed new educational programs to train mathematics students for nonacademic positions and an active industrial research program to provide mathematics faculty with new research opportunities.  The Minnesota Center for Industrial Mathematics (MCIM) and the well-established faculty in Numerical Analysis propose to join forces to enhance further these existing educational and research activities. The MCIM, established in 1993, is devoted to conducting research in partnership with industry and to providing career training and opportunities for students seeking employment in business, industry and government laboratories. The industrial/business student internship is the cornerstone of this program.  The program in Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing is devoted to conducting multi-disciplinary research primarily with university based scientists.  The educational program serves to train mathematics students for both academic and industrial employment as well as to provide service training for many engineering students.  Partnership with Industry is being developed through the MCIM. In fact, the two groups, MCIM and Numerical Analysis, have an overlapping membership.  A common goal of these groups is to improve the quality of education, research and career opportunities for students bound for the industrial, business and scientific workplace.  This award will expand and strengthen these educational and research programs through support for graduate students, an experimental computing laboratory and career development services.  This award is consistent with the GOALI activity, in that the funding awarded is centered on the activity of graduate students who will be in real industrial settings.",
