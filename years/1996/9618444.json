 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award is to provide support for a `U.S.-Egypt Workshop on Manufacturing Technology` to be held in Alexandria, Egypt, December 7-9, 1996.  The U.S. organizer is Dr. Mansour Mohamed, Head, Department of Textile Engineering, Chemistry and Science at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC.  The Egyptian organizer is Dr. Nabiel A. Saleh, Vice President, the National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt.  Twenty scientists representing U.S. academic and industrial concerns will participate.  From Egypt, participants will include scientists from the NRC, academic institutions and public and private industrial research organizations.  The workshop will allow these scientists to discuss the scientific and technical questions that affect the manufacturing of products in four industries: textiles, paper and pulp, pesticides, and polymers, and to identify areas where joint U.S.-Egypt research can benefit industries in the two countries, and hopefully advance the state of the art in these areas.  The workshop plans envision exchange of state of the art papers, by the two side, few weeks in advance of the December meeting, in depth discussions of the information exchanged during the meeting and specific recommendations for viable cooperative research projects.  This project plan includes visits by separate groups of scientists to specific industries in the four areas, in Egypt before and following the three day meeting.  Scope:  This award supports U.S. scientists in a project that has high priority for the two countries.  There is an evident need in Egypt, and in a large number of other developing countries, to bring and adapt modern technologies and manufacturing procedures into its industrial infrastructure if she is to maintain stable and improving economic conditions.  The U.S. side has a chance to deal with nascent industries, or old industries that need to be revamped, and to gain valuable experiences in the process.  Some of the joint research projects that may result from this workshop could have technical benefits to U.S. industries and to machinery manufacturers, and instruments manufacturers in the U.S.  This project is endorsed by the Governments of the U.S. and Egypt.  They plan to consider support of the joint research within the scope of increasing the cooperation between the two countries in the science and technology area.",
