 "awd_abstract_narration": "9528517  Anderson  The primary goal of this project is to predict the strong ground  motions which will result from future earthquakes, with  sufficient precision to be reliable for engineering applications;  and equally important, to develop a system in which this  capability will be readily available to anyone.  Data from the US-  Mexico strong motion array in Guerrero, Mexico provides one  important means to calibrate the method, since it covers a large  range of magnitudes and distances with stations on rock.  Calibrations are also made with other data from throughout the  world. The first year addresses the system for stations on rock;  the second year concentrates on predictions for stations on  sediments, including nonlinear effects; while the third year  focuses on implementing 2D and 3D basin effects into the  predictions. The aim is to make the system very easy for the  user.    Predicted strong motions are to be in the form of very realistic  synthetic seismograms. The seismogram provides a link between the  seismologist and the engineer; the numerous parameters that  describe aspects of strong earthquake ground motions are all  derived from accelerograms. A goal of this project is to work  toward the time when regression analysis will be replaced by the  generation of suites of synthetic accelerograms that are  appropriate for the magnitude, distance, region, and site of  interest, and which are closely calibrated by observations. These  suites of accelerograms are used to obtain the mean and the  variability of the desired ground motion parameter for the  application of interest.    This process will be made easily available to anyone with  Internet access to the World Wide Web (WWW). The WWW page will be  set up so that anyone accessing it can generate synthetic  accelerograms. The user will be guided through a set of questions  which will specify the necessary input, generate one or many  seismograms, and retrieve the complete time series or commonly  used parameters (such as peak  acceleration or spectral amplitude)  specified.    Some state-of-the-art projects on seismic hazard are already  using synthetic seismograms. These same techniques will be  available to any design project, leading to improved earthquake-  resistant designs at all levels.  ***",
