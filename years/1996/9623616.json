 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program will help the  Department of Chemistry at  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill acquire a modern 500  MHz NMR spectrometer and upgrade an existing Varian XL-400 MHz and a Bruker MSL-  300WB NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas  including the following: transition metal catalyst olefin polymerization; total synthesis of  complex natural products; polymerizations in supercritical fluids; engineering of non-genetic  proteins; development of 2D pulsed field gradient NMR experiments, relationships between  protein structure, stability and function; structure and design of ferroelectric liquid crystals;  synthesis and application of phosphorous-capped metal clusters; and enantioselective reactions  of metal complexes.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.",
