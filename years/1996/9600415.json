 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to investigate a number of topics in theoretical  physics.  One concerns the origin of the violation of time-  reversal symmetry, one of the greatest mysteries in physics, and  observed in decays of the K-meson.  The nature of this violation  isn't well understood.  A particular rare decay of the K-meson is  extremely sensitive to time-reversal violation, but is very  difficult to detect.  Recently, it has been realized that it may  be measurable at TUNAF or BNL.  We plan to calculate the decay  rate in a wide variety of models of particle interactions.  Another topic concerns neutrinos scattering off the deuteron,  where more protons are produced in the forward direction than one  expects.  This is often attributed to rescattering in the  deuterium nucleus.  Relativistic effects also affect the  expectations, and we wish to determine the size of these effects.  This is the largest uncertainty in determining the reaction rate  of neutrinos off neutrons and protons.  Still another topic  concerns a popular theory in particle physics, based on  supersymmetry.  Although most new particles predicted by  supersymmetry are very heavy, there remains the possibility that  one, the gluino, is light, and detectable at TUNAF and/or BNL.  We've examined this previously and will work closely with  experimenters in planned searchers.",
