 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital signal processors (special-purpose fast microprocessors),  made possible through advances in integrated circuits, have added  a new element to the environment of digital signal processing  (DSP).  These processors have found their way into a number of  applications including communications and controls, graphics,  instrumentation, speech, and image processing.  They have emerged  as a response to the ever-increasing number of real-time DSP  applications.  This workshop will combine both the lecture and  laboratory components of DSP, with a special emphasis on the  laboratory component, providing the participants valuable hands-on  experiences.  The undergraduate faculty participants will implement  a wide range of real-time experiments and mini-projects such as a  digital oscillator, finite and infinite impulse response filters,  adaptive filters, and the fast Fourier transform.  Available tools  and techniques will be provided to the faculty participants who  will quickly realize how software and hardware experiences can be  used to motivate their senior students.  They would then be able to  integrate these software and hardware experiences into senior-level  courses at their home institutions.",
