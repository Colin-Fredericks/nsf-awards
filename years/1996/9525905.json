 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kevorkian DMS-9525905  This proposal concerns research that  builds on the PI's recent work  in developing multiple scale  asymptotic expansions that approximate  solutions over long  periods and in the far field for weakly nonlinear  conservation  laws with source terms. The primary effect of source  terms is  that the leading approximation in the multiple scale  expansion  is complicated; in general, it involves an integral   representation that has to be analyzed asymptotically for large  time  before one can derive the appropriate evolution equations.   Extensions of previous work to include the effects of variable   coefficients, leading order diffusion, and resonant wave  interactions  are outlined. In particular, it is proposed to  study wave propagation  problems with axial or radial symmetry  where radial dependence  occurs in the source terms. A second  phase of the research involves a  class of problems where the  usual Ginzburg-Landau technique does  not apply because the  linearly most unstable wave number equals  zero. Problems with  three or more dependent variables involve a  further comlication,  the possibility of resonant interactions between  waves. The  combined effect of source terms snd resonant  interactions has  not been studied, and is one of the main goals of the  proposed  research.   This proposal outlines research in the approximate  analytic solution  of conservation laws when the desired solution  is close to one that is  known exactly. Conservation laws that  model physical or biological  processes typically involve source  terms as well as diffusive terms.  Source terms usually arise  when reactions are present, whereas  diffusive terms often  account for dissipation. The effect of small  diffusion is  benign; as in many fluid dynamics problems, small  diffusion  corresponds to small viscosity and acts to \"smooth out\" the   solution in a thin layer centerd around a shock wave. If,  however,  diffusion occurs to leading order, as in many  biological applications,   the structure of the solution is  fundamentally altered. This proposal  identifies a class of  problems involving diffusion to leading order for  which the  standard approaches do not apply. It is also proposed to  study  the effect of source terms in systms that have three or more   interacting waves, as in gas dynamics for reacting flows. Here,  the  primary focus is to clarify the role of source terms in the  process that  governs the resonant interaction of these waves.",
