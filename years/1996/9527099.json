 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry   program  will study non-additivity of intermolecular interactions in a variety of   chemical  systems using first principles ab-initio quantum mechanical methods.   Weak intermolecular forces and interactions are of key importance in   studies  of the properties of matter in condensed phases. In such an environment,   the interaction   in a pair of molecules affects the ways each of them interacts with a   third.  The assumption of pairwise additivity of intermolecular interactions  is thus a very poor approximation.  Most current means of simulating  condensed phase reactions either disregard non-additivity of interactions  entirely, or attempt to include it in a very crude manner, mixed together  with a number of errors in the interaction potentials.  One common  misconception about non-additivity is that it originates from a single  source.  However, in reality it arises from a number of fundamentally  different physical phenomena.    This theoretical research is aimed at elucidating all of the effects   responsible  for non-additivity and to break these down into components which are   labeled   dispersion,  induction and exchange.  Such an analysis will lead to an   improved  understanding of these effects on a fundamental level. This work will   result  in the development of a number of analytical potentials which explicitly   include  many-body effects and are thus suitable for simulations of condensed   phases. as   well as properties of clusters.",
