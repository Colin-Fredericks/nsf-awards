 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ball  9514525    Numerous animals integrate various cues from the environment to  predict the arrival of improving conditions associated with spring.   Arguably the most critical cue is changing daylength, which is  responsible for enhancing numerous behaviors including  communicative behaviors.  Increasing daylength also fosters marked  chemical changes in the brain associated with the behavioral  changes. In these receptive animals, secondary features may  potentiate the positive aspects of increasing daylength.  However,  increasing daylength after a period of time precipitates the  development of refractoriness which terminates behavioral  enhancement and brain neurochemical changes. Dr. Gregory Ball is  assessing the interplay between daylength and secondary  characteristics in fostering seasonal behavioral changes.  The  studies include an identification of the neuronal circuitry  responsible for mediation of the behavioral changes in the animals,  as well as a demonstration of the specific secondary cues to which  the animals respond.  Studies to this point have not identified  specific features of the environment other than daylength as  enhancors of behavioral activity.  These studies will be useful to  understanding the survival of species in their nature habitats and  the environmental cues to which they are most responsive.",
