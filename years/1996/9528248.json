 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the   Chemistry Division, Kinsey will study the dynamics of molecular   photodissociation both experimentally and theoretically.  In the   experimental studies Dissociative Resonance Raman Spectroscopy (DRRS)   will be used to probe transient processes involved in the photochemical   decomposition of small molecules by detecting the weak emissions from   vibrationally excited states.  Light from many vibrational levels will be   accumulated using a newly constructed instrument in order to obtain a   complete description of the dissociation.  Mathematical functions called   wavelets will be employed to model photodissociation processes   efficiently.  Theoretical studies will aid in interpreting the   experimental Raman data, which will be inverted mathematically to   determine the potential energy surface directly.  Photochemical decompositions are among the most fundamental and important   of chemical processes.  For example, a detailed elucidation of how   sunlight leads to ozone decomposition is essential if we hope to alter   the environmental consequences of ozone layer depletion.  The early   stages of such photochemical reactions are very difficult to study in the   laboratory since they are over in less time than light takes to travel   0.001 inches.  Prof. Kinsey's studies of photochemical decomposition will   provide powerful new tools for gaining insight into reactions which occur   on such a fast timescale.",
