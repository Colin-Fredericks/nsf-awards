The viscoelastic behavior of selected  inorganic glass-formers, including selenium, sulfur, boron  trioxide, arsenic selenide, arsenic telluride, arsenic sulfide,  germanium dioxide, and various compositions of germanium-arsenic-  selenium will be examined both above and below their glass  transition temperatures (Tg). The establishment of a  characteristic variable for glass formation, based on the growing  evidence of a common molecular mobility at the glass transition  temperature will be attempted. This attempt will entail proper  determination of the glass temperatures of these materials during  cooling using volume dilatometry and differential scanning  calorimetry in order to use the glass transition  temperature(Tg)as a corresponding state parameter. The  viscoelastic measurements made above Tg are also anticipated to  resolve the issue of whether molecular networks are present in  some inorganic glasses, and will allow determination of whether  molecular moieties in these glasses are fixed or in dynamic  equilibrium. The data obtained will also be used to test the  generality of the relationship which has been found between the  time and temperature dependencies of the viscoelastic behavior of  organic materials. Finally the viscoelastic data obtained below  Tg, coupled with dilatometry and calorimetric data, will be used  to determine whether decoupling of different irreversible  processes occurs in inorganic glasses.  %%%  This research will enhance the understanding of inorganic glass  structure and the correlation of structure with properties in an  attempt to learn how to control structures to obtain desired  properties.  Establishing the behavior of these inorganic  materials when compared to other glass formers in terms of  dynamic states above and below  glass transition temperatures is  an important goal, and given the fact that the solid-state  inorganic materials are similar to silica, the potential impact  on innovative technologies such as optical fibers is high.  ***",
