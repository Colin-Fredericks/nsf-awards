 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop focusing on the process for initiation, management and  assessment of significant curriculum changes within undergraduate  engineering programs will be presented.  Participants will be  provided with (1) lessons learned elsewhere and (2) plans and  guidance for how to implement curriculum changes in their own  schools.  There have been numerous forums and workshops developing  prescriptions for curriculum changes, and a general consensus has  emerged that substantial changes are needed in many programs.   However, reforming engineering curricula has proven difficult  except for occasional courses with existing programs.  This  workshop is not intended to prescribe necessary changes, but to  focus on how to achieve such changes:  how to insure faculty \"buy-  in\", how to assess budgetary impacts, how to organize committees,  etc.  Participation will be sought from a broad range of  engineering schools.  The workshop will be held at Carnegie Mellon  University in June, 1996, and the written materials developed for  the workshop and subsequently emerging will be available in written  form and via the World Wide Web.",
