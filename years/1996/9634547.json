 "awd_abstract_narration": "The performance of massively parallel multicomputers depends  largely on their processor management scheme. Unfortunately,  the schemes employed in the current generation of commercial  multicomputers do not efficiently utilize the system  resources. Processor management is concerned with processor  allocation and job scheduling. Processor allocation also  affects the interprocessor communication latency.  Researchers have addressed these issues independently of  each other. However, it is essential to evaluate the  combined effect of these issues on system performance. Thus,  this project focuses on an integrated study of processor  allocation, job scheduling, and interprocessor  communication. The research objectives will be accomplished  in three phases. The first phase  encompasses the design and  development of efficient processor allocation and job  scheduling schemes while employing a suitable message  routing algorithm for interprocessor communication. In the  second phase, the integrated effect of allocation,  scheduling, and interprocess communication on system  performance is to be studied. The third phase of the  proposed research is concerned with the experimental  validation of these schemes.  ***",
