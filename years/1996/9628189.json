 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal introduced an original architectural approach for a scalable  integrated optical network consisting of \"LAN\" segments with varying  topologies interconnected by bridges. The investigators first investigate  the two most promising topologies, rings and folded buses, interconnected  directly by a bridge. Since in each case synchronization requirements and  implementation issues vary, certain topologies may be preferred in  different areas of the interconnected network.  The investigators also  propose to consider a network backbone that serves as an interconnect  structure among dozens of subnetworks.  In each subnetwork (rings or buses)  packets are individually inserted into and extracted from the fiber medium,  while in the backbone slot routing is used to exchange information between  pairs of subnetworks.    The bridge architecture is one of the main foci of this proposal which will  be investigated covering all main options - a bridge without optical  buffering, a bridge with optical buffering (SDL-bridge), and associated  protocols for controlling the bridge operation  and contention resolution,  including the slot-override solution.    The node architecture of bridged network nodes must take into account: the  type of transceiver, the optical interface to the network, and the  buffer  organization at the transmitter. The transmitters and the receivers  can be  tunable or fixed, with at least one of the two devices being tunable  to  provide full connectivity among the nodes. These node architecture  options  will be investigated together with the new protocols to support  different  \"sorting algorithms\" needed to deal with bridge operation to  avoid the  creation of electronic bottlenecks.    The slot routing related protocols and control are a key factor in  the  global network performance. In order to allocate slots between local and  internetwork traffic a slot management protocol is necessary.  Two  possibilities will be evaluated: a fixed slot allocation protocol, which   allocates slots in a preset order, determined by expected traffic and by  network conditions, and a dynamic slot allocation protocol, which  allocates slots according to the instantaneous offered load of each  network segment.    Analytical models and simulation tools will be extensively used to assess  the performance of the different solutions.",
