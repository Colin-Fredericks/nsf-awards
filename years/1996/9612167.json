S. have identified electronic media as a strategic technology for   communication and information dissemination to their members and other   stakeholders.  This workshop brings together representatives of leading   technical professional organizations, industry leaders in electronic   publishing, and university researchers to address issues in the strategic   management of electronic document creation and delivery.  Conversion to   electronic media for communication and information dissemination represents   a significant organizational culture change that can be studied as a   process of technology diffusion within a social system.  Discussion at the   workshop will focus on technological choices, major impediments to   adoption, and means for overcoming them.  Recommendations will be made for   effective creation and delivery of electronic documents that are responsive   to the information needs of engineering and scientific communities.   The workshop will result in recommendations regarding technological   choices, recommendations for overcoming obstacles to the implementation of   electronic publishing, and mechanisms focused on the engineering and   scientific communities' requirements.  Workshop proceedings will be widely   disseminated to allow implementation of the recommendations in a   straightforward manner.",
