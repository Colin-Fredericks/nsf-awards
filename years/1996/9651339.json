 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposed work, we intend to merge the technology of using computers in the laboratory for introductory physics with the problem solving pedagogy we have found to be successful with large classes at the University of Minnesota. Where applicable, we intend to make extensive use of video data acquisition techniques. The goal is to produce a one year, computer-based introductory physics laboratory that is directly applicable to large classes and also suitable for small classes interested in stressing a problem-solving approach to introductory physics.   This laboratory will build upon our current laboratory manuals and apparatus. We expect that certain laboratory problems will be easily adapted to the computer and others will not. In addition, new problems will be added which were not possible without the technological strengths of the computer. We intend to use a commercially available software environment. One which is commonly used in engineering and research is LabVIEW/Labwindows. We will adapt LabVIEW to existing hardware packages, such as NIH image for video analysis, and the tools used in CUPLE and Real-time Physics.   This proposal will bring together the problem-solving expertise of the University of Minnesota with the technical experience of Hamline University. The formative and summative evaluation of this project will use ethnographic and numerical techniques to determine successful attainment of our goals. The results of this project will be disseminated through the American Journal of Physics, relevant conferences, and workshops.",
