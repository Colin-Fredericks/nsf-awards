 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634255  Ilic  Electric power systems in the United States and many other parts of  the world are undergoing drastic restructuring.  The trend is  toward deregulating an industry that has traditionally been a  regulated monopoly to allow for economic competition.         Much confusion arises in discussing technical and economic  concepts supporting the two extremes of industry structure.  At one  extreme, some advocate preserving and building upon the present  technical framework and standards for operating an interconnected  system while yet accommodating competitive non-utility-owned  generation.  At the other extreme are those who believe electric  power systems should be restructured based entirely on economic  competition.  A change of thinking is needed in both engineering  and economic circles to put the debate in a meaningful framework,  which is essential for ensuring that, whichever industry structure  prevails, basic principles of technical operation as well as the  free market economy are met.       This is a tall order for researchers concerned with large  dynamic electric power systems.  The issues are system-theoretic in  their basic nature.  True, researchers with a strong back-ground in  large systems could identify many new theoretical issues and their  solutions within the context of existing problems directly relevant  to the power industry.  But in order to avoid technical assumptions  that may not hold in all cases, one needs a systematic framework  for posing these problems.       In this project, we will use much of our acquired knowledge   as the starting point to further study the problems of hierarchical  controls in a changing electric power industry.  In what follows,  we describe the importance of the envisioned control structures in  a changing industry, and propose several specific problems that  will be studied.    ***",
