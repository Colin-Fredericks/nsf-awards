 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT        9629768  Scharfen    Recognizing the scientific and economic value of the data  obtained from research activities in Antarctica and the need  to make this information available to the greater scientific  community, the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research  (SCAR) instituted an ad hoc Planning Group on Antarctic Data  Management to provide recommendations on the preservation  and management of research and related data from Antarctic  programs.  The ad hoc planning group recommended that an  Antarctic Master Data Directory be established for handling  meta data and that each national program designate their own  National Antarctic Data Center (NADC) for management of data  from individual national programs.  These recommendations  were endorsed by the Antarctic Treaty Parties and by SCAR.    The World Data Center-A for Glaciology/National Snow and Ice  Data Center (WDC-A/NSIDC) will serve as the U.S. NADC for an  initial period of three years.  This effort will consist of  identifying and describing existing data in all disciplines,  using an approach similar to that already underway for  cryospheric data, and submitting these descriptions (\"DIFs\",  the Directory Interchange Format used for the International  Directory Network) to the Antarctic Master Directory being  developed by the International Centre for Antarctic  Information and Research (ICAIR).  The WDC-A/NSIDC will take  advantage of its on-going relationship with the Global  Change Mater Directory (GCMD) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight  Center, sharing information regarding data sources and  minimizing or eliminating duplication of effort.  The  WDC-A/NSIDC will write or assist data holders in writing  DIFs for Antarctic data collected by U.S. investigators.  Before submitting DIFs to the AMD, the WDC-A/NSIDC will  review and edit them, if necessary, to ensure they are  compliant with format and content standards.",
