 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hao  9625183    This is an award to provide support for research aimed at  developing an approach to modeling nutrient removal from  wastewater by use of suspended growth bioreactors based on  coupling the use of artificial neural networks with  knowledge of the underlying biological processes that take  place within the reactors.  The investigators plan on using  a hybrid modeling approach that combines a simplified  process model and a neural network, the purpose of which is  to correct any errors encountered by use of the simplified  model.  Two hybrid modeling methods involving a series  structure and parallel structure will be used to integrate a  suspended growth reactor model and a neural network.  The  approach will be explored for potential use in both  sequential batch reactors and in a system for alternating  aerobic and anoxic conditions.    Results of this research are expected to enhance the  procedures by which complicated biological processes can be  designed, controlled and optimized.  The proposed concepts  to be investigated in this project are expected to enhance  process control in general and lead to engineering designs  that save energy in meeting stringent requirements for  removal of nutrients from wastewater prior to their  discharge to the environment.",
