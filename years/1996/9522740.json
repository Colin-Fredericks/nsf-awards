 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522740  Taylor  The overall objective of this research is to obtain analytical and  experimental results which support and promote the application of  high-electrooptic-coefficient tungsten bronze ferroelectric materials  (\"super-EO materials\") in a variety of guided wave optical devices.  Techniques developed at Texas A&M for making the first low-loss waveguides  and electrooptic modulators in tungsten bronze substrates will serve as the  foundation for the proposed project. The waveguides are produced by a  simple process in which static strain from a patterned surface film creates  a localized refractive index increase. The Rockwell International Science  Center, which has supplied super-EO materials to Texas A&M for several  years, will continue in this collaborative role during the course of the  proposed project.    Research will be conducted in five critical task areas: (1) static strain  optic (SSO) waveguide modeling, (2) device design, (3) material  characterization, (4) modulator and switch development, and (5) tunable  filter investigations. Two-dimensional refractive index profiles for TE and  TM polarizations in SSO waveguides will be computed, considering both  strain-optic and electrooptic contributions to the localized index change.  A variation method will be utilized for waveguide mode analysis. Parameters  needed for the waveguide and device models, such as strain-optic and  electrooptic coefficients, refractive indices, and thermal expansion  coefficients, will be measured. The recently discovered \"self-poling\"  effect will be investigated experimentally to determine the conditions  under which a large electrooptic effect is present without poling after  processing of an SSO device at elevated temperatures. Electrooptic cutoff  modulators, coupled waveguide switches, and tunable channel dropping  filters which make use of the SSO waveguides will be designed, fabricated  in the Rockwell substrates, and characterized.    The proposed research will lay the groundwork for using  super-EO materials  in guided wave devices which could find increasing application in broadband  communication networks over the next decade. Modulators and switches which  exhibit order-of-magnitude improvement in performance over their  counterparts in LiNbO3 - the traditional substrate of choice for guided  wave electrooptic devices - will be sought. New channel-dropping filters  for wavelength multiplexing with unprecedented tuning range, low crosstalk,  and minimal electrical power dissipation will be explored. Successful  demonstrations should reinforce Rockwell's expressed interest in  commercializing the tungsten bronze substrates so that they will be  generally available for research and device application.  ***",
