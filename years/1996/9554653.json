 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of South alabama and Tuskegee University will  conduct 2 workshops to train 20 faculty from two and four year  institutions to use a cognitive-based approach to curriculum  development, as applied to Introductory Computer Science Courses.\"   This project will act as a major dissemination of the results of a  previously awarded CCD.  The 1st week long workshop will be held  during the summer 1996, consisting of 3 major activities. First,  the participants will study the cognitive based process using: the  Bloom taxonomy (levels of learning), Bruner's spiral approach to  earning, Soloway's problem solving heuristics and code templates,  collaborative learning in structured labs (as described by Webb),  and system theory to provide frequent feedback and control of this  learning process.  The second activity will be to use this  knowledge to study the materials developed from the CCD project.   After the needed background has been developed, application to  curriculum issues will be covered.  The third and final activity  will be the use of this material to develop similar material for  the participants home institution.  As follow-up, 2 forums will be  used; a suitable national forum (eg. SIGCSE-97), and a weekend  workshop to beheld at Tuskegee University in the Spring 1997.  The  participants for these workshops will be selected from  applications, received as a result of public announcements.  Every  attempt will be made to select faculty from diverse institutions,  and to include a minimum of 25% participation from HBCUs.",
