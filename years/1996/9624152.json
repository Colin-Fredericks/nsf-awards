The starting point of our investigations is the problem of  robust digital control.  We take the view that a digital control  system is a mixture of continuous-time and discrete-time systems,  with the resulting periodic behaviour, and the related nonlinear  quantization effects due to finite wordlength computations.  For  this problem the issue is to develop a systematic theory where  one can analyze performance tradeoffs between sampling rates,  periodic behaviour, and quantization effects.  Such a theory does  not at present exist.  This leads us to develop compatible  techniques in two different directions with a wide range of  applicability.  First, we develop a framework for the analysis  and synthesis of mixed continuous-time discrete-time systems  which extends the principal investigators previous work on  sampled-data robust control.  The second direction involves the  analysis of systems with switching nonlinearities such as relays,  hysterisis, and quantization.  We show via a multirate sampling  technique (akin to Sigma-Delta modulators in signal processing)  that many problems with switching nonlinearities are equivalent  to analyzing a LTI system in feedback with a relay.  We address  the problems of computing limit cycles and their sensitivities in  terms of the input-output loo nonlinear for such systems. This  effort seems to provide a connection between robust control and  certain types of so-called \"intelligent systems.\"       In a parallel and related effort, the L1 model reduction  problem is addressed and its significance as a \"good\" norm for  model reduction is outlined.  This problem is also motivated from  the perspective of reduced order robust controller design for  la rge scale systems.  In the area of control oriented  identification, we address the novel problem of the  identification of parameter varying systems, whose models would  be more useful for process control problems such as in the  real-time control of semiconductor manufacturing, and situations  where the underlying processes undergo rapid changes in operating  conditions, for which a single LTI model is inappropriate.  Preliminary results are outlined as well as their connection and  implication for identification and modeling in the bahavioural  framework.       The educational part of this career plan is guided by the  principle that control and systems theory are fundamentally  interdisciplinary subjects.  This idea is apparent in research  problems that cross departmental boundaries.  In education, this  can be carried out with interdepartmental courses and  laboratories.  The current involvement of the principal  investigator in the establishment of an interdepartmental  controls laboratory, will be a guide to the establishment of  common courses in controls and systems.  Another component in  this plan is the incorporation of recent research results to  update graduate and undergraduate courses.  Specifically, we  outline ongoing efforts at incorporating recent results on  sampled-data control from the hybrid systems point of view in  digital control courses.  ***",
