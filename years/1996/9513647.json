 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Stanley Peters and three junior members of his research group at Stanford University to collaborate in linguistics research with Professor Frank Veltman and others of the Institute for Language, Logic and Computation of the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. They are studying abstract aspects of information content and informational equivalence, centering on the concept of `reciprocals` (the expertise of the US group) and `polyadic quantifiers` the logical tools used to define reciprocals (which is the area of expertise of the Dutch group.)  The Stanford group has undertaken a comparative study of the nature of the relation between syntactic representation and semantic interpretation, taking reciprocals as a case study. The Dutch group is part of a European consortium applying new understanding of the dynamic nature of information to the interpretation of natural language.  Dynamic interpretation is becoming increasingly important, not only in linguistics, but also in computer science and artificial intelligence.  This research provides US participants access to a larger regional European collaborative project named DYANA (`Dynamic Interpretation of Natural Language`) funded by the European Commission, which brings together some of the most important scholars in the foundations of language and information processing in Europe.  This relatively focused U.S.-Dutch research collaboration is intended to be the starting point for a broader and longer-term collaboration in the future. Their mutual goal is to develop theories of information that can be applied in a variety of areas within the study of language and computation.  The results of their research are likely to have far reaching implications, not only for the study of natural languages, but also for the analysis and design of computer languages.",
