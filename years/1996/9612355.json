 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a 3-year standard award. Computer support for  meeting scheduling is a focus of active research in several  areas, including distributed artificial intelligence (DAI)  and intelligent agents, software engineering, and  information systems. It is also of very high applied  interest. However, meeting scheduling is most significant in  being one of the first desktop group support applications  that is widely used in some organizations. The researchers  will conduct empirical studies of the use of this group  support technology in settings where existing technical  infrastructures and organizational practices enable all  employees, numbering hundreds or thousands, to fully  participate in the use of a shared system. A deep  understanding of successful practice will itself extend  knowledge of organizational behavior in this new  technological context, and it can also guide the research  and application of technologies and approaches developed in  the fields mentioned above. The researchers will conduct  detailed interviews, longitudinal observational studies, and  broad surveys to determine factors underlying the success of  particular applications, adoption trajectory within  organizations, and emergent behaviors including differences  in successful use across settings. They will also explore  the possibility of using this newly-emergent technology to  better understand issues of coordination of work and  technological impact within firms.",
