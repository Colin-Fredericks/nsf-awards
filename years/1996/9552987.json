 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9552987  Hawkins, William    The Mathematical Association of America, through its Strengthening  Underrepresented Minority Mathematics Achievement (SUMMA) Program,  will develop a second phase of its national SUMMA Consortium  (SUMMAC) of mathematics-based pre-college intervention projects in  order to strengthen the known projects directed by mathematicians  which reach more than 15,000 minority students each year.  This  three-year project will increase these 157 projects by at least 75  by 1998.    This network of mathematicians (collegiate faculty, school  teachers, and others) who conduct projects which focus on minority  students will engage in activities which include workshops,  conferences, publications, visits to each others' projects,  technical assistance, sharing curricula and mentoring.  The  mechanisms used to develop SUMMAC are intricately connected to the  structure of the 30,000-member MAA: regional workshops; minority  graduate students from MAA student chapters as counselors;  presentations at the Joint Mathematics Meetings.    Utilizing the leadership that developed in SUMMAC during the first  phase (1992-1995), regional coordinators who SUMMA grantees will  lead the workshops in their area of the country and make site  visits to new projects after receiving training from the SUMMA  staff.  The publications that were begun during the first phase  will continue: the Project Director's Handbook; an annual Directory  of Mathematics-based Intervention Projects; and a quarterly SUMMAC  Forum newsletter.  Two invitational conferences will be held each  year: one is for both experienced and novice directors.  The  second, supported through cost-sharing, will help novice directors  design projects and learn proposal writing techniques.  ***",
