Other directions of research are study of configuration spaces of  line arrangements and mechanical linkages in homogeneous metric  spaces in relation with the representation theory of certain classes  of finitely generated groups (Artin and Coxeter groups) and  investigation of the ``Riemann-Hilbert problem'' from the  topological point of view.       The project focuses in part on the structure of symmetries of  objects naturally arising in geometry, algebra, and differential  equations.  The ancient Greeks understood symmetries of Platonic  solids, e.g., a cube.  Platonic solids are positively curved, and they  have a finite number of symmetries.  At the opposite end of the  spectrum are negatively curved objects, such as the Lobachevsky  hyperbolic plane (featured frequently in Escher paintings), and  these typically have infinitely many symmetries.  Consequently, the  structure of these symmetries is both more interesting and harder to  understand.       Another part of the project is the study of linkages.  These are  mechanical devices constructed from rigid rods connected at joints.  It is a classical problem to describe the possible shapes traced out  by an end of a linkage after affixing another end with a nail.  For  example, a compass can be regarded as a (very simple) linkage, and it  traces out a circle.  This project explores the surprising  relationship between the shapes traced out by a linkage and  certain symmetries of spaces of solutions of algebraic equations.       The final part of the project is concerned with symmetries arising  from a system of differential equations.  ***",
