 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9625445  PI:  Manuel Lerman  University of Connecticut      Degree Theory analyzes the possible situations in which a program's oracle  has the knowledge to predict how other specified oracles will act, through  the use of an algebraic structure introduced by Post and Kleene fifty years  ago. One of the main goals of Degree Theory has been to determine how  closely this algebraic structure captures the notion of information  content. In other words, there is a desire to determine whether oracles  with different information content look different algebraically, or- if  not- whether this inability to differentiate between two oracles is  reflected in the algebraic structure in some more subtle way.  The main  tool for the study of the algebraic model of information content is the  \"priority method\".  Lerman is a co-developer of a framework which allows  one to apply this technique in very general situations.  The technique has  not only been applied to study structural questions about information  content, but has found applications to other areas of mathematical logic  and computer science.    Modern computing is interactive; programs pause frequently to ask for input  from an oracle (the user) before continuing.  Thus the true universal model  for computing is one in which an oracle is appended to the computer. This  project concerns the analysis of situations in which one oracle has the  knowledge to predict how other specified oracles will act. Lerman is a  co-developer of a framework which is used to analyze such programs, and is  currently refining this framework to more easily determine whether such  programs can be combined without producing conflicts. Insights obtained  from the framework will apply to a range of situations involving computer  programs with users who are providing input to the programs.",
