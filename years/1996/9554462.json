The organization has  received NSF support since 1989 to design, develop, and report on state by state  differences in elementary and secondary teacher and student participation in mathematics  and science courses and published reports in 1991, 1993, and1995.  This proposal would  conduct data collection and analysis for another year. It would also analyze current state  curriculum frameworks, develop state indicators and report trends in science and  mathematics education, conduct research on new measures of the enacted curriculum and disse  minate indicators in published reports.",
