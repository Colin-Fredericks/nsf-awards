 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program is providing support for   Philip M. Johnson of the State University of New York-Stony Brook to   develop a new method of laser spectroscopy, called photoinduced Rydberg   ionization spectroscopy (PIRI), which promises a substantial improvement   in the resolution attainable in the spectra of molecular cations.  This   technique relies upon the fact that the optical properties of neutral   molecules with one electron excited to a high Rydberg state are almost   identical to those of the corresponding ion.  The method proceeds by   preparing a neutral molecule in a high-n Rydberg state just below the   first ionization limit.  The ion cores of these Rydberg molecules are   then electronically excited by a tunable laser, resulting in   autoionization when an ion transition occurs.  The production of ions   with respect to wavelength produces spectra which are equivalent to   photoelectron spectra but are not restricted by the resolution of   electron energy analyzers.  PIRI is able to examine the excited   electronic states of ions which are not accessible to previous high   resolution threshold ionization techniques such as zero kinetic energy   electron spectroscopy and mass analyzed threshold ionization   spectroscopy.  This new technique will be applied to several small   molecules of atmospheric interest in order to explore the parameters and   capabilities of the method while gathering new information about these   important species.    Photoinduced Rydberg ionization spectroscopy or PIRI will enable the   electronic spectroscopy of molecular cations to be observed with a   resolution previously unattainable.  For the first time, rotational and   vibrational information on congested excited electronic states of ions   will be acquired.  Initial experiments will focus on ionic states of   oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide.",
