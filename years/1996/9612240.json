The microscope will be capable of imaging cells located  up to one millimeter below the surface of living tissue, even  though light scattering in the specimen would render it opaque to  a conventional or confocal light microscope. Depth penetration is  achieved by use of a near infrared superluminescent diode light  source with a coherence length of 20 um together with a coherence  gate based on a Michelson interferometer. This combination  excludes light back-scattered from out-of-focus planes, giving a  depth resolution of 10 ~m. Lateral resolution of 10 um or better  is achieved by focusing the illuminating beam down to a small  spot. Two-dimensional lateral scanning of the beam spot produces  an optical section at a fixed depth in the sample. A  three-dimensional image is obtained by stacking successive  optical sections at different depths. Such three-dimensional  scans should take less than a minute.    OCM will be used to study two key systems in developmental  biology, the frog Xenopus laevis and the plant Arabidopsis  thaliana. In the frog embryo, the processes of gastrulation and  neurulation will be monitored in real time. Specifically, the  relative motions of the surface cells (ectoderm) and deeper cells  (mesoderm) will be followed to better define the spatial  relationships between the responding and signaling cells during  interactions critical to neural patterning and to better  characterize the segmentation of the mesoderm into axial and  paraxial structures. These events occur several hundred  micrometers into the embryo, at a depth inaccessible to a  confocal microscope because of multiple scattering.    In Arabidopsis, embryo formation o ccurs deep within maternal  tissues and is therefore inaccessible to confocal microscopy. OCM  will be used to observe plant embryo development in vivo (in the  seed-containing silique) for the first time. Two specialized  embryonic tissues, the shoot and root meristems, somehow direct  the plant's subsequent embryonic and post-embryonic development.  Wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis plants will be used to study the  role of the shoot apical meristem in embryonic development.  Post-embryonically, the shoot apical meristem directs the pattern  of leaf initiation (phyllotaxy). The role of the meristem in  initiation of such patterns is hidden by overlying leaves. With  OCM it will be possible for the first time to observe in real  time the earliest morphological changes associated with  phyllotaxis. These observations of morphology will be correlated  with genetic analysis and other experimental manipulations to  probe the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying plant  development.    A collaborative team of faculty with backgrounds in biology,  biophysics, computer engineering, optical sciences, and physics  will direct the research program, with extensive participation of  undergraduate students both during the summer and throughout the  academic year. In addition to the specific research goals  described in this proposal, another key objective is to engage  undergraduates in significant research projects that will help  prepare and motivate them to pursue careers in multidisciplinary  activities in science and technology.",
