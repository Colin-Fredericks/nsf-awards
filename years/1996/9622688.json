 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, a fundamental study of the mechanisms of  matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) will be  conducted.  Although MALDI is one of the more widely used methods  for preparing large biological molecules in the gas phase for  subsequent characterization by mass spectrometry (MS), this  process remains poorly understood.  Together with this  fundamental study, efforts to optimize MALDI preparation of DNA  for MS analysis will be conducted in order to increase the  production of these large molecules in the gas phase.   Additionally, kinetic studies of large biological molecule ion  fragmentation patterns will be pursued so that reactions of DNA  and proteins with small organic and inorganic substrates can be  better understood at the molecular level.    The primary goal of this research is the elucidation of the  mechanisms of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization which  is a broadly used but poorly understood process for preparing gas  phase samples of large biological molecules for mass spectral  characterization.  Optimization of these ion-forming processes is  also an aim of the project.  Achievement of the goals of this  research will advance significantly the application of MALDI/MS  in the study of complex reactions involving large biological  molecules.",
