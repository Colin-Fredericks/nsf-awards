 "awd_abstract_narration": "Opportunities for enhancing undergraduate education in geosciences via a range of computer-based technologies are growing extremely rapidly. These opportunities include models and visualizations of processes that take place at large space and/or time scales, maps and satellite imagery, digitizers, large data bases, and software for data analysis. The objective of this proposal is to significantly improve the education we provide by increasing our capabilities to incorporate these opportunities in courses for our general education students and undergraduate majors in geology, hydrology, earth sciences, earth sciences teaching, and ultimately an emerging marine sciences curriculum. To accomplish this, we are seeking funding for the purchase of 16 personal computers that would be installed in a computer classroom and linked into the department and University networks and the Internet, along with basic software that will allow us to run the applications we have identified.",
