 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530396  Silva  Natural resources recovery, including offshore oil and gas  is the most important economic activity in the United States  Exclusive Economic Zone.  Many technical constraints must be  faced as the industry moves toward sites on the continental  slope and rise where seabed processes are complex.  The  objective of this research project is to understand the  fundamental linkages between engineering properties of slope  sediments, environmental forcing functions, and downslope  processes; and to develop the capability of predicting the  range of seabed processes.    The program is theoretical as well as an integrated  combination of field, laboratory, and modeling efforts.  A  corridor 2000m wide by 100 nm long, of the seabed in the  northwest Gulf of Mexico has been selected extending from  water depths of 1000 to 3000m.  This corridor encompasses a  wide range of seabed processes including mass wasting and  creep, faulting, diapirism, sediment flows, and related  processes such as fluid expulsion and depressions (basins)  associated with halokinesis.  The field work during the  first year entails two research cruise expeditions:  the  first to obtain detailed acoustic subbottom information and  side-scan sonar seafloor images within the corridor and the  second to obtain large-diameter undisturbed core samples to  depths of 25 to 30m subbottom and to conduct in situ  geotechnical tests.  The comprehensive laboratory testing  program focuses on determining the pertinent geotechnical  properties and parameters necessary for the  analysis/modeling portion of the research.  Essentially all  the instrumentation is available for the experimental  studies.  The laboratory program will include determination  of constitutive models to characterize the engineering  behavior of the various sediments from very slow  deformations (creep), static stress strain properties, and  flow properties.  The material models and parameters will  then be incorporated in available computer models to  charac terize and study the full range of seabed processes  that are encountered within the corridor site.  The expected  result will be the ability to predict the range of seabed  processes at work on the continental slope of the Gulf of  Mexico.  ***",
