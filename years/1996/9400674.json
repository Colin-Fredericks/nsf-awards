Successful completion of the Phase I research effort has shown that high-pressure ASJ is a feasible concept for use in underwater cutting of rocks and metals. Phase I program results demonstrated the method to be superior to previous abrasive jet techniques in submerged environments simulating up to 6,100-m (20,000-ft.) ocean depths. Extensive laboratory tests will be performed during Phase II that will result in scientific data, prediction models, and a basic understanding of the submerged material removal process by high-velocity jets. Phase III commercialization activities will include the delivery of a prototype ASJ to either the Navy or Oceaneering Technologies for field testing and demonstration. The successful development of this technology will enable the advantages of ASJ cutting to be readily adapted to platforms, remotely operated vehicles, submersibles, and manual operations.   There are a wide range of commercial and government applications for ASJ technology including cleaning and descaling; mining; exploration; underwater construction; salvage, decomissioning and removal; and pipeline repair. Use of ASJ technology in these applications will prove more economical and environmentally benign than existing underwater cutting technologies.
