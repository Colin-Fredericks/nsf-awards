The  instrument will be equipped with HTS thin film transformers  with  a micrometer-size pickup coil to couple the flux motion signal to  a  dc SQUID.  This probe will be scanned with micrometer control.  With  this  instrument the dynamics of flux line motion  will  be  investigated, especially the depinning process.  An objective  is  to  determine information about individual pinning sites  in  the  HTS   material.   This  research  may  reveal  the  main  pinning  mechanism  and  thus may lead to an improvement in  the  critical  current density in the HTS materials.  %%%  The  discovery  of  high  temperature  superconducting  materials  provides  great  potential  for applications  in  many  types  of  products.  The key problem for many practical applications is the  enhancement  of  the critical current density in magnetic  fields  that  is governed by control of magnetic flux line motion.   This  grant  supports the development of a microscopic probe to  detect  the  motion  of flux lines and determine the material  properties  such  as defects or impurities that impede or pin the flux lines.  Thus this research may lead to new techniques for the preparation  of high-current carrying superconductors.  ***",
