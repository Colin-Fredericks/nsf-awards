 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interpretation of human evolution depends upon analysis of the behavior and ecology of  several extinct hominid species.  However, the number of fossil species represented by known  specimens remains controversial, as does the assignment of many individual specimens to  particular species.  A basic unresolved problem concerns the range of diversity of individual  species: At what point are the differences between any two or more specimens sufficient to  suggest that they are from different species, as opposed to simply representing the differences  found among individuals from a single species?  Using new computer digitizing technology and three-dimensional analyses, measurements will  be taken from the facial bones of virtually all available australopithecine fossils, and  measurements of the identical facial structures will be taken on large samples of skeletal  material of modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas.  The range of variation in facial  morphology of these three modern species will be used as a basis of comparison for the ranges  of variation among australopithecine specimens.  These results will provide important insights into population structure and sexual dimorphism of  early human ancestors. The extant data will serve to both evaluate the categorization of  australpithecine specimens into species groups, as well as to establish whether or not  australopithecine species as currently defined are more or less variable than modern analogues.",
