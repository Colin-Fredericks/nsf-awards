 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Prezbinda      This project is concerned with a microlocal study of characters and matrix coefficients of irreducible unitary representations of classical Lie groups in the context of Howe's theory of real reductive dual pairs. The goal is to understand the characters, matrix coefficients and wave front sets of such representations in terms of the moment maps which occur   naturally in that theory. These are the moment maps of classical invariant theory.     The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and   number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.  The mathematical techniques, on which this particular project is based, are also useful in signal processing, data compression and cryptography.",
