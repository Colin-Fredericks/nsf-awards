 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the   Chemistry Division, Raftery will develop a magnetic resonance technique   to enhance surface signals in catalyst materials.  The technique, called   Optical Pumping Enhancement for NQR of Surfaces (OPENS), overcomes the   usual limitations of sensitivity by combining optical pumping with   nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) detection in zero magnetic field.    Surface signal enhancements of five orders of magnitude are expected   compared with normal NQR detection.  Polarization transfer from xenon   atoms to surface quadrupolar nuclei will be employed.  Detection limits   will be investigated using an isotopic nitrogen-14 compound.    Selective oxidative catalysts are used in many chemical production   processes world wide, translating into billions of dollars of commerce   annually.  Industrial applications of catalytic materials range from new   routes for the synthesis of important materials to elimination of harmful   waste by-products.  In these studies the structure of catalytic materials   will be studied using a new magnetic resonance technique in order to   learn how they function and to be able eventually to improve their   manufacture and use.  Initial materials examined will be those from   catalytic systems of practical importance, copper oxide and titanium   dioxide.",
