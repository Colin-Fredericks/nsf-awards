 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jennifer A. Griffiths has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Griffiths received the doctoral degree from   the University of California at Los Angeles under the supervision of   Professor Mostafa A. El-Sayed.  Dr. Griffiths will continue research at   the University of Massachusetts at Amherst under the sponsorship of   Professor David Tirrell.  The postdoctoral research will focus on the   immobilization of proteins and model protein systems, such as helical   polypeptide polymers, on solid surfaces.  The goal is to develop surface   bound monolayers of monodisperse helical polymer systems in which there   is 3-dimensional control of the protein conformation and assembly at the   interface through selective placement of a cysteine residue in the helix.    The helical systems utilized are cysteine analogs of polyglutamic acid   polymer generated by biological synthesis.  The work leads to new   materials and applications for biopolymeric systems in interfacial   chemistry.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
