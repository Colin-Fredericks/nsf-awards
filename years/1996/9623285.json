 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9623285 Jeffrey S. Fox University of Colorado  The project consists of three problems related to harmonic analysis and K-theory. The first problem is concerned with studying the structure of the representation ring defined by Kasparov for the general linear group over a local field. We are developing a method of \"induction\" from the representation ring of a maximal parabolic to the representation ring of the full group.  The main issue in this problem is an analytic one, involving the construction of an appropriate operator between G-representations that almost commutes , in the sense of Kasparov, with the G-action. The second problem concerns the explicit computation of multiplicity's of irreducible representations of compact groups in the kernel and cokernel of transversally elliptic differential operators. The third problem is to study the explicit decomposition of the quasi-regular representation for an algebraic solvable Lie group.  The main focus is to apply the fairly new results of Anoussis on orbital integrals for solvable Lie groups in conjunction with the Selberg trace formula.          The overall focus of this project is to use symmetry to study several complicated systems.  The notion of symmetry pervades the sciences and while it  is difficult to give a precise mathematical definition ( but such a definition does exist), we see symmetry every day. The \"squareness\" of a square or the \"roundness\" of a circle are two examples of symmetry. The reason symmetry is such an important idea is that it is systems that possess intrinsic symmetry that scientists  can analyze. The symmetry of a problem provides us with powerful tools for developing effective means of computation. As an example, one of the problems that this proposal is concerned with is finding effective means of calculating, very explicitly, the \"G- indices\" of certain differential operators: we are counting certain types of solutions of a problem where symmetry is present. This leads to the development of a type of Feynma n diagram  that incorporates both the differential operator as well as the underlying symmetries.  Feynman diagram techniques have proved to be very important both in academic science as well as applied science in industry. For example,  the General Motors Research lab outside of Detroit has mathematicians that specialize in Feynman diagram techniques, which are used to solve the mathematics behind very practical problems.",
