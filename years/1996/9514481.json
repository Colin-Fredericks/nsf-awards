 "awd_abstract_narration": "A sound pattern can be the result either of the distribution  of targets (phonology), or context-sensitive realization of  targets (phonetic implementation). Linguists have been aware of  this dichotomy for some time, but as yet there has been  relatively little work explicitly exploring the properties  distinguishing the two kinds of sound pattern.         This project will explore the two kinds of pattern as they  are displayed in fundamental frequency (fO) in the Bantu language  Chichewa, the national language of Malawi.         Extensive data on the language were collected by the P.I. in  1992-1993 in Malawi, including lexical paradigms, intonational  paradigms, and natural discourse (in the form of traditional oral  narratives). Pitch tracks of the recorded data will be produced  using computer sound analysis equipment. Measurements will be  entered into a spreadsheet and the significant factors and trends  extracted. The end result will be explicit quantitative models of  fO contours.              The project will include the collection of new data for  Chichewa, in particular:    (1) An experiment will be conducted with Chichewa speakers in the  U.S. in which alternating tone sequences are produced as  statements and as questions with systematic variation of (a)  pitch range and (b) speech rate. This will make clear the effect  of these two variables on fO, as well as clarifying the form of  downtrends in Chichewa.     (2) The researchers will collaborate with Dr. Sam Mchombo, a  linguist and Chichewa speaker, on a description of the function  of intonation in Chichewa discourse.     (3) The Chichewa natural discourse material will be analyzed and  compared to the patterns found in the experimental paradigms.  This will provide a test of the experimental findings, and reveal  other factors not included in the experimental set-up.          The project will contribute to our understanding of  intonation and its interaction with lexical tone. It will clarify  the distinction between pho nology and phonetic implementation. It  will represent the first instrumental study of intonation in a  Bantu language.",
