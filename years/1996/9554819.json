 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to improve undergraduate  controls engineering education. Students frequently have  difficulties in learning controls; it is often the first  subject in which they must use the properties of complex  variables and the fundamentals of linear algebra in a  sophisticated manner. The proposed education aids will  illustrate control system design and analysis and enable  students to quickly use the knowledge presented to them. We  will develop useful, widely available, and easily accessible  tutorials for undergraduate-level controls courses using  Matlab, a popular computation and visualization software  package, and the World Wide Web (WWW). These education aids  would be a valuable addition to the undergraduate  engineering curriculum at any university. Prototypes of  these tutorials can be viewed on the WWW at  http://www.engin.umich.edu/~tilbury/matlab_tutorial.html.  The main innovation of these education aids is their  implementation on the WWW. The tutorials will combine  explanatory text with sample Matlab commands and  illustrative plots and graphics. The outline of the  tutorials will closely follow the outline of the most  popular textbooks for undergraduate controls courses,  including modeling, Laplace transforms, time-domain and  frequency-domain relationships, root-locus methods,  frequency-domain methods, state-space methods, and digital  control. Analysis techniques such as determining the  stability and steady-state error of a control system will be  incorporated throughout the tutorials. The tutorials will  contain example problems which are  worked out in detail,  showing all of the necessary steps, and sample problems for  the students to work on  independently. For these sample  problems, several levels of hints will be included. There  are three advantages to the approach taken in this project  for teaching students how to use Matlab for control  system  design. First, the tutorials will be immediately available  to students across the country  at no cost to them. Any  student with access to both the WWW through Mosaicing or  Netscape \"3\" and to Matlab on either a personal computer  or  a workstation will be able to follow a tutorial while  running Matlab and will be able to easily switch between the  two  programs. Second, students will be able to grasp key  concepts and design techniques in a \"learn by seeing and  doing\"  manner. Commands shown in the tutorials can be  copied from the Netscape or Mosaic window and pasted into  the  Matlab command window with a simple point and click of  the mouse; there is no need for time-consuming typing and  editing. Students can immediately see the result of an  actual computation, compare it to the result shown on the  tutorial,  and quickly experiment with modifications of the  code and changes of parameters. Third, by using the  hypertext  markup language on the WWW, the proposed on-line  education aids can be highly interconnected. There will be  several paths through a tutorial which have different levels  of complexity or which emphasize different methods. By  making the education aids available on the WWW, not only  will they be easily integrated into an existing  undergraduate controls curriculum in a traditional four-year  university, but they could also be used by community  colleges, industry, and individuals for continuing  education. With the education aids which we will develop, it  will be  easy for engineers in academia and industry with  access to the WWW and who currently know some classical  control  theory to learn how to use Matlab to apply their  knowledge and to improve their skills and understanding.",
