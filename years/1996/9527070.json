 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kettler  OPP 9527070    Abstract    This award supports organic geochemical characterization of  Cretaceous-Paleogene sedimentary rocks that are expected to be  recovered during the Cape Roberts Project (CRP).  The CRP  proposes to core four 500 m holes from a fast ice drilling  platform in the Ross Sea in 1995 and 1996.  The core recovered  will be described, curated, and sampled for scientific research.  The CRP has the potential to answer significant questions  regarding the history of the West Antarctic rift system, the  development of continental ice sheets in Antarctica during the  Cretaceous and Paleogene, and the response of biota to climatic  deterioration and the development of seaways.  Organic  geochemical measurements are relevant to these issues and so are  included in the initial core characterization studies.  The work  supported here includes measurement of whole-rock carbonate  carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, and total sulfur, analysis  of the elemental composition of kerogen in selected samples, and  gas chromatographic analysis of the solvent-soluble organic  matter in selected samples.  These data will be collected in the  Crary Science and Engineering Center (CSEC) at McMurdo Station  and will be reported as part of the initial core characterization  study of the CRP.",
