Recently, we have  dramatically improved the technique of ARPES from its previous  typical resolution of ~30 meV to 8 meV.  This improvement opens  up new possibilities in understanding new materials,  particularly the man-made ones with large unit cells.  This is  because in materials with large unit cells the eclectron states  are closely spaced in energy, requiring extreme  resolution.  Examples of what we propose to study are the high temperature  and organic superconductors, quantum confinement in metallic,  magnetic, and semiconducting multilayers, etc.  Although we  have made great strides in improving the energy resolution, the  same cannot be said about momentum resolution.  The new man-  made large unit cell materials have very small Brillouin zones.  This problem is fortunately only geometrical in nature:  the  momentum resolution can be improved by simply restricting the  acceptance angle of the electron analyzer.  However, since the  counting rate decreases as the square of that aperture, higher  photon beam flux is required.  %%%  With this award we will construct an undulator-based beamline  with a high throughput-high resolution normal incidence  monochromator at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's  Synchrotron Radiation Center;s Guest Investigator Program.  The  instrument will not only open new possibilities in the study of  electronic structure, but will also relieve the heavy burden  placed on the existing 4m NIM beamline at SRC.  ***",
