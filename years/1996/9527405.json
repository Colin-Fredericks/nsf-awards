Mike Pace and I are still   working on the budget.    Bob    DEB-95-27405:  \"Do top-down and bottom-up controls interact to exclude   nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria from the plankton of estuaries?\"              Eutrophication and phytoplankton production are frequently limited  by nitrogen in estuaries and by phosphorus in lakes.  One reason for this   striking differences is a difference in nitrogen fixation.  In lakes when   nitrogen availability is low, nitrogen-fixing organisms bloom and help   alleviate the nitrogen deficit by fixing molecular nitrogen into   biologically available forms.  In most estuaries, no such response occurs.   This proposal tests the hypothesis that low availabilities of trace metals   (Fe and Mo) in estuaries relative to lakes leads to slow growth rates of   nitrogen-fixing organisms, leaving these organisms vulnerable to   consumption by animals, and thereby preventing nitrogen fixation.  In   preliminary experiments with tanks full of seawater, the investigators   successfully grew nitrogen fixing organisms by keeping animal populations   low.  This was the first time nitrogen-fixing organisms of the sort common   to lakes were found in estuarine water anywhere in North America.  The new   research will build on these tank studies to more completely test the   hypothesized difference between lakes and estuaries.",
