This construction, motivated by a purely probabilistic approach to the problem, has the potential to achieve the best possible overall rate of such approximations. In statistics, the investigator studies three different and unrelated groups of problems. One of these is concerned with the overall asymptotic normality, at the best possible rate of convergence, of certain least squares estimators for the exponent of a regularly varying tail of a distribution function, by means of the quantile-transformation method. The second is the exploration of universal large-sample Gaussian approximations to cumulative-hazard and product-limit processes under random censorship without any conditions on the estimated distribution or the censoring mechanism, where the investigator uses a combination of strong-approximation and martingale-theoretic analyses. The third group of problems is concerned with rounding off a recent theory of nonparametric curve estimation under short- and long-range dependent Gaussian subordination by answering the outstanding questions for random-design regression.   The investigator's Probability project studies an approximation to sums of independent observations, which, unlike the usual approximations in terms of bell-shaped curves-- responsible only for the middle portions of the data -- attempts to incorporate the effects of the extremes as well. In Statistics, the investigator is studying three different groups of problems. The first one is concerned with the robust estimation of measures of \"thickness of the tails\" of data sets. This problem is important in various applied statistical and actuarial situations, such as the assessment of the variability of stock-price changes and the distribution of large claims in insuran ce business, particularly in bankruptcy re-insurance. The second group of statistical problems is to investigate the basic large-sample behavior of estimation when the observed data are incomplete due to the presence of nuisance effects and/or the necessity of an early termination of data collection; situations commonly referred to as random censorship. Here the investigator's anticipated results aim at greatly stretching the limits of concrete applicability of statistical estimation techniques for survival analyses with randomly censored data. These are of great interest in medical follow-up studies and reliability engineering. In the third group of problems in Statistics, the investigator extends his recent theory to cover all major curve-estimation patterns (density estimation, fixed-design and random-design regression) with long-memory data sets. The complete theory will explore the basic distributional properties of commonly used curve-estimation methods in time series analysis when the observations may be long-range dependent, as in many typical applied problems in geophysics and hydrology.",
