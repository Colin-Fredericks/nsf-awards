 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615044  Billah  Wind-induced vibrations of flexible structures occur in  variety of practical cases ranging from tall buildings to  transmission towers.  It is well known that the response of  many structures in a direction perpendicular to the flow is  more complex since vortices are usually shed in the wake,  not only for quasi-steady (deterministic) conditions but  also in the presence of natural turbulence.  The  corresponding structural response calculations have been  fraught with difficulty since the vortex-structure  interaction mechanism is not very well understood.  A  conceptual understanding that has emerged recently is that  vortex-induced vibration is initiated due to the creation of  parametric instability condition.  the concept has received  substantial support from experimental results as well as  from  analytical calculations.  The present research  initiative will rigorously  try to validate the parametric  instability condition and its various  ramifications from  fundamental fluid-structure understanding.",
