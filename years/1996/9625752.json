 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study is concerned with a one-step direct process to fabricate  three-dimensional parts using a laser beam.  This process is referred to as the  Laser-Aided Direct Rapid Prototyping (LADRP).  Laser light can melt and/or  vaporize virtually any material and laser tooling leads to the unification of  various conventional tools because a laser beam can be used to carry out many  different machining operations such as cutting, drilling, welding and milling.   Such process integration is very important for the rapid production of three-  dimensional parts directly in near net shape.    The success of the proposed rapid prototyping process depends on the development  of systematic design methodologies and developing suitable digital interfaces  between design and manufacturing.  The proposed research will carry out  experimental studies and develop mathematical models for the LADRP process, and  will develop design rule characterization of the LADRP process so that lower-  level CAD tools for process planning simulation and verification may be  implemented.  A layered description language will be developed that can generate  the slices of 2.5 D layers for the part from an input file specified in some  higher level description language such as the STL or ACIS format.",
