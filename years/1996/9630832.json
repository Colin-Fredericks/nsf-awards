 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630832  Rudy    Nerve cells fire electrical signals, whose frequency is the  \"Morse code\" by which information is transmitted throughout  the nervous system.  Key in determining the firing frequency  of neurons are membrane proteins known as potassium  channels.  Potassium channels are also important in  the  regulation of the rhythmic contraction of the heart.  Research funded by this grant investigates the molecular  composition of one type of potassium channel known as A-  type, which is particularly important in the modulation of  the firing tempo of neurons and heart cells.  These A-type  potassium channels regulate firing frequency by periodically  changing between active and inactive states.  Previous work  has shown that the periodicity of activation of A-type  potassium channels depends on small molecules that interact  with the channel. The goal of this project is to isolate and  characterize these small components of A-type potassium  channels and identify the genes that encode them.    Results from research is expected to significantly increase  the understanding of the molecular regulation of  nervous  system function.",
