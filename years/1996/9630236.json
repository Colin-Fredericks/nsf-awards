The physiological effects of thermal  and water  variability  are  interactive, because temperature  strongly  affects  water  loss, and evaporative water loss is often a  critical  mechanism  for   preventing  overheating.   Terrestrial   invertebrates  provide  particularly valuable models for the study of the biological  effects  of  thermal  and hydric variability, due to their ecological  importance,  species  diversity,  ease of rearing, and  short  generation  times.  However, use of terrestrial invertebrates as model organisms  for  evolutionary and environmental studies ultimately depends on  a solid  understanding  of their molecular, cellular  and  organismal  physiology.  Traditionally  our  understanding of  many  aspects  of  the  cellular and  organismal  physiology  of  invertebrates  has  lagged  well  behind our  knowledge  of  vertebrates,  partly  due  to  the  focus  of  research on  biomedicine, and partly due to technical limitations imposed  by small  body sizes.  Recent advances in molecular biology, computer,  and  micro-analytical technologies have overcome  many  of  these  technical  limitations  to  the  study of invertebrates.   We  are  now  entering an era  where  rapid advances in our understanding of the  genetics,  cell  biology,  and  physiology of terrestrial  invertebrates  are  occurring.  These advances are providing information of basic importance  to  agriculture, ecology, and evolutionary biology.    This  symposium will be held at the Society for  Integrative  and  Comparative  Biology  1996  meeting,  December   27-30,   in  Albuquerque, New Mexico.  This symposium will bring together  16 scientists from a  diversity     of     fields    ranging    from     molecular  biology/biochemistry,  organismal  physiology, and evolutionary  genetics  who  are  addressing   issues  related  to the temperature and water  relations  of  terrestrial  invertebrates.   This  symposium will promote  communication  and  collaboration  among these disciplines,  with  the  goal  of  providing a  more integrated understanding of this fundamental area of  environmental physiology.  Proceedings will be published  in  American  Zoologist.",
