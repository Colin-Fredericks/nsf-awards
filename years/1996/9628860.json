 "awd_abstract_narration": "Webster, et al  9628860    Knowledge of factors regulating the uptake, retention, and cycling of nitrogen in streams is integral to understanding lotic ecosystem structure and function. Further, because streams serve as key hydrologic and biogeochemical links between upland and downstream aquatic ecosystems, understanding how changes in climate or land use will affect movement of materials across the landscape and water quality requires working models of controls on the structure and function of streams. Although there is a rich literature of process-level studies of key nitrogen transformations in streams, a robust model linking hydrodynamics, nitrogen cycling, metabolism, and food web dynamics in streams is lacking.  In this project we will use simulation modeling, field tracer additions and an intersite comparative approach to increase our understanding of controls on stream nitrogen cycling and develop a generalized model of nitrogen dynamics in lotic ecosystems. The central hypothesis we will address is:  The considerable variability among streams in uptake, retention, and cycling of nitrogen is controlled by key hydrodynamic, chemical, and metabolic characteristics that determine water retention, degree of nitrogen deficiency, and energyflow through food webs in stream ecosystems.  From this hypothesis we derive a number of specific predictions involving ammonium and nitrate uptake, food web transfer of nitrogen, and nitrogen turnover. These predictions will be tested by conducting an identical set of field experiments in each of 10 streams ranging in latitude from the tropics to the arctic and differing greatly in their hydrodynamic, chemical, and metabolic characteristics. The field experiments include: (1) short-term (several hours) injections of a conservative tracer and application of a transient storage model to define hydrodynamic characteristics, (2) short-term injections of nutrients (NH4, NO3, PO4) to determine relative uptake lengths of different nutrients and potential N defici ency, (3) whole-stream measures of gross primary productivity (GPP) and community respiration (R) to define stream metabolic characteristics, and (4) long-term (6 weeks) additions Of 'sNH4 at tracer levels to measure temporal and spatial (longitudinal) dynamics of nitrogen uptake, retention, and cycling rates through the stream ecosystem. Simulations of the 'sNH4 addition have been performed for most of the streams using a 15-compartment, stream nitrogen mass balance model. The model will be updated and rerun for all streams prior to the start of the field experiments to provide site-specific predictions of temporal and spatial distributions of '5N in the ecosystem based on current understanding. Data from the field N experiments will be used to test the site-specific model results, as well as to provide measures of N uptake, cycling, and turnover that will be used in intersite analyses to test predictions of relationships with potential controlling factors. Potential controlling  factors on N dynamics include stream hydrodynamics ( importance of transient storage zones), chemistry c~  (streamwater N concentrations and N:P ratios, detrital C:N ratios), and metabolism (GPP P:R ratios).         ??",
