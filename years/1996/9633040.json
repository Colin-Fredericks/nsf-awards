 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT 9633040  Ringo        This U.S.-Hungary research project involves Dr. John Ringo of Washington State University and Dr. Gabor Temes of Oregon State University and their Hungarian counterpart, Dr. Kalman Tarnay of the Technical University of Budapest.  Their collaborative efforts will feature improvement of design techniques for accurate high-linearity switched-capacitor circuits.    Specifically, the researchers will study the underlying problems associated with shrinking dimensions of components for CMOS switched capacitor designs.  Focus will be on determining: 1) approaches for making novel mixed-mode CMOS circuit operation less dependent on the exact characteristics of devices; 2) the influence of thermal and quantum-mechanical device effects on these circuits; 3) modeling and simulating these effects; and 4) identification of ways to minimize their influence.  The intent of this joint research is to apply the device-level results obtained at the Technical University of Budapest to the optimization of the circuits developed at Oregon State University.  Overall, results are expected to yield improved models for computer-aided circuit analysis and scaling rules.    This engineering project in solid state and microstructures research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and  share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.    ??",
