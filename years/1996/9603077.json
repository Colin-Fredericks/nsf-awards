The approach relies on  the notion that a linear polymer passing through a suitably small  channel or pore in an otherwise impermeable interface will  sequentially  modify the local properties of the pore in a manner that reflects  the sequence of monomers in the polymer. Our recent results using  model RNA and DNA polymers that were electrophoretically driven  through a protein channel in a lipid bilayer demonstrate the  promise of this approach, but are limited by the delicacy of the  organic protein-lipid interface which cannot tolerate the  denaturants and temperatures required to eliminate base pairing  and other secondary structures in  native polynucleotides. The short term goals of this proposal are  to develop a robust, inorganic interface (silicon nitride) that  will duplicate the results obtained with the organic interface  and  lead to the development of an instrument for very high speed  sizing of native polynucleotides. Accomplishing these short term  goals will demonstrate the feasibility of using a small channel  in an inorganic interface as the base on which to develop a novel  sensing device for high speed sequencing of single DNA molecules.  Because this approach eliminates several of the currently  required preparatory chemical steps in DNA sequencing, and  because it depends on inherently  rapid, molecular events, success with this method will be an  extraordinarily important advance that should reduce the time and  cost of nucleic acid sequencing by several orders of magnitude.",
