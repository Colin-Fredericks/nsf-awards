 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627171  Sadler    The Science Education Department of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics will produce and evaluate a pilot for a series of after school television program targeted at youth aged 9 -12.  The series, which is based on the research into children's misperceptions about science conducted by the applicant, will help viewers make sense of often poorly understood or misunderstood science principles.  The project will be highly interactive through the use of the Internet and 800 numbers.  In the television series, viewers will see \"evidence\" for different ways to interpret basic science concepts and will be called upon to make sense of the key evidence, conduct further investigation on their own, and register their findings via the Internet and World Wide Web or by calling an 800 number.  In response to the viewer's verdict, local stations will air either a \"guilty\" or \"innocent\" resolution -- both of which will clarify the science concept being considered.    The PI for the project will be Philip Sadler, Director of the Science Education Department at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  The Project Manager will be Matthew Schneps, Director of the Science Media Group.  Education and science content will be the responsibility of Hal Coyle, a science teacher and curriculum developer, and Roy Gould, an Education Specialist at the Center.  The principal science advisor will be Irwin Shapiro, Director of the Center for Astrophysics, and the chief educational advisor will be Charles Whitney, Prof. Emeritus Harvard University.  The video will be produced in cooperation with Terra Associates in New York.",
