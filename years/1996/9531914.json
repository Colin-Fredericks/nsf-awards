 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531914  Wang  Motivated by the high promise of block copolymers as  materials for nanotechnology, and by their intrinsic  scientific interest as model systems for self-assembling  complex fluids, a systematic program of theoretical  investigations will be undertaken on a number of topics  involving self-assembled block copolymer nanostructures  using statistical mechanical techniques.  Some of these  topics deal with phenomenologies that are expected to apply  to a large class of amphiphilic systems, while others are  unique to block copolymers.    The thermo-mechanical properties of ordered nanostructures  of block copolymers will be studied.  By including  mechanical stress or strain, a new dimension is added to the  study of self-assembling complex fluids.  Focus will be on  various thermo-mechanical instabilities and phase  transitions that occur when an ordered nanostructure is  subjected to anisotropic stress or strain.  Some of these  instabilities and transitions are unique to ordered block  copolymer nanostructures and are manifestations of length-  scale dependent ordering,i.e., fluid-like behavior on the  monomer scale and solid-like on the polymer length-scale.    Also to be studied will be kinetic pathways of order-  disorder and order-order transitions in diblock copolymers  using a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau approach.  Focus will  be on possible non-trivial intermediate states during the  various transitions after a sudden change in the system  parameters.  Of special interest will be the existence of  the so-called pseudo-stable states which correspond to  saddle points on the free energy surfaces.  These states  will be explored both dynamically and in equilibrium.    Finally, the phase behavior and nanostructures of ABC  triblock copolymers will be studied using self-consistent  field techniques.   In contrast to the better studied AB  diblocks, a fundamentally new feature here is that the  morphological structures and phase behaviors depend not only  on the fraction of ea ch block and the overall molecular  weight, but also crucially on the sequence of the blocks in  the chain and on the relative strengths of the interactions  between the three unlike pairs of blocks.  %%%  This new award is to support theoretical research on  nanostructure and phase transitions in block copolymers.  The research particularly looks at the behavior of this  important class of polymers when subjected to mechanical  forces.  In addition to providing insight into fundamental  issues in polymer physics, the results will also be useful  in applications of this class of polymers for practical use.  ***",
