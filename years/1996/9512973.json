 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ten biologists from the Departments of Zoology and Psychology of  the University of Maryland, College Park are requesting funds to  purchase a laser-scanning confocal microscope and image analysis  workstation to support and enhance their research. Drs. Mount, Payne,  Popper and Rivas will be the primary users of the instrument. Within  our multidisciplinary group, the uses of confocal microscopy include  investigations of neuronal polarity in cerebellar granule neurons (Dr.  Rivas, Co-PI on this grant), regeneration of sensory hair cells in the  ear (Drs. Dooling and Popper), the role of calcium ions in  phototransduction (Dr. Payne), the development of central auditory  projections in the CNS (Drs. Brauth, Carr, and Hall), how the correct  processing of RNA from protein-coding genes is specified in higher  organisms (Dr. Mount), homology of invertebrate auditory neurons  (Yager), and investigations of stream meiofauna (Dr. Palmer). These  laboratories have a large number of postdoctoral, graduate and advanced  undergraduate students who will use the confocal microscope during  their research training.        We are requesting a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal imaging system  coupled to a Nikon 300 inverted epi-fluorescence microscope, and a  Silicon Graphics \"Indy.\" image analysis workstation for quantitative  image analysis and three-dimensional image reconstruction. The confocal  system will include a krypton-argon laser (with emission lines at 488,  568, and 647 nm), triple dichroic beamsplitter, four detection channels  (three PMT-based detector channels and one detector for transmitted  light), and high resolution 24-bit acquisition software. This system  will allow us to image up to three separate fluorescent channels for  multi-label applications. An inverted configuration with DIC optics is  needed so that the epi-fluorescence Nikon microscope can be used for  cell cultures, and to provide ample access for micromanipulation, as is  required by several of our users.        Confocal micr oscopy will significantly enhance the research  programs of each of the core investigators, and will allow them to  pursue areas of research that have heretofore been extremely difficult  or impossible to examine with conventional microscopy. In contrast to  conventional fluorescence microscopy, in confocal microscopy  out-of-focus structures do not contribute to background because they  receive little or no illumination, and any fluorescent signal produced  by them is rejected by the instrument. Unlike conventional microscopy,  where one must physically cut a thick tissue into extremely thin  sections for imaging, the extremely shallow depth-of-field of confocal  microscopy allows the optical sectioning of either intact cells or  thick specimens (such as embryos or brain slices). Optical sections  taken at successive focal planes can be re-combined using  computer-generated techniques to produce a highly informative  three-dimensional reconstruction of an entire tissue or cellular  structure. These characteristics make this technique essential for our  multi-disciplinary studies, all of which require optical sectioning  through thick biological specimens with elimination of out-of-focus  fluorescence.        Each of the investigators in this proposal will use the optical  sectioning and quantitative capabilities of the confocal imaging  system. For example, Dr. Rivas will use the confocal to study the  development of fluorescently-labeled neurons that were implanted into  the brain. Using conventional fluorescence microscopy, out-of-focus  fluorescence from thousands of implanted neurons masks the structure of  any particular cell. Indeed, individual neurons extend through many  focal planes, allowing sharp focusing only on particular portions of  the cell. Drs. Brauth, Carr, Dooling, Hall, Popper, and Yager face  similar methodological problems as they attempt to study the complex  structure of neurons in the auditory nervous system. Dr. Mount will use  the confocal to make optical sections th rough thick Drosophila embryos,  and Dr. Palmer will use the confocal to section through invertebrate  whole mounts.        Dr. Payne will extend our use of the confocal into the area of  neuronal cell physiology. Dr. Payne will investigate a localized  light-induced elevation of intracellular calcium that is co-incident  with the electrical response of photoreceptors to light. Drs. Rivas and  Yager will also use the confocal for live neuronal imaging, using the  optical sectioning capabilities of the confocal to image  fluorescently-labeled neurons in thick brain slices or embryos. Thus,  in each area of our research, the confocal will greatly improve our  ability to study correlated structure and function.",
