The meeting integrates experts and novices from the fields of  biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, chemistry,  biochemistry, chemical engineering, biophysics, physics, and  biology in order to discuss new advances and create new  opportunities for biophotonics, which overlap with those objectives  recently identified in an NSF workshop panel which sought to  identify research opportunities for multi-disciplinary research and  education in \"Optical Science and Engineering,\" the resulting  initiative in OS&E and the National Research Council's \"Committee  on Optical Science and Engineering\" (COSE).  The goal of the  conference is to satisfy these aims by bringing together those  investigators who have a common intellectual curiosity in tissue  and tissue optics and who have a breadth of experience in the  analytical and physical sciences.  ***",
