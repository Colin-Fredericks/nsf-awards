 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multi-user biology equipment proposal requests funds to  purchase a cryostat that will be used in a variety of research projects  in the Psychology Department at University of North Carolina - Chapel  Hill. The user group consists of four faculty with active research  programs who are members of the Experimental and Biological Psychology  Program (Gallagher, Lysle, Dykstra) and the Developmental Psychology  Program (Gariepy). In addition, three of the users are members of the  Neurobiology Curriculum faculty (Gallagher, Lysle, and Dykstra). The  proposed cryostat will replace an American Optical cryostat purchased  in 1984 at a cost of $5,016, which can no longer be  serviced/maintained. The refrigeration unit of the existing cryostat  contains CFCs that do not meet current standards. Parts for this  machine also can no longer be replaced.       The new equipment will provide facilities for the continued  conduct of research projects for which the existing cryostat has been  used. In addition, the new cryostat will have the precision needed for  a number of projects for which the existing cryostat has been  inadequate. For example, when uniform section thickness is crucial for  quantitative work (e.g. using iodinated ligands) the investigators have  had to arrange for time on a cryostat in the medical school. The  purchase of a new cryostat with high precision for tissue sectioning  will allow all research to be conducted within our multi-user facility.  The proposed purchase is for a Leica 3000 cryostat with dual compressor  and motorized handwheel ($28,625) and height adjustment module  (additional $2,360). Thirty percent of the total cost will be provided  from equipment funds in the Psychology Department (see attached letter  in appendix from the Psychology Department Chair).       As described in the detailed Description of Research, the  applications for which a cryostat is needed range from standard  histological methods to molecular neurobiological research. These  latter inclu de studies using quantitative methods for in vitro  autoradiography, mapping of labelled oligonucleotides administered in  vivo and in situ hybridization histochemisty. In addition to serving  the needs of the faculty within the user group, the equipment will also  be extensively used in research training at undergraduate, graduate and  postdoctoral levels.",
