The workshop will be   structured in order to develop Phase II proposals to the Inter-American   Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) in the following themes: effects   of hydrologic regimes on biogeochemistry; greenhouse gas flux, mercury   cycling and food web performance, UV-dissolved organic carbon interactions   and UV effects on aquatic ecosystem structure and function; direct effects of   atmospheric chemical changes on aquatic ecosystem structure and function and   food web performance; and ecosystem effects of interannual climate   variability and effects of El Ni=F1o-Southern Oscillatio= n  events.  It is anticipated that the Phase II proposals that result from   this workshop will extend ongoing activities at the sites to expand the   research questions being addressed and to optimize training and education   opportunities for international graduate students and researchers, endorse   new global change experiments to be conducted at the Canadian sites or   elsewhere in the hemisphere, and identify and evaluate the utility of   long-term (2 or more ENSO events) data sets, including paleoclimatological   data sets which can be analyzed for insight into future ecosystem   interactions.  There is growing consensus that significant changes are occurring in the   earth's atmosphere and that these changes if unabated would lead to   significant changes in the earth's ecosystems.  The effects of these   atmospheric changes in ecosystems are more difficult to detect and can be   buried in the complex dynamics that are characteristic of even unstressed   ecosystems.  The c hallenge that this proposal accepts is to predict the   ecosystem and societal consequences of these atmospheric changes and to   detect ecosystem changes as early as possible by using the most powerful   research approaches available to ecosystem scientists.  These approaches   are whole system experimentation and time series analysis of ecosystems in   relatively remote areas, where they are only responding to the changing   atmosphere.  %%%  This proposal is for a workshop which is intended to overcome major   constraints on global change research on inland waters:  the need for   international cooperation to achieve effective research planning and   collaboration on field experiments, the need to conduct thorough and   geographically extensive database analyses, and the need to formulate and   execute hypothesis-driven comparative studies.

The workshop venues provide ecologically stimulat ing and contrasting   environments from both a natural and scientific perspective.  The   Experimental Lake Area Research Station (ELA) near Kenora, Ontario, is   located along a drainage divide at a relatively high elevation.  The area   abounds with exceptionally deep, extremely oligotrophic, headwater lakes   and scattered peatlands with some of the lowest dissolved inorganic carbon   concentrations recorded. The area is a wilderness which has resisted   settlement by humans and has therefore escaped most of the environmental   insults common to lakes and wetland worldwide.  These characteristic have   made the lakes ideal experimental systems in service to aquatic science as   well as insuring that the natural lakes are responding only to global   atmospheric changes rather than local impacts.  In addition, current global circulation models and linked ecozone models   forecast a future as dynamic as the past with serious consequences for   these well studied sites and surrounding regions in Central Canada.  The   known meteorological and geological records of the area indicate a strong   positive correlation between air temperature and increasing aridity, and   the 25 year integrated ecosystem monitoring at the ELA clearly established   that the boreal ecosystems will respond strongly to even short time   climatic fluctuation.  It has been demonstrated that there is potential to   gain from the ELA lakes positive feedback interactions among concurrent   changes in atmospheric acidity, UV, and increasing aridity.  The following countries are participating in the coordination of this   proposal:  Canada and the United States.  These countries are Members   States of the IAI, a U.S. initiative to stimulate cooperative research on   global change issues among the scientific institutions of the Americas.   The U.S. National Science Foundation is the U.S. Government agency   designated to carry out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.  ***        --========================_13392204==_--",
