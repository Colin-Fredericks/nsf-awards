 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most fundamental questions in the field of  statistical mechanics is to explain the observed increase of a  system's entropy in an irreversible process in terms of the  underlying microscopic dynamics of the constituent particles.  Recent work in dynamical systems theory (often called `chaos`  theory) has allowed for considerable progress in this direction  and for quantitative predictions to be made for both the  quantities that describe the irreversible behavior of the system,  such as transport coefficients, as well as the quantities that  describe the system's chaotic behavior, such as Lyapunov  exponents and dynamical `entropies`.  The purpose of this  research is to apply techniques of statistical mechanics to  calculate both transport and dynamical quantities for systems of  physical interest, and to relate them to each other and, in some  cases, to the thermodynamic properties of the system.  This will  lead to a deeper understanding of the connections between the  Second Law and microscopic dynamics.  For quantum systems, this  will also lead to further understanding of the behavior of some  solid state devices of considerable current interest.",
