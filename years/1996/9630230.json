Studies in a variety of taxa show  that females attend to acoustic, visual, or chemical cues  when evaluating mates.  Although males can possess suites of  traits that influence their attractiveness to females,  most  studies, however, examine female preferences for single  traits.  This leaves unresolved the issue as to what role  female preferences play in maintaining suites of traits.  Do  female s exert preferences that determine the extent to  which male traits are correlated?  Or, alternatively, do  females prefer a single or perhaps a few male traits, and  the resultant constellation of traits is due to various  factors that constrain the presence of male traits?  For  example, if female were to prefer longer males with no  attention to overall body mass, this preference would result  in them mating preferentially with longer and heavier males  since body length and body mass are usually correlated.     It has been difficult to ascertain female preferences for  multiple traits in the visual domain because technology has  not been available to easily animate and morph traits from  one male onto another.  We will utilize recent advances in  video technology that will allow us to determine the role of  female preferences in explaining the degree of correlation  of male body sexes, sword length, and complex courtship  behavior in three species of swordtail fishes.  These  studies promise to provide insights into the general  question as to how and why the sexes differ as they do",
