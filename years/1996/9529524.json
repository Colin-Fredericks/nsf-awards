Claremont Graduate School, Claremont CA    CISE Research Instrumentation:  Investigation of ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) Networks    The ARC is a Southern California consortium investigating ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) for suitability as a high speed networking technology for advanced applications such as medicine, teleconferencing, and metacomputing.  ATM service is being provided by Pacific Bell and GTE, while the local premise equipment, switches and workstations, is being provided by each ARC member.  Using the ATM equipment provided by the CISE grant, experiments in the areas of remote learning, network management, and performance evaluation will be performed by HMC and CGS.  In the area of remote learning the ARC network will be used to support real-time interactive courses and seminars between HMC and CGS and other ARC members.  During such sessions ARC network performance and management will be investigated by HMC and CGS researchers.  Because of the high speed nature of ATM, new paradigms for performance and management will be developed by ARC researchers.  A primary goal of the research conducted by HMC and CGS will investigate through experiments the suitability of ATM for supporting advanced network applications. Without NSF support for an ATM switch and workstation, Harvey Mudd College and the Claremont Graduate School would be unable to participate actively in ARC activities.",
