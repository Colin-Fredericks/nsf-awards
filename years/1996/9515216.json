 "awd_abstract_narration": "9515216  Goldin    This project examines the rise of secondary schools -- the most  important educational advance for much of the 20th century, and  the economic consequences of rapid educational change --  including productivity and wage-structure shifts.  It addresses  why education increased and what role was played by the public  sector.  Questions studied include: Did the wage structure always  widen with new technologies, and how did it respond to increased  supplied of educated labor?  Did secondary schools diffuse evenly  across the states or did some embrace the movement decades  earlier?  Did the areas with more progressive education reap  returns from their public-sector investments because local spill-  over effects were greater in the past?  What was the growth of  the educational stock and how did it impact economic growth over  the past century?  A theme running through the project is the  importance of egalitarianism in expanding education and its  reinforcing nature in society and the economy.    Of special interest is the new educational-flow data that will be  created by this project.  The 1940 census was the first to  inquire about the education of Americans, but the responses of  the older cohorts have been questioned for some time.  This  project creates corrected estimates of the human capital stock by  building them up from the flow data and then using them to revise  some well-know estimates of the role of human capital in economic  growth.  Preliminary work suggests that these new data series are  often vastly different from those derived from the 1940 census  and this indicates that education's role in economic growth may  have been larger than previously thought.",
