 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program will help the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State   University purchase an electrospray probe and associated liquid   chromatography sample introduction accessories for a Fisons/VG Quattro-SQ   mass spectrometer, which will be used in research.  The research activity   to be supported includes:(1) mechanisms of DNA crosslinking by the   anti-tumor antibiotics, (2) mechanistic studies of nucleic acid damage,   (3) the association between polyelectrolytes and lyotropic liquid   crystals, (4) characterization of iridoid and other glycosides isolated   from medicinal plants, (5) the synthesis and physical studies of   so-called supramolecular assemblies, (6) identification of the fragile   polychalcogenide anions in solution, and (7) the characterization and   estimation of purity of fluorinated carborane anions.  Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural   details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of   organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules.  The addition of the   technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic   acid molecular weights far beyond those accessible by any other   technique.  The use of electrospray ionization in combination with high   resolution provides the latest techniques available in mass spectrometry.    It affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the   characterization of compounds.  The acquisition of this capability in   mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier research   in many fields of chemistry.",
