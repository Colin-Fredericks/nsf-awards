 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9630635  Martin        The goal of this research is to gain a detailed understanding of pathogen recognition and signal transduction events involved in plant disease resistance.  Two experimental systems in tomato are being studied, resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  (causative agent of bacterial speck disease) conferred by the Pto gene and sensitivity to the fenthion insecticide conferred by the Fen gene.  The Pto and Fen genes are members of a small gene family encoding closely related serine/threonine protein kinases.  In the proposed research several genes that have been shown to encode proteins that physically interact with the Pto kinase will be characterized.  These proteins will be examined using biochemical techniques and transgenic approaches.  In addition, genes will be identified which are regulated by the Pto and Fen kinases, and they will used to examine the pathways whereby plants defend themselves from pathogens.  These studies will aid in our understanding of the molecular basis of recognition and signal transduction events involved in plant defense against pathogens.              ***",
