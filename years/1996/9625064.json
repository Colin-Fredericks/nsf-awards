 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the research is to establish a unified   framework for addressing timeliness and dependability requirements for   ATM networks.  Central to the proposed research is the virtual   path/virtual circuit (VP/VC) concept in ATM networks.  Based on the   VP/VC concept, this project considers how to 1) equip ATM networks with   fault tolerant capability by designing a fast restoration mechanism; and   2) provide ATM network users with the real-time QoS guarantees by   devising a VC route selection scheme.  In the context of designing a   fast restoration mechanism, work will focus on 1) selecting at system   initialization, for each primary VP, a backup VP (to which the traffic   on the primary VP will be switched upon node/link failure) and 2)   dynamically relocating routes for second-generation backup VPs or backup   VPs that traverse the failed node/link upon failure.  In the context of   establishing VCs with real-time QoS requirements through a variable   number of VPs, work will focus on 1) establishing a formal basis for   testing, for each selected VC route (i.e., a sequence of Vps) if there   is sufficient bandwidth on each VP on the route to meet the   user-specified end-to-end delay requirements; and 2) elaborating on   possible approaches to identifying a VC route which traverses a minimum   number of VPs among all possible routes with sufficient bandwidth. All   the component schemes proposed will be coherently incorporated into the   VP layer of the ATM traffic control architecture.  In conjunction with   the research, the PI will incorporate the research and software   implementation into teaching.",
