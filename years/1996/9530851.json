 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-30851  Azam  This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux  Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1) a better  understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic and  inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the physical,  ecological and biogeochemical factors and processes which  regulate the magnitude and variability of these fluxes, and (3)  placing these fluxes into the context of the contemporary global  carbon cycle.    This research will investigate the role and quantitative  importance of bacteria in the transformation of organic matter as  part of the JGOFS Southern Ocean Process Study.  Researchers  hypothesize that extreme seasonal and spatial variation in the  Southern Ocean leads to transient uncoupling between bacteria and  primary producers as mediated through the dissolved organic  matter pool.  The principal goal of the research will be  comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of core measurements  (bacterial abundance, biomass, and production).  This will allow  an integrated quantitative assessment of the fraction of primary  production consumed by bacteria.  Equally important is the study  of the mechanisms controlling the rate and time frame in which  primary production is processed by bacteria.  This is critical to  complement the core measurements and address these issues.  Specifically, total bacteria counts will be complemented with  counts of nucleoid-containing cells and respiring cells to  determine the fraction of the bacterial assemblage that is  active.  Incubation experiments in collaboration with other  researchers will examine variation in DOM lability and the growth  yield of bacteria.  This project will provide a quantitative and  mechanistic understanding of variability in a major pathway of  carbon flow, the microbial loop, in the Southern Ocean.",
