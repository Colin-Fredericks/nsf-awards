 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Mississippi State University acquire an automated X-ray   diffractometer system with an additional computer for structural solutions, specifically, a  Siemens P4 four -circle instrument and a Silicon Graphics Iris computer. This equipment will  enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1) structural determinants of the  energetics of carbon-cobalt bond homolysis in alkyl-cobalamins, (2) reactivity of ditungsten  (II,II) carboxylates, (3) studies of the pi-coordination of alkynes and nitriles to multiply bonded  ditungsten compounds, (4) structural and stereochemical assignments in the synthesis of  triarylmethanes, discorhabdin D, and staurosporine analogs, (5) structural studies of mono- and  bi-metallic complexes of 1,2-diethenyl cyclopentadienyl and 1,2-diethenylbenzene ligands, (6)  design and synthesis of binuclear manganese complexes for use as oxidation catalysts, and (7)  synthesis and properties of 1,2,3,5-benzothiatriazine- 1,1-dioxides,2,3-dihydro-1,2,3,5-  benzothiatriazepine 1,1-dioxides, and their tautomers and identification of the structure of  homogeneous catalysts.      The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full three  dimensional structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of all the  bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information about the  spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.This award from the  Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program will assist the Department of  Chemistry at Syracuse University acquire a modern single crystal X-ray diffraction system. This  equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1)metal oxide  clusters and solid, (2) boron hydride clusters, (3) metal-thiolate chemistry, (4) alkaline,alkaline-  earth and lanth anide chemistry, and (5) the development of technetium and rhenium  radiopharmaceuticals.       The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full three  dimensional structure of a molecule.
