 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses seismic performance of a special moment frame (SMF) system with precast SRC columns and composite steel beams.  The proposed framing system is composed of precast SRC column trees with strong connection to steel beam stubs.  The center portion of the composite steel beam is then field spliced.  The spliced location is the designated energy dissipative region, which can be in the form of either conventional beam plastic hinging or some mechanical energy dissipation devices.  The selection of this type of composite framing system and their potential for popular use in the United States system are based on two main reasons.  First, SRC columns with composite steel beam construction has been accepted by design engineers for tall buildings in low to moderate seismic regions-column steel shape is for structural use as well as for erection purposes.  Second, based on the poor performance of connections in steel SMFs during the 1994 Northridge earthquake, it is highly desirable to move the plastic hinge away from the column face.  Several issues remain to be resolved and verified, however, before seismic design guidelines can be developed.  These include the seismic performance of SRC columns with strong connections and beam spliced bending in the strong or weak axis of the column.  The ability to predict the frame's seismic response also remains to be established.  The work under this project includes the design, per 1994 UBC or NEHRP Seismic Provisions of a 12-story prototype building with perimeter composite SMFs.  Two full-scale subassemblies, including exterior and interior beam-to-column joints, respectively, will be tested cyclically in a quasistatic manner.  Analytical studies of the seismic response of test models will also be conducted.  This is a 2nd-year award under the No. 94-154 initiative `Composite and Hybrid Structures.`",
