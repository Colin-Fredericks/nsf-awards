 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding to conduct a pilot study to establish the operational feasibility of an International Regimes Database (IRD), a large scale computerized information system under development in cooperation with IIASA (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis).   This database will allow analysts to conduct systematic quantitative and qualitative studies answering a wide range of questions about the role of international regimes in environmental issue areas.  Ultimately, the generalization of this database will allow social scientists to formulate answers to major questions about international regimes:  Do they matter?  What conditions control the formation of regimes?  Why are some regimes more effective than others?       The project staff will create both paper and computerized data forms as well as instruction guidelines for the use of the protocol codes.  Twelve to 24 cases will be coded during the grant period.  This project falls within the scope of the Human Dimensions of Global Change initiative.  It will be jointly funded by the a grant from the TransCoop Program of the German-American Academic Council Foundation.",
