 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been argued that competition between jurisdictions for  citizens would lead to efficient provision of public goods on the  local level.  One of the persistent questions in the subsequent  literature concerns the properties of these efficient juris-  dictions.  In particular, it has been shown that if agents care  only about the number of citizens in a jurisdiction and not about  their types, then efficient jurisdictions will be  taste-homogeneous in the sense that agents will choose  jurisdictions containing only agents whose tastes agree with  their own.  An example of this type of nondifferentiated crowding  is a swimming pool in which only the total number of bodies in  the pool affect an agent's enjoyment of the facility.  When  crowding is differentiated, on the other hand, mixing of  different types may be optimal.  Differentiated crowding means  that agents care not only about the number of agents with whom  they share, but also about their types.  For example, the utility  an agent gets from attending a dance depends on both the ratio of  men to women, and the total number of people in attendance.  The  question of whether or not optimal jurisdictions are  taste-homogeneous has important policy implications.  It tells  us, for example, if we should have suburbs with only one type of  house, or schools that cater only to a particular type of  student.    The purpose of this research is to study this questiol in the  context of the \"crowding types\" model of local public goods.  The  crowding types model is a generalization of the differentiated  crowding model in which a distinction is made between the  crowding effects and the tastes of an agent.  This innovation  allows many new results to be obtained.   This study focuses on  three points.  First to show that when crowding and taste types  have values which are \"independent\" in the sense that the utility  wages an agent receives in the core can be hedonically decomposed  into separate wages for each of these traits, the core will  be  taste-homogeneous.  Second, to show that \"independence\" is  nongeneric in a mathematical sense.  Finally, to show that when  agents can choose their own crowding type (choosing their  profession, for example), market interactions will nevertheless  guarantee that independence is satisfied, and efficient  jurisdictions will therefore be taste-homogeneous.",
