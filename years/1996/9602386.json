The objective of the Maricopa Mathematics ATE 2000 (MMATE 2000) Project is to close the gap between what is taught and what students need for the workplace, and to continually close that gap by applying continuous improvement methodologies. The Project will engage community college and university faculty from mathematics and related disciplines and representatives from 12 semiconductor manufacturing industries in the Phoenix area, collaborating to develop course materials for 8 modules (15 class hours each) that emphasize how mathematics is used in the high-performance workplace. Through mini-internships in industry and MMATE 2000 workshops, faculty will increase their awareness of how mathematics is used in an advanced technology environment and will learn how to use the course materials in the classroom. Faculty will work with industry on a continual basis to review the mathematics content of the curriculum and maintain the currency of the applications that drive the course materials. The materials will be disseminated through a publisher with a national sales force. The target audience is all mathematics students who take courses below college algebra, especially those preparing for jobs as technicians in an advanced technology workplace. MMATE 2000 will improve the quality of the human resource base for advanced technology industries by significantly improving the way technicians are educated in mathematics.",
