The U.S. investigators, Edward Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz, propose to collaborate with Claude Kirchner and Michael Rusinowitz at INRIA/Lorraine and with other researchers at the University of Nancy and the French Center for Research in Informatics at Nancy.  Their research deals with problems in term rewriting and search techniques and in solutions of constraint and search algorithms.    The  U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in algorithms and equational reasoning.  This is complemented by the French investigators' expertise in programming languages, constraint-based reasoning, and term rewriting techniques.  The problems under study have important applications in image processing, programming languages, and automated deduction.",
