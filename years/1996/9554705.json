 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal involves the offering of a program for facilitating  and enhancing the teaching in engineering and technology of the  relatively new fields of fiber optic sensors and smart structures.   This program is intended to give undergraduate faculty a chance to  explore these technologies where teaching loads and institutional  resources have prevented such exploration in the past.  The goals  of the program are:  1) to introduce primarily undergraduate  faculty members in the various engineering and technology  disciplines to these technologies through both discussion and  practice, 2) to allow these faculty to consider and discuss how to  include the study of these technologies in their courses and  laboratories, and 3) to collect and distribute participants'  experiences in the teaching of these technologies.  Theory,  application, and hands-on exposure will be provided during the  workshop, with specific attention paid to sensors of major interest  in engineering, such as force/strain sensors, gyroscopes,  electromagnetic sensors and chemical sensors.  The program consists  of a series of participation events; a summer workshop wherein the  technologies will be introduced both technically and in terms of  educational applications; enhanced interaction over the following  year among the participants for the exchange of ideas and  preliminary results; and a follow-up workshop for the exchanges of  experiences of program participants, as well as updates on the  technologies.  In addition, formal dissemination of results will be  achieved through appropriate publications and workshop  presentations.",
