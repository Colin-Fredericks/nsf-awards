 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for a series of discussions at academic institutions  and a national meeting in Washington to illuminate the major  sources of stress affecting the academic research and education  community in the sciences and engineering, and to provoke debate on  constructive approaches to change.  This project builds on the  experience a similar project carried out in 1993-1994 by expanding  the initial campus-based dialogues to a wider array of institutions  and addressing some new issues.  This second phase of the study has  three objectives: to catalyze discussion and change on campuses; to  encourage national dialogue among all parties with interests in the  academic enterprise; and, to revive or recast the compact between  the federal government and universities.  As in the previous study,  a report will be issued and widely disseminated to colleges and  universities and other stakeholders jointly by the National Science  Board and the Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable.   This report will serve as a record of the insights and proposals of  the project participants, and it will enumerate activities or \"best  practices\" that have proven to be useful in resolving outstanding  concerns.",
