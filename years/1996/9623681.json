 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623681  Feller    This  project will involve at least fifteen Coe College  undergraduates in  a number of projects in glass science.  The purpose of the research is  to  find  relationships  between  the  atomic-level  structure  of important  glasses, some never described before and some of commercial  interest, and the physical properties exhibited by these  glasses.  The short-range   atomic  structure  will  be  determined  using   various techniques,  including magnetic  resonance, optical  spectroscopy,  and neutron  scattering.  The physical properties to  be  related  to  the atomic  arrangements include density, optical transmission,  softening temperature,  and glass-forming limits. An  important  aspect  of  this research, which will benefit and  provide additional research  training for  the undergraduate  students concerned, is the experience they will gain  in  working  as  part  of  an ongoing  and  large  international  collaboration established to study these glasses.    %%%    This research will involve the determination of quantitative  structureproperty  relationships  in  a  wide  variety  of  basic,  novel,  and commercially  interesting  glass  systems. The  glass  families  to  be studied     include  alkali   borates,   alkali   silicates,    alkali  borosilicates, alkali germanates, heavy metal oxide glasses  based  on lead  and  bismuth  oxides, alkali vanadates,  phosphates,  chlorinated glasses and others. A number of  complementary spectroscopic techniques including  novel  nuclear magnetic resonance, dynamic angle  spinning, nuclear  quadrupole resonance, elastic and inelastic neutron  scattering at  the Rutherford-Appleton lab, infra-red, and  Raman scattering  will be  used.   The  physical properties  to be examined include:  density, glass  transition  temperature, optical characterization,  and  glassformation  limits.  The  work  is part of well-established  world-wide  collaborations.  Another crucial aspect of the project  is  the  heavy reliance on unde rgraduates; at least fifteen  students from Coe College will be active as full members of  this research effort.  ***",
