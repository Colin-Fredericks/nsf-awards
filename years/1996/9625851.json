 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625851  Donahue    With this award, we will carry out a comprehensive research  program to develop x-ray microbeam diffraction and direct  imaging techniques based on Bragg-Fresnel optics.  The two  main objectives of our development effort are: 1.) to  develop high quality Bragg-Fresnel optics by employing the  state of the art nanofabrication technologies and thorough  theoretical investigation of the optical properties of Bragg-  Fresnel lenses (BFL) by computer simulation, with an  ultimate goal of producing BFLs with - 50 nm resolution; and  2.) to develop experimental methods for effectively  utilizing BFLs in a broad array of x-ray analytical methods  widely used in advanced materials and biological research,  including x-ray diffraction (e.g., small and macro-molecular  crystallography), small angle scattering, nanometer  resolution hard x-ray imaging (tomography and microscopy),  and nanostructure characterization of electronic materials.  By the first year, we will fabricate linear and circular  BFLs; during the second year we will design and begin  construction of a BFL based x-ray transmission microscope.  In the third year we will develop a BFL-based  microfluoresence microscope for elemental characterization.  %%%  We are in a strong position to undertake the development of  Bragg-Fresnel optics at the University of California, Santa  Barbara.  We have access to the unique combination of  resources essential to a BFO development program:  state of  the art x-ray facilities (including access to synchrotron  beamlines) for characterizing BFLs and submicron to  nanometer microelectronics fabrication facilities  (particularly Electron Beam Lithography and reactive ion  etching capabilities) for producing the BFLs.  These  resources are available to us on campus through two NSF  supported research centers: the Materials Research  Laboratory (MRL) x-ray facility and the Nanotech, the UCSB  branch of the National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN).  ***",
