 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate engineering majors need to develop a better understanding of processing effects on microstructure and the properties of engineering materials. Therefore, the two objectives of the proposed laboratory improvement are (1) to develop a better understanding of the properties-structure-processing triad for engineers and (2) to prepare students in engineering and the sciences to be intelligent users or consumers of electron optical techniques. For the first objective, the scanning electron microscope may facilitate term projects in the upper-level metallurgy and manufacturing processes courses, which require students to understand the relationships among materials, design performance, and manufacturing processes. The department has begun to equip the metallurgical laboratory for this type of project, but more thorough evaluations of fracture surfaces and fine scale morphology of the phases present are required. For the second objective, hands-on experiences enable engineering and science students to recognize the appropriate capabilities of analytical tools. The development of the materials in design exercise and manufacturing sequence projects can be reported in papers and proceedings of the American Society of Engineering Education. Also, students continue to participate in project work under the sponsorship of the Steel Founders' Society of America, which is disseminated in their technical reports series with student co-authors.",
