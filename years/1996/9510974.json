 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to expand the knowledge of the  sources of technological change by examining patterns in the  location of invention in the U.S. manufacturing sector between  1870 and 1929, a period of integration of national product  markets as well as of radical change in technology and industrial  structure.  Location will be analyzed in two different senses.   The first is geographical.  Despite the frequent references to  cases such as machinery in nineteenth-century New England and  semi-conductors and computers in today's Silicon Valley, the  geographic clustering of inventive activity has received little  in the way of systematic investigation.  The core issues are:  whether such centers of invention have been common and persistent  and what conditions or behaviors gave rise to them if they were;  whether there were local externalities in invention, and if so,  whether they pertained only to a certain class of industries or a  certain stage in an industry's development; whether geographic  clustering in production has been systematically associated with  geographic clustering in invention; and whether firms located in  production clusters have been systematically associated with  geographic clustering in invention; and whether firms located in  production clusters have manifested higher rates of productivity  than those that were more isolated.    The second aspect of the locational question is organizational.   It is conventional to think of invention as an activity that  occurs within the bounds of firms, but at various times in  various industries firms have bought or licensed much of their  technology from outside suppliers, and inventors in turn have  chosen to extract their returns by selling off or licensing their  inventions.  A goal of this project is to measure the extent of  this market for technology and to explore how it widened and  deepened over time, how its mechanisms of exchange evolved, and  the nature of the institutions that mediated between inventors   and those interested in developing and commercializing new  technologies.  Another goal is to understand changes in the  extent to which inventive activity was located within the firms  that used the technology.  Finally, the interaction of the  organizational factors and geographical clustering of invention  will be analyzed.",
