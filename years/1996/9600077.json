 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600077  Zhong-Jin Ruan    The investigator's research area is in operator spaces and their applications  to operator algebras, non-commutative harmonic analysis and locally compact  quantum groups.  Recently, using operator space theory, the investigator has  studied various amenability conditions for Kac algebras and locally compact  quantum groups. During next three years, he plans to continue his research  in this direction and plans to investigate the following problems:  (1)  Operator amenability, strong Voiculescu amenability and Voiculescu       amenability for Kac algebras;  (2)  Weak amenability,  approximation property and weak approximation       property for Kac algebras, and their connection with C*-algebra and       von Neumann algebra properties;  (3)  Locally compact quantum groups.      The most profound distinction between classical and quantum mechanics is  Heisenberg's principle: one must represent the basic variables of physics  by operators rather than functions.  Motivated by Heisenberg's principle,  mathematicians have investigated the quantization of certain areas of  mathematics such as topology, differential geometry, analysis, probability  and etc.  An operator space is defined to be a subspace of operators on  a Hilbert space together with a distinct matrix norm.  Operator spaces are  natural quantization of function spaces, or more precisely, natural quantization  of Banach spaces. The theory of operator spaces was first introduced by William  Arveson in 1969. It has been quickly developed into a subarea in modern  analysis due to the recent work of David Blecher, Edward G. Effros, Vern Paulsen,  Gilles Pisier and the investigator. The theory has been proved to be extremely  useful in the study of non-self adjoint operator algebras, C*-algebras, von  Neumann algebras, non-commutative harmonic analysis, locally compact quantum  group, and etc. In this project, the investigator plans to pursue the further  properties and applications of operator spaces.  The succes s of this project  will be very helpful for us to have a better understanding of the quantized  mathematics.",
