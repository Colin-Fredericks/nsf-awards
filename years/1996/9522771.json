 "awd_abstract_narration": "In transmission electron microscopy of biological  structures, there are two phenomena that often prevent  imaging at the molecular level: radiation damage and  contamination. These problems can be reduced by two  approaches: protecting the specimen and/or improving the  microscope.      In the first approach, significant progress has been  achieved. Firstly, a special apparatus has been developed  for rapid cryoimmobilization of a living cell during light  microscopic observation for further imaging as this cell's  cryo-whole-mount. Cellular architecture is retained at the  molecular level and therefore can be referred directly to  the behavior of the living cell (Malecki 1992, Proc. EMSA  50: 566-567. Secondly, the deep negative staining/ embedding  procedure has been developed. A thick and uniform layer of  embedment supports and protects the three-dimensional  structure within the whole-mount. This electron-dense  preparation is only transparent for electrons with high  energies attainable at high accelerating voltages  (Ris&Malecki 1993, J. Struct. Biol. 111:148-157).      In this project, as the second approach, the aim is to  improve the microscope for work with beam-sensitive  specimens maintained at low temperatures. The high voltage  transmission electron microscope operating at the  accelerating voltage lMeV is used. It is already known that  high accelerating voltage is a major factor in reducing beam  damage. Therefore, benefiting from this unique high  accelerating voltage feature and on the basis of preliminary  results, four modifications are proposed: (1) addition of an  improved cryo-stage to reduce thermal drift and to damp  mechanical vibrations; (2) development of new double-blade  and cylindrical cold traps to shield the specimen; (3)  replacement of diffusion pumps for the specimen chamber and  the film camera with turbomolecular pumps to obtain a  cleaner vacuum, and (4) addition of a computer and an  intensified charge-coupled device camera to pursue real-time  image pro cessing at low doses, including real-time  three-dimensional imaging via the HEVEM.      These new capabilities of the high voltage transmission  electron microscope will be essential to pursue three  leading projects: (a) study of the functional ultrastructure  of the nucleopore complex in nucleus/cytoplasm transport,  (b) study of the role played by titin gene expression in  myofibril assembly and myoblast maturation, and (c) study of  the effects of the forced expression of myoD, myogenin, and  titin genes on induced differentiation, thus reduction of  malignancy in rhabdomyosarcomas.",
