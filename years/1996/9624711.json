 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research plan pursues the development of a unifying  framework for reasoning about execution, compilation, and  optimization of programs. The goal is to provide the  programmer, compiler writer, and implementor with an  abstract laboratory in which to investigate the interplay  among various techniques and to reason about their  correctness and efficiency with respect to both time and  space. Specifically, the aim is to formalize an evaluator, a  compiler, an optimizer, and a parser as a rewriting process.  This requires enhancing current rewriting technology with  the ability to deal with graph structures, including cyclic  and disconnected graphs. This is important since graphs are  ubiquitous in a program development system.  They occur at  the source level, after parsing, in the intermediate program  representation and during program execution.    A rigorous study of graphs is thus fundamental for reasoning  about both run-time and compile-time issues. The rewriting  technology will be enhanced further by associating  priorities and conditions to the rules. This will allow us  to directly analyze the impact of different application  schemes on efficiency. Both strict and nonstrict languages  will be considered, and also their extensions to handle  state.    The development of the abstract framework addressed in this  CAREER research project is also important for educational  purposes, since it provides a simple yet rigorous, basis for  introducing students to concepts, practical issues and, at  the same time, to formal reasoning about properties of  programs without having to introduce complex mathematical  machinery. A strong, formal background is important  regardless of whether a student is seeking higher degrees or  immediate employment. The proposed research will allow an  integration across the undergraduate language-compilation  implementation sequence, establishing a connection between  abstraction and application. Exposure of students to  research is planned through collaborat ions with other  institutions and student exchanges, which can serve to  encourage students to consider advanced education and  research careers.    This study constitutes a first step towards providing  automatically generated tools, such as optimizing compilers.  Moreover, through use of the results of the proposed  research in the classroom, their value as a tool for  introducing and reasoning about language issues can better  be evaluated.  ***",
