 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Robison (1739-1805) was a professor of natural philosophy (i.e., physics) at the University  of Edinburgh.  In his career Professor Robison was deeply involved in several major events in  the history of science and technology, including development of the steam engine and  breakthroughs in the science of chemistry.  He also shaped his home discipline, physics, in ways  that lay the foundation for revolutionary scientific developments in the nineteenth century.  For  all this, there has been no extensive historical study of Robison.  Using original manuscript  sources, the present study will remedy this oversight, thereby illuminating the connection  between conceptual aspects of scienec and a person's national and institutional position.  The  results will be incorporated into a book, provisionally titled Natural Philosophy in the Scottish  Enlightenment.",
