Tripathi, Chair, Department of Computer  Science, University of Maryland and Pankaj Jalote, Dept. of  Computer Science, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur.  This project addresses a number of design and analysis issues  relating to replicated systems.  Its basic goal is to enable the  designer to analyze replicated systems for the purpose of  predicting performance and tuning them to obtain the highest  availability.  The most important issues include: availability  analysis, the effect of parameters such as degree of replication  and node/network reliability, parameters to maximize system   availability, and preferred protocols.    Scope:  Considering the growing need for computer systems that  offer high availability, this research is timely and has broad  application potential.  The P.I.s have complementary expertise in  two areas critical for the research.  Jalote is internationally  known in fault-tolerance and software engineering.  Tripathi is  an accomplished computer scientist and well known for his work in  performance evaluation.  Computer science is an area of   exceptional strength in India and the IIT Kanpur one of the top  research institutions in this field.  The collaboration should be  productive with many mutual benefits anticipated.    ***",
