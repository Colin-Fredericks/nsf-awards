 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lambda Calculus is both a mathematical theory of functions  and a model of computation. As such it is part of the  interface of applied logic and theoretical computer science.  As a theory, simply typed Lambda Calculus is part of  Church's theory of functions of higher type. Higher type  theorem proving reduces questions of validity of sentences  to unification and conversion, which are purely equational  questions of Lambda Calculus. Lambda Calculus also enters  implicitly into the proof theory of type theory via the well  known Curry-Howard isomorphism. As a formal model of  computation Lambda Calculus contributes to understanding of  higher-type and type-free programming constructs.  Denotational semantics reduces questions of program  synthesis and correctness to finding and verifying solutions  to certain combinatory functional equations. Lambda Calculus  also enters explicitly into the syntactic foundations of  applicative programming languages as a paradigm of  sequential computation. In short, Lambda Calculus enters  both explicitly and implicitly into the theory of highertype  theorem proving and the theory of programming languages.  Lambda Calculus is the study of certain computation rules,  programs, or algorithms. This research singles out those  rules whose execution depends only on the fact that some of  the data are themselves computation rules of the same sort.  It is not immediately obvious that there are any non-trivial  examples of such rules. The rich deep structure of the  Lambda Calculus had to be diacovered by Church, Bernays,  Curry, Kleene, and those who followed them. The research  focuses on the deep structure of pure Lambda Calculus with  at most algebraic types, to address a number of open  questions in Lambda Calculus. These include: (1) Is it  decidable whether a given finite set of proper combinators  forms a  basis?  (2) Is there a recursive one-step Church  Rosser strategy?  (3) Is there a uniform universal  generator? (4) Is the word problem for all proper  com binators of order < 3 decidable?  (5) Is the matching  problem for the pure simply typed lambda calculus  decidable?  ***",
