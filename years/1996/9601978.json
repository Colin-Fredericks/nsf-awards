 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State University of New York College at Fredonia prepares to  advocate the significant impact and findings of the nationwide  funded Summer Science Camps (SSC) by publishing the \"Summer Science  Camp Accountability Document\" and disseminating these findings to  local, regional, state and nationwide educational, scientific and  gubernatorial institutions and organizations to make the SSC  experiences widely useful and usable.  In view that the NSF sides  with and encourages open scientific communication from research and  educational activities developed in their funding programs, hence  this proposal seeks to achieve these objectives:    To have the \"SSC Accountability Document\" available for potential  math and science project directors who want to know and find  projects to visit and to work in.    To make available the \"SSC Accountability Document\" to  congressional offices, foundations, private corporations, public  libraries, postsecondary institutions, and other agencies which  want to know what is being done for disadvantages students in  interesting them and guiding them toward the fields of math and  science as career avenues.    To offer the \"SSC Accountability Document\" to current project  directors who want to advertise and distribute their SSC programs  to funding agencies and by others as a source of data about their  nationwide math and science early intervention programs for  disadvantaged students.  ***",
