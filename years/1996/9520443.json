 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520443  Marcy    Our Solar System remains the lone planetary system that is known to  be around a normal star.  Current observational efforts have failed  to discover extrasolar planets at a threshold of the mass three  times that of Jupiter orbiting approximately 30 solar-type stars.   A search for extrasolar planets, by observing the reflex  acceleration of the hmst stars, measured by the Doppler effect,  will be carried out.  As our Sun executes a velocity amplitude  change of 13 m/sec (as observed from outside the solar system) due  primarily to Jupiter, it is planned to achieve a Doppler  measurement precision of 2 m/sec to ensure detection of giant  planets orbiting around other stars.  This unprecedented Doppler  measurement precision stems from novel developments in spec-  trometer design and spectral analysis.  In addition, a new Schmidt  camera has been specially engineered to produce a sharp, symmetric  Point Spread Function (PSF) over the full format of a fast echelle  spectrometer.  A 2048x2048 CCD detector will be used to gather all  stellar Doppler information, within 1000 Angstroms wavelength,  spread over 30,000 CCD pixels.  The analysis of the Doppler shifts  in the spectra will consist of an entirely novel simultaneous  solution of all spectrometer parameters (wavelength scale and PSF)  and Doppler shift.    A  detailed error budget for the Doppler measurements yields a  bottom line accuracy of 2 m/sec.  This precision renders the  detection of Jupiter-like planets detectable at the 5 sigma level,  and Saturn-like planets will be marginally detectable.  Actual test  observations of the spectra of Solar-like stars enable one to  achieve a precision of 3.5 m/sec.  This accuracy will be improved  with the next-generation Doppler analysis techniques.  Already,  however, by averaging sets of five exposures, the error in the mean  is less than 2 m/sec.   It is planned to monitor 15 G-type and K-  type stars and make measurements of the Doppler wavelength shifts  to a precision of 2  m/sec.  Eighty five other stars will be  observed with an accuracy of 5 m/sec in the measurement of the  Doppler wavelength shifts (depending on the brightness of the  individual stars).  These new techniques will make it possible to  observe stars and measure velocity changes, indicative of giant  planets,  within 3 years.",
