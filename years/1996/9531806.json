 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Greenleaf  9531806      Characteristic space-time estimates, previously obtained, for solutions  of wave equations will be extended and applied to yield results on the approximate determination of compactly supported, time-independent potentials in L^2 of 3-space from approximate knowledge of their backscattering (or other determined sets of scattering data.) Extensions of such results to potentials with noncompact support and of N-particle type will be pursued. Estimates, in terms of Sobolev and Lebesgue norms, for Fourier integral operators associated with canonical relations exhibiting cusp singularities, both simple and of higher order, will be investigated. Such estimates have applications to regularity properties of averaging operators associated with integrals over generic families of lines and curves in n-dimensional space. Finally, classes of Fourier integral operators arising from real analogues of Goncharov's complexes of hyperplane sections of algebraic arieties of minimal degree in n-dimensional projective space will be studied, with the goal of obtaining composition calculi for them.    The principal object of this project will be the study of several types of singular integral operators and Fourier integral operators. Such operators, which transform functions on one space into functions on another (possibly different) space, have become  central tools in the study of linear partial differential equations which govern diverse physical phenomena, such as electromagnetic  fields and sound propagation. The particular  operators to be studied in this project arise in the scattering of  waves by potential functions, and in  tomography, the mathematical basis for a variety of medical imaging systems, such as CAT and MRI scanners. Thus, progress on the problems considered in this project will contribute to the theoretical underpinnings of procedures for reconstructing unknown quantities of physical interest from noninvasive observations. Despite the fact that they arise in d ifferent problems, the operators to be studied share several common features, which  involve more complicated geometry than is present in the  original versions of singular integral and Fourier integral operators. It is hoped that, eventually, improved understanding of these operators will lead to improved reconstruction techniques.",
