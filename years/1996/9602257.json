 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602257  Mendoza  This award provides limited additional funds to an  established multidisciplinary Research Training Group (RTG)  in Animal Behavior.  First established in 1992, the RTG has  helped create a focus for research and education at all post-  secondary levels in the University of California at Davis.  The study of animal behavior provides new insights into the  study of animals as organisms.  Increasingly,  multidisciplinary approaches that recognize the interaction  of genetic, developmental, physiological and environmental  determinants are playing an important role in the analysis  of behavior. The group of participating faculty has grown to  include 26 junior and senior investigators from 10  departments of the University.  The funds awarded will  provide short-term stipends for graduate students that  permit summer fieldwork and other summer research  activities.  In addition, funds will be used to bring  investigators from other research and academic institutions  to the campus for an intensive spring workshop that caps a  year-long course in interdisciplinary studies of animal  behavior open to all students..  ***",
