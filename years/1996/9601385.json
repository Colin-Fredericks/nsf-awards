 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 9601385  PI: Melody V.S. Siegler    The nervous system has segmental populations of neurons that are diversified to meet the requirements of sensory and motor processing along the length of an animal's body. The work to be performed assesses the contributions of two cellular processes to segmental diversification and specialization during the course of embryonic development: cell proliferation and cell death. In a model system, Schistocerca americana, each segment of the central nervous system develops from an array of neuroblasts, each of which can be identified as an individual. Each neuroblast produces a \"family\" of clonally related neurons. For example, one neuroblast in each segment, called the median neuroblast (MNB), generates a family of neurons containing neurons of two different types, motor neurons, which innervate muscles, and interneurons, which interconnect sensory and motor neurons. In the thoracic segments the MNB families contain about 100 neurons, 20 of which are motor neurons. In the abdominal segments the MNB families contain about 50 neurons, only 3 of which are motor neurons.  The idea  will be tested that the MNBs, and other neuroblasts in anterior segments, divide at about twice the rate of the comparable neuroblasts in the posterior segments, initially generating neuronal pools of larger or smaller sizes. In addition, the role of cell death in setting the final population size of neuroblast families  will be investigated . Cell death appears to remove many neurons in abdominal regions, but few neurons in thoracic regions, providing a second mechanism for generating larger thoracic and smaller abdominal segments.  Related studies will focus on the hypothesis that there are domains of cell death and of cell proliferation that correspond roughly, but not precisely, to thoracic and abdominal regions. Their imprecise overlap leads to three rather than two potential outcomes, thus: a large neuronal population results from high proliferation rates and low cell death, an int ermediate neuronal population results from high proliferation rates and high cell death, and a small neuronal population results from low proliferation rates and high cell death.  Knowledge of how these fundamental cellular processes shape segmental identity is crucial to an understanding of development of the mature central nervous system.",
