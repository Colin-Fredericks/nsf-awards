 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to facilitate and enhance the match between user needs  and the capabilities and products of the emerging space weather service.  It is noted  that it is necessary for the success of an applied program that the requirements of the  eventual users must be introduced into the planning of the program at an early stage.   To facilitate this, this program will involve establishing a close working relationship  between engineers and operators in the user community and space scientists and  forecasters.  This will be accomplished through workshops.  Activities will focus on  seeking areas where 1) a close match between needs and capabilities already exist,  2) better understanding of the capabilities and needs can generate more easily  achievable matches, and 3) finding new areas where space weather service can be  usefully applied.  The output of this program will be suggestions of specific  applications where either near term implementation or more detailed feasibility  studies should be considered.",
