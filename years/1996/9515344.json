 "awd_abstract_narration": "9515344  Scholz    Why do citizens obey democratic laws?  Consider, for example tax  laws to collect money for desired public goods or environmental  laws to minimize widely-recognized public bads.  Obedience would  leave everyone better off, but the temptation to free ride and  shirk citizenship duties makes obedience an uncertain proposition.   Is Hobbesian deterrence essential to gain compliance, or can social  cooperation support compliance with laws designed to resolve  collective action problems?    Scholz's prior NSF research suggests that compliance behavior can  only partly be explained by deterrence, and that a theory of  cooperation in collective action situations is needed to understand  obedience with democratic laws.  His proposed \"trust heuristic\"  explains cooperation in terms of trust in government, trust in  other citizens, and other civic attitudes that reflect the positive  and negative experiences the citizen has with the cooperative.  Tm  the extent that the individual's likelihood of cooperation  increases as attitudes become more positive toward the collective,  these attitudinal heuristics replicate the \"nice, retaliatory, yet  forgiving\" characteristics associated with robust cooperative  strategies in prisoners dilemma games, and hence may provide the  basis for social cooperation.  The trust heuristic represents  \"social capital\" which dramatically increases the ability of weak  enforcement agencies to maintain compliance (cooperation) with laws  resolving collective action problems.    To further develop and test this hypothesis and also to provide a  more solid foundation for the theory of cooperation in large-scale  collective action settings, the current research:   1) extends existing results based on 2-person, full information  prisoners dilemma games to investigate the generic properties of  robust strategies capable of supporting cooperative solutions to n-  person collective action problems.   2) utilizes laboratory experiments to test the correspondence  bet ween formal strategies and heuristics used by human subjects in  collective action settings.    The research integrates the diverse approaches of five productive  researchers essential for tackling the challenging problem of  cooperation in large-scale collective action settings.  The  combined methodology can be applied to numerous other collective  action problems and should be of great interest to a variety of  social science researchers.  ***",
