 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626107  Huang       The investigator develops a moving mesh method for the  numerical solution of two- and three-dimensional time-dependent  PDEs (partial differential equations) that extends the MMPDE  (Moving Mesh PDE) approach introduced by the investigator and his  coworkers for PDEs in one spatial dimension.  With this approach,  an MMPDE is formulated explicitly based upon the heat flow  equation and the theory of harmonic maps.  The MMPDE is employed  to move the mesh, to concentrate nodes in regions where the  physical solution has large variations, and to control certain  mesh qualities, in particular the skewness.  Techniques are  investigated to discretize and solve efficiently the extended  system consisting of the underlying physical PDE and the MMPDE.  A  number of related issues are considered - e.g., the computation  of a reference mesh for an arbitrary connected domain, the use of  flow directional control, the study of preconditioning  techniques, the examination of the space-time finite element  method, and the investigation of robustness and reliability of  the method.  Moreover, the method is applied to problems in  airfoil analysis and wing design, moving boundary problems, and  problems involving blow-up solutions.  The new algorithms and  computational techniques are simultaneously implemented in  mathematical software that could find widespread usage among  scientists and engineers.       This project is concerned with the development of new  computational methods that are essential to enhance the ability  of scientists and engineers to solve large scale computational  problems that are crucial to our economy, environment, and  security.  The research is focused on development of so-called  adaptive numerical techniques, where the special features of the  particular problem being solved are adapted to.  More  specifically, the places (mesh points) where the solution to the  scientific problem is being approximated are moved with time to  adapt to the changes in the solu tion.  Mesh adaptation has  recently played an indispensable role in the numerical solution  of the problems, as, supercomputers notwithstanding, such  problems can generally not otherwise be solved satisfactorily.  This is because in many problems of science and engineering,  there is a small portion of the physical domain where large  changes in the solution occur over very small separations in the  mesh.  Numerical solution of these problems using fixed uniform  meshes is formidable because millions of mesh points are required  to resolve the physical phenomena.  On the other hand, use of  adaptive mesh methods can significantly reduce the number of mesh  points and thus economies can be gained.  Unlike other adaptive  mesh methods, the moving mesh method under study changes the mesh  smoothly in time to adapt to the key solution features.  It is  suitable for parallel computing.  The moving mesh method should be  very useful in the numerical simulation of many industrial  manufacturing problems.  A particular area is airfoil analysis and  wing design.  For example, in the airfoil and wing design the  airfoil or wing shape is computed when a pressure distribution is  specified.  It will save computing resources tremendously if the  flow solution and the computational mesh, and hence the airfoil  shape, can be updated simultaneously, as these methods do.  This  advantage holds for a variety of other applications as well, such  as the problem of studying how and why industrial and house fires  start.  The investigator believes that a `moving mesh' approach is  the best way to reduce computing time and improve accuracy, and  that the actual technology transfer for these methods is close at  hand.",
