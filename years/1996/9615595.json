The planning activities consist of post-production and evaluation of a new version of the pilot episode of the series.  WNET will reversion the pilot episode to address concerns raised by the reviewers to a previous proposal, as well as incorporating recommendations from the formative evaluation conducted by RMC Research Corporation.   During the planning phase, the producers will work closely with Dr. Betty Faber and Mark Testa, two environmental educators with expertise in extra-curricular settings.  These educators have been added to the advisory committee and Dr. Faber will serve as lead content advisor to the project.  After production of the revised pilot is completed, RMC Research Corporation will conduct another evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the revisions to the project.",
