 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and implement procedures that will enhance communication between investigators who report results and their audience (i.e., other investigators, decision makers, and students).  These user-friendly procedures will enable clients to alter investigators' priors, examine alternative posterior moments, and combine models.  Software will be developed with standard file structures to facilitate control between it and user software.  This software will enable clients to evaluate the accuracy of reweighted output, plot corresponding posterior densities, and average across models to obtain posterior moments unconditional on models.  It is expected that this project will have two significant impacts in the social sciences.  First, it will place within the reach of all quantitative social scientists many of the inherent advantages of Bayesian analysis by removing the unreasonable computational demands that have previously been required.  Second, it will enable clients to rework investigators' analyses by modifying their priors, examining alternative posterior moments, and updating samples, in less time than is required to read a typical research report.  Together these impacts should greatly encourage analysis of the robustness of policy recommendations with respect to assumptions and accelerate the application of new research to policy problems.",
