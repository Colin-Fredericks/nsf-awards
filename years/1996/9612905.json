 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feldman  9612905    The goal of  the Hanau Model  Schools Partnership is to infuse technology throughout the Model Schools so that learning with technology becomes a deeply accepted part of daily  school life. Our two-year implementation plan will  focus on these three schools of the Partnership. We will also develop strategies to assist Department of Defense Education Activities (DoDEA)  in scaling up technology infusion from   one set of schools to the entire system and thereby shed light on the process of technology infusion for school districts nationally.      The implementation plan for technology infusion was developed through an intensive seven-month  planning process that involved the staff at TERC and members of the Hanau school community, the Hessen District Office, and the DoDEA office in Washington DC. This plan focuses on four key principles that we believe to be essential if a technology initiative is to be successful.    * Community-based planning.  Successful technology infusion efforts must be strongly grounded in the communities in which they occur. Community-based planning anchors the vision and the process of  identifying and aligning resources for the initiative.  * Sustained professional development.  Technology infusion efforts must provide teachers with sustained support for making deep-seated changes to their practices.  Such support must include formal and informal professional development opportunities, as well as on-site support for day-to-day classroom implementation.  * Access to new technologies. Technology infusion must provide students and teachers with equitable access to the new technologies  * Contiuous evaluation.  Communities  successfully engaged in technology infusion continually reflect upon their practice as they change and grow.    These principles derive from what we have learned from our partners in Hanau, investigation of the literature on technology integration and educational reform, and discussions with national experts in these fields. Weaving t hese principles together as components  of a comprehensive initiative is a powerful strategy for educational improvement.    In this proposal we describe the work accomplished during the planning phase of the project-what we did and what we learned. Next we outline the implementation plan, describing the major activities and the ways in which we aim to fulfill them over the two years of the project. We discuss the significance of this project for DoDEA and others concerned with scaling up from model schools to the full system. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of what we envision teaching and learning may look like in the model schools at the end of the project.  ***",
