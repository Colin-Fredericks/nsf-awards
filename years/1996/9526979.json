 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support for a program to measure the stable  isotope (deuterium to hydrogen and oxygen-18 to oxygen-16)  concentrations of ice cores retrieved from Siple Dome as part of  the West Antarctic ice sheet program.  In addition, the deuterium  excess of samples from the Taylor Dome ice core will be  determined.  This project will approach the question of rapid  climate change using ice cores to determine the history of  temperature changes, moisture source changes, and elevational  changes in the West Antarctic ice sheet.  Results from ice cores  taken to date in the interior of Antarctica (East and West) are  surprisingly lacking in indications of abrupt climate changes,  such as those that have been observed in the GISP2 ice core from  Summit, Greenland.   This work will address the question of  whether rapid climate changes, which are known to have occurred  in other parts of the southern hemi-sphere, may have also  occurred in the coastal regions of West Antarctica.  There is  some indication from existing records of isotopes in ice cores  that the West Antarctic ice sheet may have flushed ice in the  past (as evidenced by large changes in elevation of the ice  sheet).",
