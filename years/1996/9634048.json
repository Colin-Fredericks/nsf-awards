In this four-year project, PRIME will support teachers in the classroom implementation of standards-based mathematics instruction and assessment in grades K-12 through the use of exemplary instructional materials (e.g., Everyday Mathematics in grades K-3, Connected Mathematics in grades 6-8, and materials from other grades to be determined from a defined menu).   PRIME will also help teachers attain a broad knowledge base in both the mathematics content and successful mathematics pedagogy needed in order to understand and implement the new materials successfully.      As a Local Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement project (and one of the initial  projects funded at the middle/high school levels under the guidelines for Local Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics, Grades 7-12), PRIME will provide all 924 Pittsburgh Public Schools teachers of mathematics with a range of activities that include multi-day summer workshops, prime-time, release-day professional development workshops, and individualized, in-class support provided by demonstration teachers and/or mathematics lead teachers within each school.   By equipping all Pittsburgh mathematics teachers with the knowledge, skills, and support necessary for effectively using exemplary materials and assessments, PRIME will ensure that all students experience a coherent mathematics program that will yield high achievement at all levels.  All teachers of grades 6-12 receive 234 hours of professional development, and teachers of grades K-5 receive 102-132 hours.      Cost-sharing in the project is approximately $ 6 million, primarily from the Pittsburgh Public Schools.",
