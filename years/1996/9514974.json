The analytic approach involves formal modeling of the  incentives facing politically motivated elected representatives,  and the actions taken by special interest groups in pursuit of  particularlistic benefits.  The ongoing research concentrates in  three main areas.  First, it examines the dynamics of trade  policy in response to a one-shot change in the terms of trade and  to recurring shifts in comparative advantage.  The analysis  incorporates politicians who have short-time horizons and who  cannot commit the future course of trade policy.  Second, it  studies the design of political rules and institutions, both  domestic and international, that can promote more efficient trade  policy outcomes.  Finally, it integrates this work and related  research on the political economy of trade policy, in the form of  an integrative monograph covering a range of topics and  approaches.         Recent public debate over trade policy has pitted  environmentalists against free trade interests.  The previous  work by the investigators demonstrated that there is no  presumption that trade liberalization will be harmful to the  environment.  In this project the investigators examine the  political economy of the interaction between different policy  issues.  Suppose that environmentalists expect that environmental  standards at home will be looser if trade is freer than if trade  barriers protect special interests in the import-competing  industries.  Then the environmentalists might support protection  in order to secure stricter standards and prevent \"downward  harmonization,\" even if trade protection is not directly in their  own interest.",
