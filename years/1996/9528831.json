 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Chemistry Program provides support for a collaborative research project   involving Drs. David B. Rorabacher and Ronald R. Schroeder of the   Chemistry Department, Wayne State University, and Dr. Leo A. Ochrymowycz   of the Chemistry Department, University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.  They   will synthesize a series of copper thiaether, thiaamine, and thiapyridine   complexes in which both copper (I) and copper(II) oxidation states are   accessible.  The thirty-one macrocyclic ligands targeted for study are   specifically designed to impose differing types of constraints within the   ligand framwork.  Using cyclic voltammetry, stopped-flow kinetics, NMR   line broadening studies, and selected structural determinations, they   will investigate the relationship between ligand geometric changes and   transfer of electrons to and from the copper centers in these complexes.     Under some conditions, the rate of the reaction in one direction will be   `gated` by the requirement for the intermediate to undergo a   conformational change. Molecular mechanical calculations will be used to   compare the energies of reaction intermediates generated during the   electron transfer step and develop some predictive capability.  Complexes of copper(I) and copper(II) are known to have different   geometries, so that upon oxidation or reduction it is likely that   conformational changes will occur.  A conformational change creates an   energy barrier to electron transfer.  If this energy barrier can be   controlled, then it becomes possible for electron transfer to occur in   one direction, that is, to be `gated.`  This topic is of considerable   current interest in biological chemistry, because it may be important in   the reactions of metalloproteins.  This research will help answer   questions about the extent to which conformational changes in the   proteins or around the metal binding site are involved in natural   systems, as well as point the way to design of specific catalysts.",
