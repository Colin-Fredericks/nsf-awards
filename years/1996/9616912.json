These changes reflect changes in the relationship  of government and academic institutions and, in turn,  changes in the perceptions of the institutions and their  faculty as they view of their own roles in society.  Although such change is normal and healthy, increasingly the  impetus for change comes from lack of growth in support for  faculty research by Federal agencies, increased emphasis on  teaching by the largest institutions, and changing patterns  of employment among graduates.  The effects of these changes  on  institutional policy and practice, and their  implications for Federal agencies that fund research and  education in the biological sciences will be explored.",
