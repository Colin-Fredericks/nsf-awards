 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to study the use of wavelet-based, computer aided methods to design mechanical components.  The research seeks alternatives to the standard, finite-element based modeling practice that are simpler to use and do not sacrifice accuracy or mathematical rigor.  Methods to be investigated are intended to be used at the conceptual design stage.  They will enhance the design process by relieving much of the burden associated with the detailed modeling of component geometries that is typical in standard finite-element based methodologies.  The research also focuses on the use of wavelet-based approaches to the solution of the problem of optimization of the layout of material to enhance structural performance.   If successful, this investigation will provide the foundation for new computer-aided tools for design of mechanical components with a variety of applications, typically in automotive and aerospace industries.  These new tools will be simpler to use and more accessible than those that are currently available to designers in standard practice.  They also will address the problem of design of structural components at a stage where improvements can have most impact on cost or overall performance.  The result should be enhanced productivity by putting better, more effective tools in the hands of a broader audience.",
