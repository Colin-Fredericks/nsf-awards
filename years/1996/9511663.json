 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511663  Spiller    Telecommunications is an industry which is undergoing rapid  change and renewed competition.  In this era, there is still no  general agreement about the appropriate approach for encouraging  modernization of the regulated U.S. telephone system.    This research will specifically look at the impact of regulation  on modernization through local exchange companies' adoption of  digital infrastructure.  Prior research has found that various  forms of incentive regulation, and in particular price  regulation, has led to greater deployment of digital  infrastructure than has traditional rate of return regulation.   In addition that price regulation works more effectively than  earnings-sharing schemes, although price regulation works better  paired with earnings-sharing schemes than when used alone.  The  proposed research builds on this previous research by looking at  the political influences on adoption of particular regulatory  schemes and on the speed of adoption of digital infrastructure.   A data set which includes political variables will be constructed  to facilitate this research.",
