 "awd_abstract_narration": "Durrett will continue to apply the theory of stochastic spatial  models to problems in biology, specifically studying: (a)  abundance distributions generated by the voter model with  mutation that are an alternative to the traditional lognormal,  (b) hybrid zones and their scaling limits -- motion by mean  curvature, (c) a generalization of the biased voter model used by  Silvertown to model the competition of grass species, and (d) a  nonlinear predator prey model that displays oscillatory behavior.   In an interacting particle system, space is represented as a grid  of sites each one of which can be in one of a finite set of  states and changes its state at a rate that depends on the states  of finitely many neighbors. These models have a structure that is  well suited to many problems in biology and have recently seen  many applications there. Durrett's investigations will continue  previous work seeking to understand when the spatial distribution  of individuals has an important effect on the outcome of  competition and when it can be ignored. Earlier work has already  identified a number of situations in which non-spatial approaches  give incorrect answers to questions about the persistence or  coexistence of competing species.",
