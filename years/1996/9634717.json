 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focuses on the development of an  innovative passive techniques for vibration suppression and  control. A design technique of solid free-free structural  optimization is formulated. In this design methodology, a  structure is defined as a spatial arrangement of micro-  structural elements. The structural design starts with a  specified design domain as a union of every conceivable  design space that can possess materials without violating  any geometric and loading constraints. Then the design  domain is divided into many small design cells. Each of the  design cells is modeled as a `composite` material with micro-  geometry perforations. By changing the parameters defining  the micro-geometric structures, the topology and shape of  the structure is represented effectively and desired  structural dynamic characteristics can be obtained during  the research project. Two major passive vibration  suppression techniques are investigated:(i) eigenstructure  assignment, and (ii) frequency response function shaping.  The essence of the first approach is to derive the response  of a structure in terms of a set of desired modal  properties, whereas the second approach aims at controlling  the overall response characteristics of the structure at  certain critical points and through a bandwidth of interest.  The proposed approaches are validated by using scaled models  in experimental testing. The results of this research lead  to the development of robust design techniques of passive  vibration control for aerospace and automotive applications,  and a new structural design tool for substantial performance  improvement in lightweight engineering structures.",
