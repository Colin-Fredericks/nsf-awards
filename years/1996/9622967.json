In this project  the  proposer investigates new nontrivial optimality conditions for  abnormal  trajectories and their role in connection with discontinuities in  the value  function. Most existing results for optimality  do not apply to  abnormal  extremals or require continuity of the value function. The  occurence of  abnormal processes is related to the fact the surjectivity  condition in the  Lyusternik theorem is not satisfied and as a result the classical  nontrivial  results cannot be derived. While mathematically desirable,  continuity of the  value function relates to small-time local controllability and  need not be  satisfied for many control systems with free terminal time.   Abnormal  processes which satisfy the Maximum Principle do so regardless of  the  objective. Hence if they are really optimal this strongly hints  that in a  certain sense they are the only possible candidates to solve the  problem  whereas closeby trajectories fail to do so. Thus optimal abnormal  processes  somehow correspond to limiting or boundary-like behaviors of  optimal  trajectories which strongly correlates them with discontinuities  in the  value function. It is expected that the analysis of  discontinuities in the  value function coupled with existing theory provides a solution  methodology  to the general problem in optimal control. The proposal consists  of two  separate but closely related parts. The first part is a  continuation of  previous work and addresses further developments of the  proposer's earlier  theory of nontrivial optimality conditions for abnormal processes  based on  second order approximations. A high-order generalization of the  Lyusternik  theorem without surjectivity condition and high -order  approximations to the  constraint sets are investigated. Using these results extended  nontrivial  first and second order necessary conditions for optimality of  both normal  and abnormal problems in optimization and optimal control are  analyzed.  A  generalization of the proposer's existing results to a nonsmooth  setting  coupled with direct approximations in the dual space by means of  normal  cones is being pursued. In the second part of the project the  proposer  investigates sufficient conditions for the optimality of abnormal  trajectories. In particular, the proposer analyses the role which  is played  by optimal abnormal extremals in the construction of a regular  synthesis.  %%%  There are two fundamental approaches to finding the solution of  optimal  control problems: 1) finding the optimal processes through an  analysis of  the Maximum principle and 2) finding the value-function as a  solution of the  Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Both of these are in general  rather  difficult objectives to achieve and depend on the specifics of  the problem  under investigation. On the other hand, judging by the known  examples the  discontinuities of the value-function seem to relate rather  directly to  abnormal processes. Since both abnormal processes and  discontinuities of the  value function are indicating the limiting behaviors of optimal  trajectories  the proposer expects that there exists a relation between these  two  phenomena in general. In this project the proposer investigates  optimal  abnormal trajectories in optimal control and their role in  connection with  discontinuities in the value function. It is expected that the  analysis of  discontinuities in the value function coupled with existing  theory provides  a solution  methodology to the general problem in optimal control.
