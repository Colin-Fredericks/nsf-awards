 "awd_abstract_narration": "9554198  Garik    The Project on Quantum Science Across Disciplines proposes to  design and implement an introduction to quantum science for high  school students and undergraduates in biology, chemistry, and  physics through activities integrating computer modeling tools, a  data resource base, and hands-on experiments; do research on  student response to materials intended to introduce quantum science  at a level appropriate for interdisciplinary inquiry with hooks  paths between biology, chemistry, and physics; and, investigate the  extent to which a technologically rich approach to teaching  interdisciplinary science can fundamentally change high school and  college instructional practices.    The target audiences are the high school students and  undergraduates for whom it is important to develop scientific  literacy as defined by the AAAS 2061 Project and the Draft National  Science Education Standards (NSES) prepared by the National  Research Council. An understanding of the methods and results of  scientific research and the tools of technology are important for  the broad spectrum of students studying science, whether for  satisfaction of diploma requirements, technical professional  training, or preparation for advanced study. The new materials will  be aimed at high school classes, undergraduates, and adult  education courses with the potential for science teacher in-service  training.    The goal is to provide students with the tools to navigate between  the representations for quantum science adopted by each of the  sciences. As the theory for the microscopic processes which affect  all the sciences, quantum science can be a means for providing an  integrated approach to science education. The examples of quantum  science will be drawn from biology, chemistry, and physics, will  reflect research scientists' mental models for the process in  question, and will be coupled to laboratory experiments. Each of  the subject modules will be independently usable in an introductory  courses;  however, their linkage will encourage interdisciplinary  instruction.    Earlier projects have demonstrated the change in classroom  structure, communication, and the role of the teacher that results  from the combination of inquiry oriented projects and rich  technology. Students have the technological tools to pursue their  own independent projects, while the teacher takes on the role of  mentor and advisor. Electronic journals provide new opportunities  for student-student and teacher-student dislodges, combining the  best features of journal writing and portfolio assessment.  ***",
