 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529310  Lee       A famous problem in 3-dimensional topology is to list all finite  groups which are the fundamental group of some closed 3-manifold.  Since  all the known examples come from subgroups of the rotation group that  act freely on the 3-sphere, the manifolds involved have positive constant  curvature, and the problem is known as the spherical space-form problem.  Together with I. Hambleton, Ronnie Lee plans to solve this problem using  Donaldson's theory of instantons.  Closely related to the above and in  collaboration with S.Cappell and E.Miller, Ronnie Lee plans to study  generalizations of Casson's invariants and show that they belong to the  so-called \"finite type invariants.\"  With Weiping Li, the principal  investigator plans to investigate two types of Floer homologies.  The first,  known as the instanton Floer homology, is obtained by applying Morse  theory to an infinite dimensional space of connections, and the second,  known as the symplectic Floer homology, is based on the Lagrangian  intersection theory of a representation variety.  They plan to show that  these are the same theory and hence establish a conjecture of Atiyah.  Finally, with Wilczynski, the principal investigator plans to study the  problem of finding locally flat surfaces of minimum genus representing a  given homology class of a simply connected 4-manifold.  In the smooth  setting, the corresponding problem is known as the Thom conjecture and  has been solved recently by P.Kronheimer and T.Mrowka to great acclaim.       In short, the project plans to study several well-known  problems in 3- and 4-dimensional manifold theory concerning the basic  symmetric nature of these objects and also the geometry of the  submanifolds inside them.  Many of the techniques to be used in solving these  problems are new and were not previously available.  They were  developed through the interaction between quantum physics and topology  in recent years.  On the mathematics side they are known under the  heading of Sympl ectic Invariants, while on the physics side they have  their counterpart in Quantum Field Theory.  ***",
