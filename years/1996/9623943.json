 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623943  Gomez-Rodriguez         The Puerto Rico Alliance for Minority Participation Phase II  joins 14 universities, National Laboratories and local industry to  increase the quality and number of Hispanic BS degrees in SMET  conferred by PR-AMP institutions each year by a total of 1,425,  growing from the current 2,646 to 4,071.  Up to 2/3 of these will  be low-income and/or first generation college students.  PR-AMP  universities conferred 1,896 BS degrees in 1993, which represents  23.7% of the 7,995 degrees conferred nationally to Hispanics,  making PR-AMP institutions a key resource for producing Hispanic  SMET graduates.  Through PR-AMP Phase II, about 32,000 student  participants are expected to benefit from the PR-AMP program.   Institutional effectiveness and efficiency will be optimized to  increase the average graduation rates of PR-AMP institutions from  the current annual rate of 32% to 60%.  PhDs in SMET conferred to  BS graduates from PR-AMP will increase from the current annual  average of 48 to 83.         The thrust of PR-AMP Phase II activities will target the  undergraduate component of the SMET pipeline, as major systemic  strategies are already in place on the island to address the pre-  college (PR Systemic Statewide Initiative) and graduate  (Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research-EPSCoR)  levels. Building on those strategies piloted and found effective in  Phase I and creating new initiatives to address all key aspects of  the barriers to SMET education, Phase II will develop the   following core strategies:  changing the teaching/learning culture,  faculty attitudes and curriculum though the curricular revision of  SMET curricula to incorporate effective teaching strategies bases  on an inquiry approach to learning and effective classroom  assessment method, with emphasis on gatekeeper and bottleneck  courses; faculty, industry and peer mentoring program to provide  SMET students with a network of academic and social support;  strengthening undergraduat e research with emphasis on local  graduate research centers, National Laboratories and industry  internships; stipends for low-income SMET students to address  financial need and stimulate participation in the PR-AMP process;  incorporation of multimedia technology in the learning process;  special bridging component, with pre-college to college engineering  program and an undergraduate to graduate transition program; a  teacher preparation program to improve the competence of future  SMET teachers; and the development of an institutional research and  strategic planning capability to measure variables that indicate  the value-added in terms of student outcomes and institutional  effectiveness and efficiency.",
