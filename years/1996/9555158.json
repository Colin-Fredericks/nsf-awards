 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies have indicated that the lecture/laboratory method of  teaching introductory physics is not as effective as many  teachers would like for it to be. Some non-traditional  methods have recently been developed in an attempt to remedy  this problem; however, they depend heavily on the use of  computers. Many colleges and universities have neither the  funds nor the facilities for computer-based programs.  There  is an even more pressing need for low-cost innovation and  new technology in high school physics classes. A comparable,  but less expensive, program is needed.  The goal of this  project is to improve the quality of algebra-based  introductory physics at the college level (and eventually at  the high school level) by providing a more cost-effective  way of utilizing the benefits of new technology within an  activity-based format. This project will develop and test  the effectiveness of an activity-based approach to teaching  algebra-based introductory college physics that makes  extensive use of the new calculator-based laboratory (CBL)  system from Texas Instruments to collect and analyze data.  This approach results in considerable cost savings compared  to computer implementation. For twelve computer-based  stations the cost is approximately $50,000 compared to about  $10,000 for twelve calculator-based stations.  The results  of the evaluation will show the effectiveness of the  activity-based CBL approach to teaching introductory algebra-  based physics as compared to the traditional  lecture/laboratory method. These results will be submitted  for publication to appropriate periodicals. The written  materials will be published in workbook form. The software  that is developed will be available on the internet through  Texas Instruments' archives and the department's WWW site.",
