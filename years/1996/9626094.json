 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Charles D. Sherrill has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Sherrill received the doctoral degree from   the University of Georgia under the supervision of Professor Henry   Schaefer.  Dr. Sherrill will continue research at the University of   California at Berkeley under the sponsorship of Professor Martin   Head-Gordon.  The postdoctoral research will focus on the investigation   of nonadiabatic energy flow between molecules and metal surfaces.  The   approach will take into account nuclear-electronic coupling to   investigate nonadiabatic effects on gas-surface sticking, diffusion, and   high energy scattering.  Also of interest is the process of laser-induced   desorption of gas molecules from metal surfaces, which involves   nonadiabatic energy transfer from conduction electrons to vibrational   modes of the adsorbate.  Studies are aided by high-quality experimental   data on laser-induced desorption now available.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
