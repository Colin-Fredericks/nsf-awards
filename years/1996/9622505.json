 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622505  Diaz       This workshop will evaluate the capability of the  meteorological observing networks of the Americas to address the  following World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) questions:  Is  the climate warming?  Is the hydrologic cycle changing?  Is the  atmospheric circulation changing?  Is the climate becoming more  variable or extreme?         While meteorological observing networks are equipped to  monitor weather, most are not designed to address questions of  climate, including baselines, measurement uncertainty, and model  validation.  This workshop is designed to bring together the  appropriate members of the weather monitoring and climate research  communities in the Americas in order to identify the needs for a  climate monitoring system.  These needs include observational, data  management, and data distribution aspects (including the  identification of the critical climate variables to be included in  such a system).  This workshop will contribute to the effort of the  Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) community in evaluating the  observational needs for a global integrated climate observing  system.       This workshop will provide an excellent opportunity for the  directors of national meteorological services and climate  researchers to evaluate the current state of the weather data  collection systems and their capacity to contribute to future  climate research in the Americas.         This workshop is being co-sponsored by three organizations:   the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Program of the World  Meteorological Organization (WMO), the National Oceanographic  committee of Chile, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) on  behalf of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research  (IAI).  The IAI is a U.S. initiative to stimulate cooperative  research on global change issues among the scientific institutions  of the Americas.  The National Science Foundation is the U.S.  Government agency designated by the White House to carry out U.S.  resp onsibilities within the IAI.  ***",
