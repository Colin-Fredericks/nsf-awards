 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division   of NSF,  within the Research in Undergraduate Institutions Program,   Professor Scott Gronert will conduct research on gas phase dianions,   using electrospray mass spectrometry as the diagnostic instrument, at San   Francisco State University.  The gas phase ion community has worked   extensively with monoanion reactants, and a problem frequently   encountered is inability to detect the neutral products.  This work   offers a solution: use dianions, from which the neutral products will   actually be monoanions, not neutrals, and thus detectable by mass   spectrometry.  In this way branching ratios between nucleophilic   substitution and elimination, for example, become determinable   experimentally.  The work will be supported by ab initio computational   studies.    Understanding of substitutions and eliminations, well-known reactions   familiar to all students of undergraduate organic chemistry, is now   possible at a very fundamental level.  This work will compare   experimental yields and theoretically calculated product yields for   gas-phase reactions of these and other types.  The project will involve   4-6 students per year and all will be exposed to the interplay between   theory and experiment.",
