This  research will explore this question by examining basic mechanisms  of object perception, memory, and developmental changes in the  interface between perception and memory in 3- and 6-month-olds.    One prominent class of models of object perception assumes that a  limited set of fundamental features underlies all of object  perception and that, in adults, information about such individual  features is registered in parallel across the visual field during  the initial stages of object perception.  Evidence for these  propositions comes from the extensive study of pop-out effects in  adults.  The term \"pop-out\" refers to the phenomenon that an  object in a visual display that differs from surrounding objects  in terms of individual features is perceived effortlessly.  A  series of studies will examine whether infants exhibit adult-like  pop-out effects, the conditions that engender pop-out effects in  infancy, and whether the features viewed as building blocks of  object recognition in adults also play a similar role in infancy.    In addition to the detection of features, the perception of  relations among features is also critical for object recognition.   A set of studies will examine the stimulus conditions that  facilitate the encoding and memory of relational information in  infancy.  Also, prior research has revealed that, although  infants do remember both features and feature relations, they  forget feature relations sooner than the individual features that  comprise these  relations.  A series of studies will analyze  possible memory retrieval and interference mechanisms that  underlie this dissociation.    In addition to the physical aspects of stimuli, object  recognition is also  mediated by \"top-down\" processes such as  expectancies and the ability to selectively inhibit responding to  stimuli.  A final set of studies will examine devel opmental  changes during the first half year of life in these processes.    This research will contribute to the generation of a  comprehensive model of early perceptual and cognitive development  in normal infants, against which comparisons can be made to  describe, analyze, and mitigate various disorders, such as  attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity.      Exceptional education activities will include development of  audio-visual teaching materials and lab manuals to enhance both  research methods and survey courses in developmental psychology,  and special activities designed to provide minority high school  and undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in  research projects.    ***",
