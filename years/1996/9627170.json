 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627170  Kostant    Lisboa Associates, Inc. designing, producing, and evaluating a pilot unit for a thirteen-part, $3.5 to $4 million television series for pre-adolescent youth.  What's On Your Mind? - The adventures of the Brain Gang will center on the adventures of three youth 'neuro-nauts' who, through special effects combined with animation, will use their skills of observation and detection to solve each \"mystery\" from inside the brain itself.  Each episode will start with a question,  e.g. What does the brain have to do with how people see, smell, taste, feel, and hear?  Does what you eat affect your brain?  Are girls' brains different from boys' brains?  How does drug use affect the brain?.  The Brain Gang, once they are inside the brain will encounter obstacles and experience conflicts that can only be overcome or solved by relying on scientific methods.  The Brain Gang also will encounter animated characters, such as Neuro the Neuron and Endorpah the Endorphin, who will teach and explain important aspects of the brain to the young team of neuro-nauts.  The television series would be supported by ancillary material including a student/teacher guide, a newsletter for youth, and a teach newsletter.      The PI for the project will be Steven Kostant, an independent television producer and Creative Director for Broadcast and New Media at Lisboa Associates, Inc.  The Executive Producer for the project will be Eileen Michaels, Senior Vice President at Lisboa Associates, Inc. responsible for the organizations outreach programs in areas such as neuroscience and environmental topics.  The head writers will be Rich Albrecht and Casey Keller, formerly head writers for Beakman's World.  There will be three principal neuroscience advisors:  David Friedman, Associate Professor of Physiology and Pharmacology and Assistant Dean for Basic Sciences and Research Development, the Bowman Gray School of Medicine of Wake Forest University; Rochelle Schwarts, Associate Professor in the departments of Pharmacolo gy and Neurobiology at Duke University Medical Center; and Harold Goldman, Clinical Research Director, Neurology Unit of Harvard Community Health Plan and Instructor in Neurology at Harvard Medical School.",
