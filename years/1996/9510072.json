 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues and expands the research in the  design, development, and implementation of techniques for  enhancing the power and performance of equational systems.  The three key areas for this research effort are rewrite  operations, equational programming, and equational  deduction, though the results will likely also be applicable  to other areas such as (constraint) logic programming.  Research on rewrite operations will focus on variants of  pattern matching algorithms that are specifically tailored  to lazy evaluation strategies for functional programming and  to build the semantics of certain functions into the  matching algorithms for equational deduction.  The  investigations in equational deduction will center on the  PI's recently proposed basic completion method, in which no  inferences are applied at those subexpressions in formulas  that are built up  from substitutions generated in previous  inference steps.  The equational programming component of  the proposal will focus on the further development of Equals  --- a fast parallel implementation of a lazy language and  the Integral system which uses symbolic constraint solving  techniques to glue together program analyses across  different paradigms.  ***",
