For such  sharp interfaces, the mechanism of interfacial steps (in  analogy to dislocation jogs and kinks) along with  interactions of interfaces and obstacles (in analogy to  dislocation pinning and bow-out) is central to the  understanding of interfacial dynamics.  These  characteristics will be directly probed by measuring the  migration energy, formation energy, and activation volume of  the interfacial steps in expressly designed experiments  under a stress field or an electrical field and will be  complemented by additional structural and simulation studies  that focus on the atomistics of the step mechanism for  domain walls and phase boundaries. Three families of  prototypical ferroelectrics with a perovskite structure,  BaTiO3, Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3 (PZT) and Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PMN),  along with their various compositional and microstructural  modifications, will be investigated. For BaTiO3 and PZT type  of ceramics, which have a sharp transition at the Curie  temperature, Tc, the interest is primarily on the dynamics  of domain walls below Tc. For PMN type of ceramics, which  have a broader permittivity peak with the actual transition  diffuse and well below the temperature of maximum  permittivity (Tmax), the studies will be directed to the  dynamics of phase boundaries below Tmax.  Relaxation  spectroscopy  will be used to measure activation energy and  activation volumes of mobile interfaces, which can be  conveniently performed using polarization relaxation at  small field and stress relaxation at large field.  To lend  further insight into the atomistic mechanisms that affect  polarization reversal and interface mobility, synchrotron x-  ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) studies and Monte-Carlo  lattice simulations will be conducted. These investigations   will be carried out for both model ferroelectrics and their  modifications to delineate the broader effects of chemistry,  defect, and nanostructure that can influence interfacial  dynamics by either providing obstacles to interface motion  or by altering the mobility of the interface itself. The  goal of the research is to provide a unified and detailed  understanding, from the viewpoint of interface dynamics, of  various interface-controlled ferroelectric, ferroelastic and  piezoelectric phenomena that have broad implications to the  performance and long-term reliability of ferroelectric  ceramics as devices.  %%%  The goal of the research is to provide a unified and  detailed understanding, from the viewpoint of interface  dynamics, of various interface-controlled ferroelectric,  ferroelastic and piezoelectric phenomena that have broad  implications to the performance and long-term reliability of  ferroelectric ceramics as devices.
