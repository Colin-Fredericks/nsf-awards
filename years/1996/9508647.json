Many of the bees in this genus are solitary but other species show varying degrees of social behavior.  It is believed that eusociality has arisen and possibly reversed several times within the genus but the number of times is in dispute.  The phylogeny obtained by this study will be utilized to address questions of sex ratios and reproductive behaviors involved in the origins of eusociality as well as the distribution of social and presocial behaviors among the various lineages in the genus Lasioglossum.   %%%  This research will contribute to our knowledge of the biological diversity of a large genus of bees in the family Halictidae.  These insects are important pollinators, in general, including being the primary pollinators for certain crops like alfalfa.  The information on relationships among species and species groups in the genus Lasioglossum will be used to test basic research hypotheses about conditions related to origins of social behavior in insects.  ***",
