These   programs will strengthen the links between industry and academia and identify and   encourage new avenues of research in the mathematical sciences. The University-Industry   Postdoctoral Research Fellowships provide two years of support for recent recipients of   doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of contributing   to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. The postdoctoral fellow will   work closely with scientific advisors from both academia and industry.   The postdoctoral fellow will work under the direction of Satoshi Hamaguchi at   IBM and Yuefan Deng at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. The research   concerns the study of deposition and etching of thin films, focusing on atomic scale   phenomena. This activity involves modeling and simulation. The use of parallel   computation is expected to improve the number and length of simulations to provide a   better understanding of the phenomena.",
