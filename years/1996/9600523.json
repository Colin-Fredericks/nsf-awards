 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600523  Royer  The overall goal of the proposed research is to provide  fundamental, new knowledge about the physical mechanisms by  which small globular proteins of particular sequence adopt a  particular three-dimensional structure characterized by a  particular fold, stability and function.  The proposed  research will take advantage of the slow folding kinetics  and depressed freezing point of water which are unique to  the pressure perturbation approach.  High hydrostatic  pressure will be combined with a variety of physical  chemical measurements (fluorescence, infrared spectroscopy  and small angle x-ray scattering) on two model proteins,  staphyloccocal nuclease and apomyoglobin, to address the  following issues fundamental to protein folding.  i.) The  nature of the transition state in protein folding ii.)  Molten globule intermediates of protein folding iii.)  Characteristics of cold denaturation.  %%%  These high pressure studies using a combination of  spectroscopic techniques will provide unique and fundamental  information about protein folding unavailable from  alternative perturbation approaches.  This is because the  effect of pressure is to slow down the folding and unfolding  process by several orders of magnitude.  Given such slow  kinetics, measurements of structural properties can be made  on the timescale of minutes rather than nano to  microseconds, providing kinetic profiles using techniques  which are extremely difficult to apply to the much shorter  timescales that characterize folding at atmospheric  pressure.  This approach will yield structural information  about the transition state and kinetic information about the  multiple states in the folding pathway of apomyoglobin.  A  second unique advantage of high pressure stems from the  unusual phase diagram of water, which remains liquid to -20  C at 2kbar of pressure, allowing for the direct observation  of cold denaturation at high pressure using all of the above  mentioned physical techniques.  The phenomenon of co ld  denaturation, the kinetics and characteristics of molten  globule intermediates and the nature of the rate limiting  step in folding remain among the least well characterized  aspects of protein folding and stability.  ***",
