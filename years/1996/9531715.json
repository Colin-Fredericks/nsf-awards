 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of undergraduate  students in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program offered  by Northern Arizona University. Students chosen for this program will  be Native American, African American and Hispanic students primarily;  Caucasian students who are the first generation for their family in  college may be included as participants. Under the guidance of  scientists from the Department of Biological Sciences and the  Department of Psychology, students will conduct research in the neural  and behavioral sciences. The program is a year-long research internship  that integrates four major components. (1) Students receive formal  training in research design and statistics, reading complex scientific  literature, and an integrated lecture-discussion series that covers the  range of research topics in neural and behavioral sciences. (2) This  training phase is combined with research experience under the guidance  of faculty mentors during the summer and the academic year. (3) A  seminar on professional issues held during the Fall semester will  assist students in clarifying their career goals, instruct them in  applying to graduate schools, and prepare them to make research  presentations. (4) An ethics component will include presentations on  the ethical treatment of animals in research, the ethical treatment of  human subjects, the history of science, and cultural issues in ethics.  Both faculty and students will attend presentations on Native American  cultural restrictions around the handling of certain animals and  plants.       This award will foster the continued education and training of  individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic  researchers in neural and behavioral sciences. It will also help to  inform young citizens about ethical questions in science and aspects of  management and decision making for solving some societal/environmental  problems.                                                            =~",
