 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of entrepreneurship in Hong Kong, administering a survey to a sample of 600 entrepreneurs.  It has three chief aims.  First, it seeks to provide empirical knowledge about who the entrepreneurs are in terms of social origins and demographics, what kinds of business activities they engage in, and how and why they engage in such activities.  Second, it will investigate how gender, ethnicity, and immigration status may affect entrepreneurial activities.  Third, it will inquire into the nature of business organization in Chinese family firms, especially those issues regarding management and ownership control, training and compensations, as well as to explore possible sources of variation across firms, in particular, whether firm size, ownership pattern, duration of operation, industrial sector, technological sophistication, and the persons in charge of operation (the original founders or their descendants) have any influence in organizational structures.  The collected data will allow systematic investigation of the differences and similarities among Hong Kong, China, and the United States in the social composition of entrepreneurs, factors that hinder or contribute to entrepreneurial activities, and types of entry strategies.  In addition, this survey will provide data to compare the organizational structures of Chinese family business firms with those found in the United States, utilizing data assembled in the National Organizations Survey.  %%%   This study will be done at a crucial time in the economic and social history of Hong Kong, immediately before custody of it is regained by the People's Republic of China.  Thus, the research will provide baseline data for understanding changes that may take place under a new and potentially different political and economic system.  Comparison of the results with those from existing studies of entrepreneurs in China and the United States will provide insights into the social sources of growth throughout the rapidly developing Pacific Rim.",
