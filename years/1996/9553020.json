 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  John J. Salzer  Wesleyan University        Galaxies that have active nuclei, or regions of intense starburst  activity,  represent  examples of the  most  energetic  phenomena  known  in  the universe.   Galaxian activity is very  common  and  occurs  on  all  scales,  from the super  luminous  quasi-stellar  objects  (QSOs),  down  to  the extremely  active  star-formation  regions in blue compact dwarf galaxies.  Much of our knowledge of  active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and starburst galaxies have come by  studying galaxies cataloged in objective-prism surveys which used  observations   by  Schmidt  telescopes  and  data   recorded   on  photographic  plates.   The opportunity  to  use  more  sensitive  charge coupled device (CCD) detectors to survey for emission-line  galaxies  now  exists,  and  initial observations  have  provided  results  that  have shown great promise to provide  better  data.  The  large, deep samples obtained from CCD-based Schmidt  surveys  will   provide  exciting  new  opportunities  to  study  galaxian  activity  of all types, and should allow us to better  understand  this activity in the context of galaxy formation and evolution in  general.    The  research  will involve carrying out the next  generation  of  objective-prism surveys for emission-line galaxies. The technique  to  be  used  combines  the  benefits of  a  traditional  Qchmidt  telescope survey with the advantages of using a CCD detector.  It  is  planned to survey several hundred square degrees of sky to  a  limiting  magnitude  of B = 20 - 21 over  the  next  five  years.  Computer software developed specifically for this program will be  used  to  automatically locate, extract, and classify the spectra  in  each field, and use pattern matching algorithms to select our  sample  of  emission-line galaxies.  An  initial  pilot  project,  carried  out  in  the  Spring  of 1994,  has  verified  that  our  technique  is  indeed capable of reaching the desired  magnitude.  It  is conservatively  estimated that 20-30 emission-line galaxies  will  be  found per square degree, roughly 200 times the  surface  density   of   the  galaxies  in  the  Markarian   survey.    The  emission-line    galaxy    candidates    will     be     observed  spectroscopically  using  a multi-fiber  spectrograph  to  obtain  redshifts and line strengths for the full sample.    The  results obtained from analyzing the data of this deep sample  of AGNs and star-forming galaxies will have numerous applications  to  the  study  of  galaxian  activity.   These  include:  global  star-formation  processes, chemical evolution  in  galaxies,  the  value  of  the primordial helium abundance, luminosity  functions  and  space  densities of AGN and actively star-forming  galaxies,  large-scale structure and observational cosmology.",
