 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shaw/Abstract           The objective of this research is large-eddy simulation (LES)  of the atmospheric surface layer in which the lowest portion of the  three-dimensional computational domain represents a plant copy such  as a forest.  The vegetation is represented by a foliage element  are density, a drag coefficient, and a sensible heat and water  vapor source or sink at each grid point within the canopy.  In the  LES, scales of motion resolved by the grid network are computed  directly in time-dependent form, while sub-grid-scale processes are  parameterized.         Our plan is to use the simulations to study the nature of  turbulence in the vicinity of plant canopies, and to apply the  technique to more realistic (such as inhomogeneous) situations.  We  will perform in-depth studies of coherent structures created within  the computed flow fields and follow them from inception to  dissipation (an impossible task in the field). Structures will  initially be detected using wavelet and other related techniques,  complemented by computer animation.  It is our aim to obtain as  complete a picture as possible of coherent structures developing at  the  interface between the lower atmosphere and a plant canopy.   The method of proper orthogonal decomposition will also be applied  to computed LES fields.         A complete thermal energy balance of the vegetation and of the  underlying soil will be incorporated into the model to more  correctly introduce soil evaporation, transpiration, and heat  storage in both soil and biomass.  The influence of aeroelastic  properties of the vegetation will also be introduced and a study  made of the phenomenon of honami.  As a demonstration of our  interests in this regard, we have begun an examination of the  windbreak problem.         All computation will be performed on the Cray Y-MP at the  National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).",
