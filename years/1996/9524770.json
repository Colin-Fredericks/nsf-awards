A realistic stochastic model of precipitation can be based   on meteorologically homogeneous weather states, each driving a simple   stochastic model of precipitation. In order to determine appropriate weather   states, a variant of canonical correlation analysis, appropriate for dependent   data, is developed.  Statistical theory allowing a space-time decomposition   of atmospheric fields with attendant standard error assessment is developed.  When applied to the leading canonical variates, such a method can isolate spatial   and temporal scales of interest. A slightly different approach uses a hidden   Markov model, driven by atmospheric data in a less explicit form than expressed   above. This model is fairly accurate on relatively small spatial scales, and for  temporally homogeneous parts of the year.  This hidden Markov model approach  is extended to a seasonal model, and its performance compared with the weather state approach, as well as with general meteorological forecast models.  %%%  The  general circulation models used to assess climate change have relatively  poor performance when it comes to precipitation. Furthermore, in order to  assess the effect on regional hydrology of climate changes, models with a finer  resolution than the circulation models are needed, since the hydrologic  processes usually operate on a much smaller scale than the large-scale  atmospheric processes that dominate the global climate models. Rather than  developing precise deterministic models of rainfall, the researchers build  a partly probability-based class of models, and compare it with  meteorological forecast models and applied to both weather data and circulation  model outputs.  ***",
