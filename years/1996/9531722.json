 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rodger  9531722  This award is for a study of several problems that will be  considered over the next three years.  Two of the problems will  take a major effort to  solve.  The first problem is to find  necessary and sufficient conditions for a given edge-colored copy  of the complete graph on n vertices (Kn) to be embedded in an  edge-colored copy of Kv in such a way that the subgraph induced  by the edges of each color form a connected spanning k-regular   subgraph of Kv.  This would be a companion to existing results  with either drop the requirement that the subgraphs are connected  or replace it with the requirement that they be 2-edge connected.  The second problem is to show that any partial Mendelsohn triple  system of order n and index l can be embedded in a complete  Mendelsohn triple system of order v and index l for some v not  exceeding 2n+1.  This is a directed version of Lindner's   conjecture, a conjecture which has now been proved for triple  systems of even index using amalgamation techniques.  This  progress in the undirected case suggests that the directed  analogue is ready to be solved.  Amalgamation techniques are of  interest in their own right, and warrant further study. Other  problems will be studied.  The investigator will consider the  graph H(C) naturally arising from a Hamming code C and attempt to  show that H(C) has a hamilton decomposition and is pan-cyclic.  The investigator also plans to make contributions to the growing  literature on graph designs.  This research is in the general  area of Combinatorics.  One of the goals of Combinatorics is to  find efficient methods to study how discrete collections of  objects can be arranged.  The behavior of discrete systems is  extremely  important to modern communications.  For example, the  design of large  networks, such as those occurring in telephone  systems, and the design of  algorithms in computer science deal  with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research.",
