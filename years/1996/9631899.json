It follows the 14th World  Conference on Nondestructive Testing (NDT)  being held in nearby New Delhi.  The co-  organizers are Arup Maji, University of New  Mexico and S.K. Kaushik, University of Roorkee.   The workshop will focus on the application of  diagnostic methods, including both established  techniques and emerging technologies, to cement  based composite materials.  Participants will  identify specific research areas in NDE that  would yield mutual benefit from Indo-US  collaboration.    Scope:  Roorkee is a leader  in concrete technology and India's premier  institution for Civil Engineering education and  research.  The workshop is locally co-sponsored  by the Indian Institute of Cement and host,  Roorkee University.  INT will provide airfare  for six U.S. participants including young  scientists and women.  Proceedings and summary  papers will be published in both countries.   ***",
