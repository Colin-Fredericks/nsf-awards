 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research project supported jointly by the Analytical and Surface   Chemistry Program and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program, Professor   Roberts and his coworkers will carry out basic studies of the chemistry   of ice and solid acid hydrate multilayers.  The effects of ice surface   structure on the catalyis of reactions of importance in stratospheric   chemistry will be examined.  In addition, the adsorption and reaction of   small molecules on solid sulfuric acid and sulfuric acid water solid   solutions will be explored. The mechanism of the heterogeneous nucleation   and growth of ice and acid hydrate layers will also be investigated.    Ultra high vacuum electron spectroscopic probes as well as reflection   absorption infrared spectroscopy will be applied to these studies.  The   information obtained in this research will be useful for developing an   understanding of the stratospheric chemistry which governs catalytic   ozone destruction, and will provide a basic understanding of the surface   chemistry of important molecular solids.  The chemistry of small molecules of atmospheric importance on the surface   of ice and solid acid hydrates forms the focus of this research project.   Adsorption and reaction of molecules such as HCl, HOCl, and HNO3 on ice   and solid sulfuric acid surfaces will be examined using electron   spectroscopy and reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy.  The   information obtained from these studies will be important in developing   an understanding of the chemistry leading to ozone depletion in the   stratosphere, and in our basic knowledge of infrequently studied   molecular solids such as ice and sulfuric acid.",
