The  workshop will consist of two meetings, one in Puerto  Vallarta, Mexico and the second one in the U.S. at the  Sevilleta Long-Term Ecological Research site at the  Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico.  The  primary objectives are to establish new collaborations  between researchers from the U.S. and Mexico and to open new  directions for international research.  Holding meetings at  the two sites will allow the participants to gain a much  better understanding of the ecological diversity represented  across the North American continent.  The second meeting  will be held a few months after the first to provide time  for consideration of discussions from the first meeting, and  facilitate better and more rapid proposal development at the  second meeting.    Variation and diversity are essential elements in the  maintenance of population, species, communities, ecosystems  and the entire biosphere.   Biological systems serve as a  buffer against dramatic change, and  are critical to  ecosystem maintenance, but despite this important function,  species are being lost and ecosystems altered at an ever  increasing rate. Much of the observed changes on local  scales are the results of larger scale problems, such as  global change. The solutions to these problems will require  international cooperation and research on multiple scales.  This project will contribute to the development of an  international network of scientists interested  in  researching these problems in the North American continent.  ***",
