 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  EEC-9525881  Persson    This award is to continue funding for the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Energetic Materials at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.  The main research focus of the Center is on the safety of energetic materials.  The quantities of these materials being manufactured, transported, stored, and used in the United States poses particular risks for mass explosion or detonation.  Other current research efforts are directed towards reducing the environmental effects of large explosions, fire hazards, and increased safety of energetic materials.  Specific research topics include detonation and shock initiation, development of small-scale tests to determine the hazards during development, manufacture, transportation, storage, and use of energetic materials, thermal hazards of energetic materials, safety engineering of energetic materials, minimum burning rates and pressures, and ignition energies.    Additional funding is provided in this award to support one undergraduate female student to conduct research performed on Project 3, Small Scale Safety Test Methods, in the Center.  The student will evaluate the relationship between the level of response of explosives samples tested in 40 mg samples and the reaction violence observed in large charges.",
