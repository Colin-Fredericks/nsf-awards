The investigator   will continue his research in interior point methods in order to seek answers   to several theoretical and practical issues  concerning these methods.     Particular issues include:  (1) developing workable and near optimal barrier   functions for general convex problems, (2) using any special property a   problem might have in order to construct barrier functions with additional   desirable properties, (3) developing efficient long--step interior point   methods by taking advantage of the properties of the underlying problem   and/or the barrier function, (4) computational testing of the developed   algorithms in order to gauge their performance and gain additional insight   into their behavior, and (5) developing new tools to analyze interior point   methods.    Many problems in industry can be formulated as large scale optimization   problems.  For example, many production, scheduling (such as airline crew   scheduling), planning problems, etc. can be formulated as linear programs.   The practical impact of interior point methods on such large scale linear   programs have been phenomenal.  This has been followed by similar   successes in linear complementarity problems, and more recently in semi--  definite programming.  The latter problems also have practical applications   in industry, engineering, economics, and in many hard problems in discrete   optimization. (Some of these applications have been unexpected, and can be   attributed to the practical success of interior point methods.)  Many other   industrial problems can be posed as convex programs.  At present, interior   point methods provide the theoretical promise to solve such problems   efficiently.  The investigator will perform research towards advancing   interior point methods in order to make this promise a reality.  These  advances will have a direct effect on our a bility to solve important large   scale industrial problems in manufacturing, planning, transportation,   distribution, and engineering.",
