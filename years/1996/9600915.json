 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600915  Goldsmith    The most important function of the individual in contributing to the maintenance of any biological species is reproduction.  In fact, all organ systems of any vertebrate organism function to maintain life to enable reproduction to occur.  In all mammalian species, reproductive success is critically dependent upon normal function of the ovary.  Normal production and secretion of specific steroid and protein hormones.  In the mammalian ovary, the oocyte is encased in several layers of cells which secrete the female sex steroid hormone estrogen.  At ovulation, the oocyte is extruded from the ovary and the calls which previously surrounded the oocyte are changed into a structure called the corpus luteum  The cells of the corpus luteum, the luteal cells, secrete the female sex steroid hormone, progesterone.  The secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum in the proper amounts for the proper time period is required for successful reproduction.  If circulating progesterone levels are too low or if secretion of the proper amounts occurs for too short of a time period, implantation of the fertilized oocyte will not occur or if implantation does occur, the pregnancy will not be maintained.  In the case of a nonpregnant cycle, if progesterone levels are too high, or secretion occurs for too long a time period, a subsequent ovulation will not occur.  Thus, progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum is a critical determinant of reproductive success.  The cells of the corpus luteum respond, through biochemical mechanisms, to blood born hormonal substances which control the normal secretion of progesterone.  The specific biochemical mechanisms which allow the luteal cells to respond to those hormones which control progesterone secretion are at present unknown.  It is, in fact, these mechanisms that are responsible for normal luteal function.  The PI has recently discovered that, in the rat, the amounts of a particular protein, the K-ras p21 protein, contained in the ovary mirror  the pattern of secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum.  Furthermore, when an antibody against this protein was incorporated into luteal cells in vitro, progesterone secretion from these cells was significantly decreased, thus demonstrating that this protein plays a role in the production/secretion of progesterone by the luteal cell.  It is the objective of this proposal to determine the specific way in which the K-ras p21 protein affects luteal progesterone secretion and to determine whether this p21 protein plays a role in the secretion of other hormones from the corpus luteum.  The K-ras p21 protein is present in all mammalian cells.  Thus, the results of the proposed studies will have a significant impact upon the understanding of ovarian hormone secretory mechanisms as well as understanding of the ways in which all mammalian cells respond to hormones and growth factors.",
