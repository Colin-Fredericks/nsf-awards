Accelerating this process efficiently with parallel computers is of  enormous practical significance, and is the focal point of the  proposed research.  Our specific objective will be to design and  test parallel simulation algorithms based on the balanced Border  Block Diagonal (BBD) decomposition, which is ideally suited for  mapping sparse matrix problems onto multiprocessor architectures,  and secures both good load balancing an low intercommunication  between the processors.         To significantly broaden the scope of the proposed parallel  transient stability simulation, well established epsilon  decompositions will be applied to sparsify the Jacobian that arises  in solving the discretized algebraic-differential equations by  Newton's method.  Preliminary results indicate that in electric  power systems very significant sparsification can be achieved by  discarding sufficiently small elements in blocks of matrices L and  U where the fill-in is substantial.  In this context, and  additional objective will be to develop algorithms for identifying  coherent groups of generators in large power networks via epsilon  decompositions of the Jacobian, which will be linear in complexity  and serve as a basis for transient stability computations.         The balanced BBD and epsilon decompositions offer a new  approach to the design of decentralized control of large power  systems.  The BBD structure will be used to parallelize the  solutions of Lyapunov and Riccati matrix equations, which are of  fundamental importance in the decentralized stabilization and  optimization of dynamic systems.  Initial experiments indicate that  this method can be used to stabilize very large systems with as  many as several thousand state variables.  ***",
