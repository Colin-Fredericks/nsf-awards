Recent studies of NGC 4258 have revealed that the masering  molecules lie in a thin annulus with inner and outer radii  about 0.14 and 0.28 pc, with maser emission seen from gas  along the line of sight to the center of the disk and also  along the \"tangent points\". The rotational velocity shows  that the gas follows a Keplerian rotation curve with a  binding mass (presumably a black hole) of 36 million solar  masses. A survey of active galaxies which is about half done  has already discovered nine new examples (five were known  before). The survey will be completed and a statistical  analysis made of the total maser sample. The new masers will  be mapped with the VLA, and with VLBI for the brighter  examples, and monitored for the redward drift of features  seen in NGS 4258; if it is seen, it allows the centripetal  acceleration, and thus the binding mass, to be measured  directly. In addition, a survey of radio galaxies for  water vapor emission will check theoretical prediction that  very luminous water vapor maser emission exists.",
