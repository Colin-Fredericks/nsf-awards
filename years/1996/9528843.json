 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Carpenter at   Cornell University is investigating fundamental organic dynamics using   theoretical and experimental chemistry. The theoretical portion deals   with calculation of molecular trajectories in an effort to to determine   the lifetimes of reaction intermediates. The hypothesis is that short   lived species may have kinetic characteristics which are new and not   adequately described by existing theory. In the experimental portion of   the investigation, the principal investigator is testing this hypothesis   using pericyclic systems with isotope labeling and supercritical fluid   media. Stereoselectivity of reaction products is  the preferred end point   analysis for testing the new concept.  In order to generalize the use of chemical reactions in a rational way,   it is necessary to understand the reaction pathway in detail. While the   chemical community has had a paradigm for many organic reactions, this   proposed work challenges these traditional concepts and has preliminary   data to support the new concepts. If successful, this investigation could   have profound significance for understanding of chemical reactions.",
