This project aims to study  the extension of this invariant to a holomorphic function of the parameter.  Following work of Murakami, Ohtsuki, Rozansky and the Principal  Investigator, it is currently possible to define such an extension only for  specific manifolds.  The goal of the project is to understand better the  relationship between this function, specific values that it takes, its  asymptotic expansion, and a combinatorial description of the geometry and  topology of the original manifold.  This should lead to combinatorial  formulae for finite type 3-manifold invariants, generalizations of the  Casson invariant, as well as a discretization of the Chern-Simons-Witten  Feynman integral and comparisons with the Kontsevich integrals.       Although much is known about the so-called quantum family of  invariants of knots and links in three dimensions, which are generally  polynomial functions of a complex parameter, the same is currently not true  for their 3-manifold counterparts.  From the few known results on these  functions, they are seen to have intriguing number theoretic properties,  the investigation of which is the subject of this project.  These  invariants also have a formulation as a Feynman integral, and it is hoped  that this project will contribute to the better understanding of Feynman  integrals in general, which currently sit on a not entirely rigorous  foundation.  ***",
