 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632141  Johnson  This is a theoretical program consisting of two parts:  to study  the fundamental properties of integer and fractional quantum Hall  effect (QHE) and to study nonlinear mesoscopic transport.  More  specifically, in the first part there will be a study of the rich  ground states and transitions as a function of magnetic field in  small quantum dots,  using  a previously developed ensemble  density functional method which will be extended to include spin  degrees of freedom and current distributions.  Further  applications of this method include  a study of the off-diagonal  long range order in the fractional QHE and detailed properties of  the composite fermion.  In the nonlinear mesoscopic transport,  there will be a comparative study of a formalism developed by the  PI's and the traditional approaches such as nonequilibrium  Green's function with possible application to the second harmonic  generation in quantum wires.  %%%  In this grant supporting collaborative theoretical research by  the two young PI's, the main focus is on two subjects:  properties of  layers of electrons subjected to intense magnetic  fields, a subject referred to as quantum Hall effect and on  response of small devices  to intense radiation.  Both of these  projects involve special theoretical techniques  developed by  these PI's.  ***",
