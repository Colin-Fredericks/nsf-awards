 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to establish controlled environment space at the Pymatuning  Laboratory of Ecology, a center for ecological studies administered by the  Department of Biological Sciences of the University of Pittsburgh. With  four new appointments in Ecology, plans for additional appointments in the  near future, a five-year program of research land purchases, the  construction of new research and residential buildings discussions of new  programmatic initiatives in Environmental Science, and generous funding  packages for the four new ecology faculty since 1993, the University has  demonstrated a long-term commitment to building the Pymatuning Laboratory  of Ecology into a superb ecological research and education center.  Controlled environment space at the Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology will  fill a critical need in the growing program. The active and growing group  of scientists and educators at PLE will ensure ample use and productivity  from this investment.    The controlled environment space will consist of three 15 ft2 controlled  environment chambers, capable of providing a wide range of temperatures.  light levels and humidifies; a germination/incubation chamber, and a  control system which allows remote monitoring and programming of the  environmental control systems. Matching, funds from the University of  Pittsburgh will provide partial coverage of the cost of chamber purchase.  preparation space. modifications of the building climate control system and  electrical system, purchase of the computer and communications hardware for  interfacing with the remote programming and monitoring system and purchase  and installation of a water purification system.    Five user groups propose specific research for controlled environment  space. This research includes 1 Propagation of distinct allocation  genotypes in Plantago ianceolata for examination of the role of genetic  variation in carbon and nitrogen :allocation patterns for fitness variation  under elevated atmospheric carbon concentration . 2 Controlled matings of  field-collected Arabis Ivrata for use in studies of the genetic  architecture of local evolution. 3. Estimates of mating, systems for four  populations of Collinsia verna to determine the evolutionary liability of  mating system parameters in natural populations.  4. Studies of seed bank  demography in natural populations of Collinsia verna to understand the  population genetic and demographic consequences of near-extinction in  natural populations. 5. Manipulation of phenological state in  wild-collected Fragaria virginiana plants to examine genetic variation in  gender expression and floral display and its fitness consequences.. 6.  Production and diapause manipulation of phytophagous insects for  dose-response curves of herbivory on competitive ability in field  populations of plants. 7. Clonal propagation of wild-collected genotypes  Solidago altissima differing in allocational patterns for use in field  studies of selection on allocation as a proximal  mechanism for selection  on competitive ability. In addition to these major user groups. ;l  substantial number of researchers from small colleges in the surrounding  area have a commitment to work ~ Phymatuning and would make occasional use  of controlled environments. The requested controlled environment space  would also be a strong asset to Phymatuning Laboratory s successful  teaching program    Tonsor the new director of the Phymatuning Laboratory of Ecology, will be  responsible for the administration of the controlled environment space. A  committee will be established, initially consisting of the heads of the  listed use, groups. to make policy and space assignment decisions. The cost  of maintenance will be recovered from bench fees charged for use of PLE,  laboratory fees for courses using the space, grant overhead return funds,  and new increment to the general operating budget of the Phymatuning,  Laboratory of Ecology.",
