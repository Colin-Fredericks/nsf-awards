 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634270  Past efforts to apply TQM techniques to construction  engineering and management have not been successful due to  the dissimilarity between the areas of manufacturing and  industrial engineering to construction engineering and  management.  This proposal suggests that the area of  construction engineering and management needs immediate  information feedback techniques such as those developed for  manufacturing and process engineering.  The competitive  environment of the construction industry urges the necessity  to know current status of budgets, quantities, materials,  procurement, and crew locations.  As technology has  increased, the ability to track money, time, and materials  has also increased through the use of scheduling,  estimating, and database software.  There remains the  problem of a significant time delay between events and  knowing the status of those events.  This research will  adapt TQM techniques to the construction industry to achieve  immediate information feedback and event status.  It will  identify events in the construction industry in which  immediate information is highly desirable, as well as  methods to achieve immediate feedback.  finally, this  research will develop a plan by which to realize actual  immediate feedback techniques in the construction industry.",
