 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims at developing a unified statistical framework for  nonlinear signal processing for communications by using a recent extension  of maximum likelihood estimation, the maximum partial likelihood (MPL)  estimation theory, which allows for dependent and missing observations, and  sequential processing of data using only the information that is available  at the time of processing.  Previous research has established the  theoretical foundation for the statistical analysis of MPL estimation with  a general nonlinear probability model and provided a very useful  information theoretic connection.  The inclusion of the dependent data in  the framework allows addressing of problems in coding and modulation in the  presence of sources and channels with memory.  This research includes  development of a new class of realtime adaptive signal processing  algorithms based on MPL estimation by using gradient optimization and  information theoretic alternating projections, and the study of their  statistical and dynamic properties and implementations in specific  communications applications such as equalization in long distance optical  fiber communications and voiced/unvoiced/transition classification in  variable rate speech coding.  Another important part of the effort is the  investigation of the choices for the conditional probability model within  the MPL framework, for which, along with other nonlinear models, such as  polynomials, finite normal mixtures, and neural networks, piecewise linear  models are used to provide a highly desirable compromise between the  approximation ability of nonlinear structures and the efficiency and  theoretical accessibility of the linear domain to develop new adaptive  algorithms.  The techniques which result from this work are very likely to  lead to breakthroughs in realtime signal processing for communications via  new algorithms with superior performances and in the general theory of  nonlinear techniques in communications via rigorous treatment of t he  underlying dependent time series problems.",
