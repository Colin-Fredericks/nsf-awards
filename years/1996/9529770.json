 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this work, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program   in the Chemistry Division, Robin L. McCarley of Louisiana State   University, Baton Rouge, will study ways to modify self-assembled   monolayers (SAMs) on an in place basis.  A major thrust of the project is   to use electrochemical polymerization to manipulate reactions in SAMs to   produce surfaces with specific properties.  The chemistry uses conducting   thin film poly(pyrrole) polymers produced from substituted alkyl thiols   attached to gold surfaces.  A number of instrumental methods will be used   to study the films that are produced.  One, attenuated total internal   reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, is particularly   useful because it produces information about the chemical composition of   the surface of the material.  Scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning   force microscopy are to be used to provide information about surface   topography and structure.  The objective is to correlate macroscopic   properties of the thin film materials with molecular structure.   This investigation will study ways to control the chemistry involved in   the formation of organic thin films constructed on gold surfaces which   serve as a physical support for the film.  The purpose is to produce film   materials with physical and chemical characteristics tailored to a   specific application.  In the long term, this will enable construction of   sensors for environmental monitoring and other purposes which have high   molecular specificity.",
