 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511125  Inman and Haughwout    Investment in public infrastructure has become one of significant  policy concern.  The two central questions addressed by the proposed  research agenda are:         1) Do we have a public infrastructure crisis?       2) If so, what government actions, including incentives, can best          encourage appropriate types and levels of expenditures on                public infrastructure?    First, to address the crisis question, the researchers identify the  benefits of public infrastructure investment.  Does public structure  investment increase the income of individuals and businesses in the  impacted area or not?  The researchers expect that positive benefits  from public infrastructure investment will accrue to large urban areas  and negative benefits to rural areas.  As a result of these possible  offsetting effects, uniform government policies to encourage  infrastructure investment will have zero impact on productivity and  income for the country as a whole.  If their predictions are  confirmed, government policies need to be carefully formulated to  differentiate between large urban and rural areas.  The benefits of  public structure infrastructure on individual households are examined,  by considering the impact of such investment on housing prices and  local labor markets.    Second, the researchers will look at the effect of federal tax and  grants policies on state and local public infrastructure expenditures.   Their proposed research recognizes that elected-body officials at the  state and local level will vote-trade or be willing to favor another  official's program in return for support of their own favored program.   An analysis of state and local public infrastructure decisions  capturing such behavior will hopefully allow for better design of  federal programs.",
