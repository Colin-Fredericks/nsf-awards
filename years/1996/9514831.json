 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an extensive sociolinguistic investigation of  Cajun French. The study will use a scientific methodology based  on a large and diverse enough sample of speakers to enable  researchers to access the range of variability of the Cajun  speech community. The results will provide the basis for answers  about the real usage of, the linguistic attitudes toward, and the  structure of this variety, and, consequently, its degree of  assimilation. The goal is to determine what Cajun French is in  Louisiana today, who uses it, when, with whom and to what end.  Two major objectives will be achieved by this project. The first  is the delimitation and definition of four Cajun communities  (Thibodaux, Abbeville, Eunice and Marksville), as well as the  linguistic attitudes of the inhabitants. To achieve this, a  stratified sample of 1200 individuals representing these four  communities will be constructed which will allow access to socio-  economic and geographic diversity, and a sociological  questionnaire will be distributed to specific categories of  respondents. This will allow researchers to examine linguistic  attitudes about identity and belonging. By assessing four  sociolinguistic indices (linguistic competence in Cajun, Cajun  ancestry, network of Cajun use, and use of standard French), they  will also evaluate the sociolinguistic stability of Cajun French.  The second objective is the analysis of the Cajun language spoken  by native or near-native members of the four communities. To  highlight its specific nature, several linguistic forms which are  strongly stigmatized or otherwise marked will be studied. The  tokens will be drawn from a spoken Cajun French database designed  to allow statistically valid results representative of the four  linguistic communities.        By accounting for the social and cultural aspects of the  sociolinguistic situation of Cajun French the results will help  investigators understand the evolution and maintenance of this  non-standard variety, which is  confronted with both the  school-taught standard French held up as a linguistic model and  with cultural and linguistic encroachments by the majority  Anglophone society. The proposed study will have a significant  impact by providing both documentation and interpretation of an  extensive linguistic corpus and of statements by Louisiana French  speakers concerning their cultural/linguistic experience.  Finally, the results of this comprehensive analysis will  contribute to debates on norms, on language planning and on the  standardization of non-standard varieties.",
