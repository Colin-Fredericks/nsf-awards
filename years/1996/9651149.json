 "awd_abstract_narration": "In view of the growing evidence that passive listening is an inefficient way to learn physics, this project is developing new hands-on learning experiences in modern and traditional optics. Both of these closely related topics are of increasing technological importance and can play a significant, positive role in the training of public school teachers. In particular, this project involves two major developments:  a self-contained laboratory course in modern optics and a concomitant design change of the traditional optics lecture and laboratory courses, aimed at prospective teachers, which will emphasize interactive learning and conceptual understanding. The Physics and Astronomy Department is particularly well positioned for this project since it houses the teacher certification program of general science majors. This project also is developing collaborations with high school teachers, resulting in an integrated and enhanced program in optics consisting of two theory courses, two laboratory courses, and a facility for undergraduate research projects.   The new modern optics laboratory course includes seven regular experiments and three undergraduate research projects emphasizing concepts, related theory, measurements, and technological applications. The lab is being equipped with lasers, optical components, and optical and electronic instruments. This course provides a glimpse into the richness of laser physics beyond its visual aesthetics.   The experience gained through the lab course can prepare students for directed undergraduate research projects and for employment in optics-related industries. This course also exposes in-service and preservice teachers to important concepts in modern optics and helps diffuse these concepts to students in public schools. The significance of this course cannot be overemphasized at a time when the optical fiber is in the information network, optical computers are on the horizon, and electronics is giving way to photonics.",
