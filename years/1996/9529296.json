 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529296  Kyu  This primary objective of the present project is to  elucidate phase equilibria and self-organization behavior of  crystallizable polymer blends containing rigid-rod  molecules. To account for the coupling of phase separation  and mesophase ordering, they have combined Flory-Huggins  theory for isotropic mixing and Maier-Saupe theory for  nematic ordering of binary nematic mixtures by taking into  consideration the two orientational order parameters having  two nematic-isotropic transitions.  Customarily, the effect  of molecular orientation has been ignored in the  conventional thermodynamic or kinetic theory of  crystallization of flexible homopolymers, although it has  been generally known that flexible molecules indeed align  among themselves during chain folding.  They will  incorporate the effect of chain orientation on the  crystallization which is missing in the current  crystallization theory of flexible homopolymers.  The  coupling between crystallization kinetics and phase  separation dynamics of rigid-rod mixtures will be  investigated by time-resolved scattering.  %%%  This is an important proposal that raises the potential for  incorporating various theoretical predictions from different  families of materials into a coherent picture with  particular emphasis in advanced polymer and blends.  ***",
