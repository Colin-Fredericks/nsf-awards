 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of new catalysts for enantioselective reactions.  Chiral phosphines and chiral derivatives of dimethylaminopyridine will be evaluated as enantioselective acylation catalysts, as well as sulfonation and phosphorylation catalysts.  The emphasis will be on reagents that can be used under conditions of cooperative catalysis.  Procedures that allow simultaneous catalysis by a chiral nucleophile and by a Lewis acid will be investigated, and amplification of selectivity via sequential stages involving chiral catalysts will be explored.  Techniques that provide rapid access to chiral phosphines will be studied, including enantioselective protonation of phosphorous-stabilized anions, use of inexpensive chiral subunits that allow synthesis of enantiomerically pure phosphines via diastereomer separation, and asymmetric transformation techniques.  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Edwin Vedejs of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin.  Professor Vedejs will focus his work on the development of practical catalysts for the preparation of chiral substances in enantiomerically pure form which is of great importance in the synthesis of compounds of biological and industrial interest.  Emphasis will be placed on main group reagents, such as phosphorus and nitrogen-based reagents, and non-toxic metal ions to minimize disposal problems in potentially large scale applications.",
