 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530314  King    This  project  combines theory and experiment in a study  of  the  effects of free surfaces and triple junctions upon grain boundary  structure,  properties and behavior.  Traditional  approaches  to  grain  boundary properties rely on models that are  intrinsically  infinite,  and relatively little attention has been paid  to  the  effects   associated  with  the  non-infinite  extent   of   real  interfaces.  Calculations are made of the elastic fields of grain  boundaries  made  up of dislocation arrays in  finite  materials,  taking  into account surface relaxation effects.  The effects  of  free  surfaces  on the dislocations are considered  with  a  view  towards understanding how dislocations are eliminated from  grain  boundaries,  resulting  in  changes  of  misorientation.    These  effects  are also studied in polycrystalline films using  in-situ  transmission  electron microscopy experiments which are  compared  to  the  calculations.   The project  includes  a  study  of  the  properties    and    behavior   of   triple   junctions    within  polycrystalline  materials.  For certain  classes  of  materials,  notably  thin  films, triple junctions may fall  into  restricted  symmetry  classes in which the anisotropy of the  grain  boundary  energy  exerts a controlling influence on the morphology  of  the  triple line.  An attempt is made to demonstrate that these triple  junctions embody strain fields and excess elastic energies  which  depend  upon  the  misorientations of  the  grain  boundaries  in  calculable  ways.  This represents a new approach to triple  line  studies.  %%%  The   overall  thrust  of  this  project  is  to  study  how  the  terminations  of  grain boundaries affect  their  properties  and  behavior.   This is important in polycrystalline thin films  used  in   electronic   applications   and   in   the   properties   of  nanocrystalline materials.  ***",
