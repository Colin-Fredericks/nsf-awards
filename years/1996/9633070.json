 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633070  Denny                                   Disturbance plays a central role in  non-equilibrium theories of community structure, in which  high species diversity and species coexistence are  attributed to processes of stochastic recruitment in a  heterogeneously perturbed, patchy environment.  The  disturbance regime of the rocky intertidal system offers  an advantage for study in that it is characterized by  chronic high intensity physical disturbance due primarily  to a single factor -- the hydrodynamic forces imposed by  wave action. This controlling nature of \"wave exposure\" is  one reason the intertidal zone serves as a model system in  experimental ecology.               Dr. Denny's lab has recently been able to  combine the results of earlier work in wave statistics and  hydrodynamics with empirical measurements of the strength  of intertidal organisms in a quantitative, biomechanical  method that predicts physical disturbance as a function of  time and the \"waviness\" of the sea. Preliminary  applications of this approach have shown that its  predictions are reasonably accurate, but a rigorous test  of the approach has not been conducted, which is the  impetus for this project.               Extensive field measurements will be  conducted of the parameters that serve as inputs into the  biomechanical approach, and these data will be used to  predict the week-to-week rate of disturbance of each of  six representative species of plants and animals at a  series of sites along the shore. These predictions will  then be compared to the rates of disturbance measured  empirically at these same sites. The goodness of fit  between prediction and empirical measurement can then be  calculated to provide evidence of the overall predictive  ability of the biomechanical approach.                                                                          The  inexpensive instruments developed in these studies will make it possible for  intertidal ecologists to repeat the basic steps of this approach  (measuring  maximal wave height, measuring habitat-specific maximal water velocities), and  thereby should facilitate the use and testing of the biomechanical method at a  wide variety of sites.  If these tests of the biomechanical approach confirm its  ability to predict species-specific rates of disturbance, the method can be a  valuable tool for understanding the ecological consequences of both seasonal and  year-to-year variability in wave exposure, and for the prediction of how rates of  disturbance will change if large-scale climatic change causes longterm shifts in  the waviness of the ocean.",
