 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Component  Photorealistic image synthesis is an important problem for such  diverse fields as architecture, lighting and industrial design,  scientific visualization, simulation systems, entertainment, and  advertising.  An important component  that has been missing from  image synthesis  is the effect of weathering.  Existing models of  materials  in computer graphics assume that the materials are in  pristine condition.  This research program will focus on the  development of computer graphics techniques for modeling and  rendering weathered materials.    The research will proceed along four lines.  The first part of  the program involves the development of comprehensive material  models; and emphasis will be placed on models that can capture  the changing appearance of a given material over time.  The  second part of the program will entail the development of new  high-level representations for complex surfaces.  The third  aspect of the program includes creation of techniques simulating  the effects of the environment in both batch and interactive  modes.  The final stage involves developing techniques to render  weathered materials.    Educational Component  The pursuit of an integrated collection of educational  initiatives is an important goal.  The education plan proposes  the development of interactive pedagogical aids to augment  traditional classroom teaching, adaptive hypertext environments  for on-line student assistance, and interactive challenge-  response tools for student evaluation and certification.  Advanced courses in computer graphics are being developed using  these tools.  Mentoring and training of new researchers will  integrate the research and educational activities.    The principal investigator's track record of interdisciplinary  work, combining expertise in architecture and computer science,  will facilitate the work.  ***",
