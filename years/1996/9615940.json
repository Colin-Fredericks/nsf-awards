The conference will bring together physicians, scientists,  and biomedical engineers working on various aspects of  cardiovascular related research and practice.  An  International Advisory Committee of distinguished  investigators from 42 countries will contribute to the  planning of the conference program and the conduct of the  meeting.  The meeting is to include both podium and poster  presentations.  Plenary lectures will be given by experts on  topics of general interest to the multidisciplinary  participants and state-of-the art review papers will be  presented by world-class experts at the start of each  session. Of  significance to the development of the field of  biomedical engineering is the inclusion in the conference of  a student paper competition with certificates and cash  prizes planned.    Abstracts of presentations will be published. Publication of  a series \"Advances in Cardiovascular Sciences\" is planned  following the conference.  Conference presenters will be  invited to submit full papers as book chapters.  ***",
