 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efforts to increase the number of women in science have met unexpected difficulties, despite  great efforts and good intentions.  Why this failure?  A varied array of literatures has offered  tentative answers to this question, but conceptual and institutional rifts between approaches have  made it difficult to assemble ideas and findings into a consistent explanation.  For example,  historical studies have examined the lives of women scientists within the contexts of institutions  that have held them at arm's length; sociological studies have uncovered women's limited access  to the means of scientific production; research in the life sciences has shown how science has  studied women; feminist theories of science have examined how gender shapes science and  science education; and natural scientists themselves have shown how gender analysis has yielded  new research insights.  To date these rich and suggestive fields of study have not been drawn  together into dialog with one another.  The central purpose of this project is to develop  such a dialog, within the framework of a book, and to illustrate how foundational questions from  the areas of study interact with one another.",
