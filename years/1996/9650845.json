 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will provide a prototype for the modernization of the sophomore/junior level quantitative analysis laboratory course. The goals of the laboratory course are first, to demonstrate principles taught in lecture, and second, to teach laboratory technique emphasizing precision and accuracy. The traditional laboratory course either emphasizes precision and accuracy by using single-component samples or demonstrates modern techniques by using naturalistic (non-analyzed) samples. This project will integrate the two goals by utilizing an analyzed complex matrix for student samples, lypholized clinical control serum, as a multicomponent sample to simulate situations likely to be found by graduates in analytical laboratories.  Significant features of the chosen sample matrix include (1) a large variety of substances which have been analyzed by the manufacturer, including ions, neutral molecules, proteins, and enzymes; (2) the need for preanalytical separation and/or masking of interferents in some analytical schemes; (3) the opportunity for kinetic analyses; and (4) a wide range of concentrations of different analytes in a single sample. Other features of the experiments to be developed include computer-aided data acquisition and reduction.   The project will be carried out in three phases: (1) the laboratory exercises will be developed and tested using students at UCA; (2) chemistry faculty from other universities will attend a workshop to learn the specific laboratory exercises and test some of the exercises the next year in their quantitative analysis courses; (3) the investigators will write a laboratory guide for the experiments, using the accumulated knowledge of the classroom experiences.   Anticipated student outcomes of the project include improvement of comprehension in the classroom of problems involving complex analyses, an increased enthusiasm for analytical lab-work, and a greater familiarity with the principles behind simple automated instrumentation.",
