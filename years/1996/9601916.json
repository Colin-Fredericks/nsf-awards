 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gordon  9601916      The functioning of the nervous system depends on an intricate  network of connections between cells.  Much of the communication  occurs at tiny physical contacts between cells called synapses.   Learning and memory are thought to involve changes in the strength  of the communication through collections of synapses.  It is  therefore important to understand how synapses are built and  function by dissecting them into their component molecules.  A well  defined model system for this research is the neuromuscular  junction, a large isolated synapse between a motor neuron and a  muscle fiber.  Several molecules identified originally at the  neuromuscular junction have now been found at synapses throughout  the nervous system, suggesting common molecular mechanisms  underlying synapse formation and maintenance.  Dr. Gordon  identified chondroitin sulfate, a carbohydrate component found  attached to molecules on the muscle cell surface, plays important  roles in the molecular organization and development of the synapse.   Further studies are examining the role of chondroitin sulfate in  both the structure of the synapse and in signaling required for  synapse formation.  The studies provide an exciting opportunity to  identify new components of the synapse and to gain enhanced  understanding of the mechanisms governing communication between  nerve cells in the brain.",
