Elucidating the roles of bacteria is thus essential to       understanding the structure and functioning of marine       ecosystems, particularly with respect to the role of marine       biota in sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide. A new       epifluorescence, DNA staining method has revealed that       bacterioplankton can be divided into two groups of cells:       those with, and those without, visible nucleoids (as       visualized by the method). Preliminary work suggests that       cells with visible nucleoids (NV cells) represent the       component of the bacterioplankton assemblage that includes       both currently metabolically active and recently active       cells. Cells without visible nucleoids (non-NV) appear to be       inactive/dormant; however under appropriate conditions such       cells can develop visible nucleoids, thus non-NV cells must       contain DNA. In coastal bacterioplankton assemblages,the       fraction of NV cells (20 ~ - 60%), and of cells separately       identified as metabolically active (6% - 40%, was more       variable than total bacterial abundance. The ability to       identify the currently active + recently active portion of       bacterioplankton on a routine basis may provide exciting new       component can integrate the response of a bacterial       assemblage to environmental change over longer time scales       (days-weeks) than would the currently active fraction of the       assemblage (time scale of hours-days). In addition, the       ratio of currently active:NV cells is a potentially valuable       index of the growth state of NV bacteria. This project       represents a combined laboratory and field sampling program       to evaluate the implications of NV versus non-NV cells in       bacterioplankton  assemblages. Ideas to be examined include:       1) Non-NV cells can develop visible nucleoids by increasing       the amount of DNA/cell. 2) NV cells are subject to greater       grazing mortality compared to non-NV cells, which could       explain in part the persistence of inactive cells in       bacterioplankton. 3) The NV component of bacterioplankton       assemblages is more tightly coupled to indices of bottom-up       control (chlorophyll-a concentration, bacterial       productivity), and of top-down control (abundance of       nanoflagellates, rate of bacterivory) than is total       bacterial abundance in a coastal upwelling system. The       results of this research project should yield important new       insights concerning how marine bacterioplankton respond to       factors controlling their growth and biomass in the sea.       ***",
