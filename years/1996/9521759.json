 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521759  Fiedler        Tornadoes are recognized as one of the most violent, localized weather  phenomena.  Much progress has been made over the last several years in  understanding both the structure of tornadic thunderstorms and the dynamics of  tornado vortices.  There still, however, are unanswered questions as to the dynamics  of substructures contained within a tornadic vortex and the relationship between the  tornado s characteristics and the local environment.        In this research, tornadoes will be simulated using a very advanced  three-dimensional numerical model.   The model to be used is capable of continuous  dynamic grid adaptation and is ideally suited for resolving moving entities requiring   enhanced resolution in a relatively small region of the modeled domain.  The project  goal is to determine how the maximum wind speed in a tornado is related to  environmental conditions, such as convective available potential energy and radial  inflow at the base of the tornado.  The planned numerical simulations also will allow  a study of asymmetric vortex breakdown, instabilities, turbulent transport and  multiple vortices.          The results of this research should lead to a better understanding of the  especially violent substructures of tornadoes (e.g. satellite vortices) and eventually  enhance the ability to predict such phenomena.  ***",
