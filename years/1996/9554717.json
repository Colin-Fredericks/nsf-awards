 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on two week summer workshops (Summers 1996 and  1997) and follow-through activities during the following academic  year and summer on the integration of Ada as a software development  tool into all levels of the computer science curriculum.  The  workshop covers material on software engineering, the design and  development of Ada programs, techniques for integrating software  engineering and Ada into computer science courses, resources and  educational materials for using Ada in undergraduate courses,  hands-on lab activities using Ada, and the development of a  curriculum project which utilizes Ada.  The workshop contains a  significant laboratory component that is designed to complement the  lecture material and include classroom tested lab activities and  typical assignments.  The first week of the workshop emphasizes the  early portion of a typical computer science curriculum.  The topics  for this week are based on the traditional paradigm of structured  analysis and design.  The second week emphasizes the upper levels  of the computer science curriculum.  Object-oriented design and the  corresponding features of Ada 95 will be introduced and contrasted  to traditional software design and development.  Ada tasks will be  introduced as the basis for studying concurrent programming.   Graphics packages and the realtime aspects of Ada programming will  also be introduced.  The curriculum activities for the workshop  include (1) the proposal of a curriculum project to be completed  during the academic year following the workshop, (2) discussion  groups in which issues, assignments, and resources for using Ada in  an educational setting are explored, and (3) interaction with an  expert on using Ada in the computer science curriculum.  An  electonic follow-up session is planned in Fall 1997 following the  workshop to present and discuss completed curriculum projects and  to develop products and plans for the dissemination of results from  the curriculum projects.  Results wil l be presented in SIGCSE  forums",
