 "awd_abstract_narration": "Instrumentation requested in this proposal will provide a  comprehensive computer imaging and analysis system for use by the  faculty and students of Lawrence University in multiple research  projects. The proposed system will be based on a Macintosh  central processing unit (CPU) and will consist of software and a  number of peripherals that will allow for collection, storage,  analysis, and communication of experimental results. Such a  system will enable investigators in a biology and geology tm  utilize cuffing edge technology to enhance and extend existing  and planned research programs.        The CPU for the proposed system will have a 2GB harddrive  with 768MB RAM. A 21 inch high resolution color monitor will be  used with the CPU. A graphics card and DOS compatibility card  will be added to the CPU. Data collection peripherals will  include a digital color camera for field work and a CCD camera  for use with a compound and stereomicroscopes (these microscopes  will be dedicated for computer imaging use only), a flatbed color  scanner, a projection-slide color scanner, and a gel scanner.  Data storage peripherals will include a magneto-optical drive and  ten rewritable, magneto-optical cartridges. Various types of  software will be used for data collection and analysis as well as  communication of research results. Peripherals to be used for  production of various media for communication of research results  will include a projection slide printer, a laser printer, a  large-document color printer, and a photographic-quality color  printer.        Several investigators engaged in different types of  research would benefit from the use of a computer imaging system.  In biological research, applications will range from ecological  field studies to molecular biology. In ecological field studies,  digital image capture and morphometric analysis will enable  quantification of size and shape variations within Lake Winnebago  prey fish populations. In molecular biology applications,  densi tometry will be used to quantify the amounts of myosin mRNA  in wild type versus mutant C. elegans. Another research program  will use densitometry for quantification of gene induction in  chick embryos treated with the growth factor, bFGF. Additionally,  a number of future research applications will be possible, such-  as the use of morphometric analysis of histological preparations  from physiological research involving sex specific circadian  rhythms in crickets as well as from cell biological research  involving in vitro cell culture.        As is the case with biological research, the requested  equipment will have a wide variety of applications in geological  research. Applications will range from landscape to microscopic  scale. At the landscape scale, a specific use in ongoing research  will be to analyze satellite and aerial images to map the  distribution of late Quaternary landforms in eastern Wisconsin.  At the microscopic scale, computer imaging will be used to  quantitatively analyze microstructures in deformed rocks from the  upper midwest.",
