Current facility support  through the EAR/IF program (EAR-9304363) will  expire in early FY 97 and this grant will provide  an additional three years of support at an annual  level of approximately $275,000, which will  primarily be used as salary support for IRM  personnel including 5 senior personnel, support of  a post doctoral researcher and modest equipment  upgrades including upgrade of their  superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM), Mossbauer  spectrometer, Kappa susceptibility bridge and a  magnetic force microscope (MFM).  Funds will also  cover travel expenses associated with their  visiting fellows program and their advisory  committee and materials and supplies associated  with the production and distribution of their  quarterly newsletter and basic operations of this  facility.  The IRM has, over the last six years  under support from the EAR/IF program, established  a facility of state-of-the-art equipment used to  advance our knowledge of basic and applied rock  magnetism, for paleomagnetic research aimed at  unraveling earth system history and climatic  variability, and to gain further insight into  plate tectonic motions and the geodynamo.  Specific research has included studies of the rock  magnetic properties of Chinese Loess, the rock  magnetic characterization of remagnitized  Paleozoic strata in the Appalachians and the  craton interior, studies of biogenic magnetite and  examination of the fidelity of magnetic remanence.  With support for EAR/IF, the IRM makes available  these instruments at no charge to the earth  science community both with the U.S. and abroad.  ***",
