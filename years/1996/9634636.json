 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award to the University of Colorado at Boulder   supports the research of Professor Deborah S. Wuttke.  The research   focusses on the mechanism by which unstructured polypeptides fold into   protein structures.  The technique of time-resolved nuclear magnetic   resonance spectroscopy is employed for study in real time of the pathways   of folding and unfolding in ribonuclease A.  Through site-specifically,   isotopically labeled residues in the N-terminal region of ribonuclease A,   the study takes advantage of the ability of 1D nuclear magnetic resonance   spectroscopy to provide information on specific sites in a protein during   the course of folding and circumvents the difficulties of assignment and   resolution.  Each species is well-resolved, allowing the chemical shift   and crosspeak lineshapes, as indicators of local structural environment   and dynamical properties, to be followed throughout the entire kinetic   process.  The research is important in the fundamental understanding of protein   folding and the mechanism of formation of ribonuclease A, the protein   that catalyzes the cleavage of single-stranded ribonucleic acid in the   course of life-sustaining genetic processes.",
