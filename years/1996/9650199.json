 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed project seeks to integrate Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) technology into curriculum that is introductory in nature for the Manufacturing Technology student. Objectives are:  1. Upgrade the existing Production Laboratory to reflect the current state of automation processes in manufacturing.   2. Integrate manufacturing automation processes into the Technology Education (pre-service teachers), General Industry & Technology and Manufacturing Technology concentrations where CIM is part of the elective curricula rather than a requirement.   3. Improve the quality of undergraduate student research in manufacturing automation, materials testing, CAD/CAM, technology education and industrial technology through full-size machine tool technology.      By purchasing an electronic engine lathe, retrofitting an existing vertical mill and purchasing a new CNC controller for an existing NC lathe, the Production Lab will have the capability to introduce fundamental CIM technology to students in Manufacturing Technology concentrations, Technology Education, and General Industry & Technology in entry level courses.      The proposed project will upgrade existing laboratory facilities to include CIM technology with full-sized machine tools. Currently, students have access to CIM technology through table-top machines in elective courses. The project will facilitate the introduction of CIM concepts earlier in the curriculum, improve laboratory experience for pre-service technology teachers, be available for student research projects requiring full-size equipment and open an avenue for independent study requiring CNC lathe and mill projects.",
