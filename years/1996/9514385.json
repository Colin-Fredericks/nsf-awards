 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although considerable attention has been given to democratic processes in former communist and totalitarian states, a variety of processes also have been transforming attitudes toward and support for governments in nations that have long democratic traditions.  Political scientists and researchers in related field have used two theoretical perspectives to examine the sources of public support for democratic forms of government.  One is a `political culture` perspective, which emphasizes socio-cultural and political identities and public conceptions of democratic norms and values.  The other theoretical perspective is that of `political economy,` which focuses on national and personal economic conditions, the redistribution of wealth among individuals and groups, and judgments about the effectiveness and fairness of the political system in delivering a range of products and services.  These perspectives are used to examine the stresses currently affecting Canada through analyses of data gathered through a longitudinal series of surveys taken before and immediately after a referendum that will be held in late October 1995 to determine whether the province of Quebec should become an independent nation.  More than 1,000 Quebec residents and more than 1,150 residents of the rest of Canada will be interviewed over the phone and asked to complete a post-referendum survey.  The data gathered through these interviews and surveys will be compared with information gathered in Canada and other nations to assess the study the ways that different factors affect public support for political institutions in a mature democracy.   The results of this project will provide an excellent opportunity to explore the influence of socio-cultural and political economic factors on the form and stability of democratic governments.  Although focusing on the Quebec independence referendum, the data will complement a long-standing series of information gathered in other nations, thereby contributing to more generalizable knowledge.  Because the data collected through this study will be deposited in a number of public archives, they will be available to other investigators to use in testing other hypotheses regarding democratic processes and behavior.",
