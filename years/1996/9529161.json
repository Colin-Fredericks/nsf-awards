 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529161  RATNER       The Engineering Research Center for Engineered Biomaterials  (UWEB) at the University of Washington is established with the  primary objective to exploit specific biological recognition  mechanisms in order to develop new generation of biomaterials for  medical implants that will heal in the body in a facile,  physiologically normal manner.  A new generation of biomaterials  will be developed that can interact with specific cell receptors or  bind with appropriate proteins, and then initiate the desired  biological responses allowing control of healing.  Direct spin-offs  from this approach include affinity chromatography supports,  biosensors, nonfouling surfaces, manipulation of inflammation and  cell culture substrates.  An interdisciplinary team of materials  scientists, molecular and biologists, biomolecular engineers, and  physicians will collaborate in three independent thrust areas:  (1)  Design, synthesis and characterization of new molecular materials,  (2) Modulation of cell signaling to develop biomaterials that heal,  and (3) Medical application and healing.  The major knowledge  advancement will be mainly in the area of understanding the biology  of healing at the molecular level and consequently, on the ability  to manipulate the macrophage cells.  The technology advancement  will be the coupling of materials engineered at the molecular level  into macroscopic signaling system of the human organism which will  lead to radically different kinds of medical implants.  The UWEB  will begin with twenty seven sponsoring companies collaborating in  the research program and technology transfer activities.  Industry  will participate in research as resident technical fellows, and  will be involved in clinical research and testing which will not be  funded by the NSF award.  The Center will provide integrated  education and training in life sciences and engineering to the  graduate and undergraduate students through new courses, teaching  laboratories, and self-paced t utorials.  The University's K-12 and  High School Outreach Programs will be expanded to include the  activities of the UWEB.  The ERC will collaborate with the NSF  supported ECSEL Coalition Program.  ***",
