 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the present time interdisciplinary, field-based, courses for the training of environmental scientists are extremely rare; this is particularly true for the lower level of undergraduate education. As part of the new Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (BSES) program at Indiana University, an interdisciplinary field course for environmental scientists (G329) will be created that emphasizes site characterization, hydrogeology, and ecosystem analysis in addition to traditional geologic principles. A second course will be created through modification of an existing course for advanced geologic study (G429); the revised course (G429e) will include environmental components and place more emphasis on surficial geology. These new courses will utilize the Indiana University Geologic Field Station located in the Tobacco Root Mountains, Montana as their base for instruction. The new curriculum will consist of a combination of teaching exercises, independent evaluation exercises, and a Final Study Area project. Together, G329 and G429e constitute a sequence of field-based education open to students from other accredited colleges and universities. One unique aspect of the new curricula will be the utilization of an instrumented Demonstration Watershed for instructional purposes. The Demonstration Watershed will contain state-of-the-art monitoring equipment established as part of a cooperative effort involving Indiana University, State and Federal agencies, as well as the local water district and ranchers. In order to ensure dissemination of curricula materials we have proposed an on-site visitation program for external faculty members.",
