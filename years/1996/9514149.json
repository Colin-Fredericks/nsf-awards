 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514149  Mark    This U.S.-Bulgaria Cooperative Research award will study  \"Environmentally Friendly Manufacturing of Polymeric Materials  from Neutral Wastes.\"  The principal researchers are Dr. J. E.  Mark of the University of Cincinnati, and Dr. B. S. Fakirov of  Sofia University.  Theoretical developments indicate that  unusually good mechanical properties can be obtained by drying  swollen networks of semi-rigid chains while they are in the  deformed state.  This approach was recently demonstrated for  cellulosic esters and ethers and for some poly(n-  alkylisiocyanates), yielding increases in Young's modulus and  tensile strength by factors of 4 to 5.  The proposed study aims  at extension of these successful experiments to collagen in the  form of highly-degradable gelatin.  This material is particularly  suited for the development of such techniques for a number of  reasons, including: (1) possibility of production from natural  wastes using very mild processing conditions; (2) water  solubility; (3) biodegradability, with absence of pollution  problems; (4) low cost; and (5) consumability as a food product.   The expectation is to develop laboratory-scale technology for  manufacturing gelatin fibers and films with improved mechanical  properties potentially usable as commodity materials and goods.   Depending on the results obtained, an attempt could be made to  commercialize the optimized technology.    This research in chemistry fulfills the program objectives of  bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to  combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong  mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,  reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.    ***",
