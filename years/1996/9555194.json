 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal responds to the national need for  interdisciplinary science courses for nonscience students in  universities, colleges, community colleges, and adult  education centers.  The course will also be suitable for  meeting the science requirements of elementary/early  childhood education majors.It is proposed to create a new  undergraduate interdisciplinary course in which students  explore the key role of randomness in biology, chemistry,  physics, and earth science.  By placing the student in the  position of an independent investigator, it is hoped to  convey a feeling for \"what science really is\" to individuals  who may never enter scientific careers themselves.  A  version of these curriculum materials experiments,  simulations, and data analysis software has already been  developed as individual modules for high school science  classes.  These materials have been used successfully in  many schools, including suburban and urban high schools in  the Boston area and the classes of 35 teachers trained in a  two-week summer workshop.  These materials have also been  tested as part of a course for liberal arts undergraduates  and to augment existing physics, chemistry, and biology  courses.  These modules must now be recast into a coherent  one-semester course that is sufficiently challenging to  liberal arts undergraduates.  The significant feature of the  high school version, i.e.,  a balanced combination of hands-  on activities, experiments, and use of computers for  modelling and data analysis, will be retained.  However, new  topics will be incorporated, and those high school modules  that are retained will be upscaled in content,  will include  more challenging exercises, and will have a wider scope of  application.  More algebra will be incorporated into all  modules to allow deeper presentations of physics, chemistry,  and biology.  Preservice students will participate in the  development of course materials. Training workshops will  assist interested faculty from other institu tions to  incorporate these materials into new or existing courses.  In addition to conventional dissemination channels, selected  portions of the teaching materials will be made available on  the internet, along with student research reports, software,  and teacher advice.  Students and their teachers can share  ideas and participate in a mutually supportive nationwide  community.",
