Some undergraduate students will assist with development of the project and all students will benefit from the integration of both established and cutting-edge research into a traditional curriculum.    Over a three year period, undergraduates, graduate students and faculty from the Department of Computer Science will develop these materials primarily in the summers and integrate them into the courses during the academic year.  In the second year, faculty and undergraduates from Western Carolina University, Appalachian State University, University of North Carolina Ashville, North Carolina Central University and East Carolina University will join in the development of materials and the integration of materials into courses at their institutions.  All materials are being made available  on the World Wide Web.",
