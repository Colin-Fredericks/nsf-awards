The research project focuses on the consequences of the  stress-driven morphological instability which occurs during film  growth.  In particular, the formation of the \"island\" morphology will  be explained in terms of mathematical models for the morphological  instability.  The research program consists of two projects, one  focusing on single-component films, the second focusing on alloy  films.  In the first project, a \"state of the art\" model for the  formation of three-dimensional islands will be developed.  This model  will include a crucial treatment of the wetting layer between the film  and its underlying substrate.  In the second project, a basic model  will be developed for the more complicated problem of morphology  development in alloy films, where composition variations and stress  variations are coupled.  In both projects the mathematical models are  nonlinear free boundary problems for the shape of the film.  These  problems will be analyzed using applied mathematical techniques which  include analytical, asymptotic, and numerical methods.  In particular,  an asymptotic description for the island shape will be derived which  takes advantage of the fact that islands generally have a much smaller  height than width.  The results of the work will be compared to  observations of islands in strained film systems from both  collaborative research projects and published experimental results.  The models will be evaluated to determine the extent to which they can  be used to predict and control morphologies, as well as to determine  future directions for improving mathematical models of strained film  growth as part of a long-term research program.    %%%    The objective of this research is to develop mathematical models to  predict and control mo rphology development in strained solid films.  Strained solid films are of great technological importance in  semiconductor device applications.  The strained films are grown from  a vapor through the deposition of the solid film onto an underlying  substrate of a different material.  Because of the bonding of the film  to the substrate, the film is grown in a state of stress.  During the  growth of these films, the stresses in the film can lead to the  formation of bumps, or \"islands.\"  The presence of these islands has a  crucial effect on the electronic properties of the thin film device,  so a knowledge of what controls island formation enables a better  control over the electronic properties of the strained film device.  The objective of this research is to describe island formation from  physically-derived mathematical models of the film growth process.  This mathematical model represents a complementary alternative to  traditional experiment-based research on strained films.  The primary  benefit of developing such a model is that it allows one to quickly  and easily determine how the growth of the film is affected by the  different material parameters and process parameters.  Thus, the model  has three main applications in the development and production of  strained solid films.  Firstly, by changing the parameters in the  model, the model can be used as a low-cost way to \"experiment\" with  different materials and growth configurations.  Secondly, the  mathematical model can be used to help engineer materials by  determining the necessary process inputs required to achieve a  strained solid film with specified physical and electronic properties.  Finally, the mathematical model can assist in the determination of  optimum and/or acceptable processing conditions for the manufacture of  strained films in industry.    ***",
