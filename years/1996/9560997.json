 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores a novel hybrid steam-plasma (HSP) torch that has broad application for advanced materials synthesis, chemical conversion, waste redemption, coating deposition, and gasification.  The research objectives aim at a prototype HSP torch and focus on demonstrating its application in plasma spray operations.  The demonstration focuses on reliability and ease of use in an industrial environment.       The Phase I research will address issues like requirements for a durable electrode material for the steam-plasma environment.  Plasma spraying is expected to have a large market potential.  Phase II is planned to include detailed evaluations on the metallurgical nature of the sprayed metal and of its bonding characteristics with substrates.       Use of the HSP torch is expected to improve process productivity and open new applications for plasma spray technology.  As a generic processing tool, it may open a broad range of chemical processing applications.  These include nano-powered synthesis, conversion of methane to acetylene, and gasification of black liquor in the pulp industry.  A significant market for this technology may be found in the treatment of hazardous chemical and biological agents, including CFC's, PCB's, and other toxic or carcinogenic substances.",
