 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-60712  Yadav     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on developing significantly better varistors by the engineering of interfaces. The need for better varistors originates from the fact that almost all electronic devices are subject to noise and high voltage surges from IC integration, switching or electrostatic discharge. These surges and noises can severely affect the performance of electrical and electronic devices. Varistors based on metal oxides are commonly used to minimize this problem. However, current metal oxide varistor device technology is not well suited for rapid response, low voltages and high frequency applications. This program seeks to direct efforts to remedy this. The proposed technical approach is to synthesize and fabricate varistors from materials with very large interfacial area. The resultant varistors are expected to be dramatically smaller, lighter, and yet feature higher non-linear coefficient, lower leakage current, and higher critical electric field values. These advantages are expected from increased interfacial area, homogeneity, increased density, and potential quantum confinement effects. During Phase I, the proof-of-concept will be established. Phase II will develop, optimize and field test the varistors, and commercialization of the devices will occur during Phase III.   Proposed varistor technology can enable system miniaturization without sacrificing electronic component performance. Applications include varistors for protecting integrated LSIs, ICs, telecommunications equipment, electric power and transmission management, and for devices to dramatically improve reliability of energy and automotive electronics.",
