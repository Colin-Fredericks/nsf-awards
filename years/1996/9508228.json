 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry Program, will support studies by Professor Gordon Anderson of   the University of Missouri, St. Louis, on two types of bimetallic   complexes of platinum and/or palladium.  The first type are homonuclear   diplatinum alkyl complexes that are bridged by   (diarylphosphino)cyclopentadienyl ligands.  These complexes will be used   as a platform for the investigation of mechanisms of carbonylation and   alkane elimination reactions within the dinuclear unit.  The second type   of dinuclear complexes to be investigated are hydride bridged homo- and   heteronuclear palladium and platinum complexes whose dinuclear structures   are based upon bridging bis(diphenylphosphino)methane and related   ligands.  Alkyl derivatives of the heteronuclear complexes will be used   to study competitive reductive elimination (of alkane), and competitive   electrophilic M-C bond cleavage reaction.  The homonuclear dipalladium   complexes provide a unique opportunity to study the chemical properties   of palladium hydride complexes, which are normally highly unstable.  NMR   spectroscopy will be used extensively for investigating these reactions.  Catalysis is necessary to increase the rates and often the selectivity of   many industrial processes. The rational design of new, or even improved,   catalytic systems requires detailed knowledge of the individual steps   that participate in the catalytic cycle.  This work is aimed at   developing the fundamental understanding of some reactions of complexes   of metals that are frequently involved in catalysis.  The results of   these studies may ultimately be used to develop new catalytic processes   of industrial importance.",
