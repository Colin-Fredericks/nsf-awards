 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632456 Osgood  This research project aims for greater fundamental understanding of non-equilibrium chemistries at semiconductor surfaces appropriate for advanced approaches to epitaxial growth of II-VI thin films, including new surface cleaning/preparation techniques, and routes to sequential reactions which are applicable to the technique of atomic layer epitaxy.  The overall objective is to understand fundamental microscopic mechanisms in two classes of model molecular systems for light-assisted epitaxies(MOCVD, MOMBE, and ALE); metal alkyls(di-methyl zinc and di-ethyl cadmium) and Group VI halides(H2S and H2Se) on CdTe and ZnSe surfaces will be studied.  Auger and photoelectron spectroscopies along with thermal desorption and time of flight mass spectroscopy will be used to assess reaction products and binding sites, ejected fragment translational energy, and reaction cross sections. %%% The project is multidisciplinary combining fundamental materials chemistry and materials science synthesis and processing studies with advanced characterization tools and analysis methods to address forefront issues in a topical area of technological relevance and high potential payoff.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to several aspects of advanced electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry.  The knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
