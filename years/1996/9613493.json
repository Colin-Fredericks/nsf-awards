 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropical deforestation is a substantial problem of worldwide concern.  National parks have been established by many nations to conserve forests, but their effectiveness in protecting forests is in doubt due to their limited size.  As a result, forests in adjoining agricultural landscapes are increasingly recognized as important components of protected area ecosystems.  This research focuses on human forest conservation behaviors that contribute to patterns of forest cover that enhance the conservation benefits of parks and protected areas.   The norms and values that may motivate forest conservation behavior in economically less developed countries are changing in important ways.  Surprising findings from recent research indicate that people in poorer countries value the environment as much as their counterparts in wealthier parts of the world.  But does the growing importance of environmental values lead to improved forest conservation behavior?  Exposure to an expanding array of sometimes conflicting values can lead to social fragmentation, value conflicts between individuals and uncertainty about socially appropriate environmental behaviors.   This project will evaluate the role of values in environmental behavior contrasting experiences in Costa Rica and Honduras.  The objectives are:  1) to determine the sources of environmental norms and values in economically less-developed settings, focusing on hypotheses posed in recent literature; 2) to specify relationships between environmental norms and values and forest conservation behaviors in protected area buffer zones; 3) to evaluate outcomes of self-reported forest conservation behaviors with objective measures of forest management and change; 4) to develop policy recommendation on protected area buffer zone management based on research findings.",
