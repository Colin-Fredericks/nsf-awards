 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514885  Tabakin       The new continuous electron beam facility (CEBAF)  generates an electron beam that is not only energetic (4  GeV), but provides a large, steady current.  With that beam,  plus state-of-the art detectors, experimentalists will  perform precision, innovative experiments to determine what  happens when high-energy electromagnetic radiation (provided  by the electrons) strikes a proton.  Protons and electrons,  which are prime building blocks of matter, have spin.  At  CEBAF, it will be possible to orient and measure their  spins.  Our goal will be to predict, using quark-models of  the proton structure, the angular distribution of the mesons  that are produced in such experiments.  Mesons are the  particles that generate the strong interactions that  provide the nuclear or strong force, also called hadron  dynamics.  Some mesons are spinless, some have a spin of  one, in some cases spin 2.  We will predict, not only the  likelihood of the production at various angels (their cross-  sections), but also how their production is influenced by  the initial electron and proton spin orientations and what  final proton and meson spin orientations are predicted by  the best available electromagnetic and strong interaction  theories.  Thus, we will be testing the validity of present  formulations of hadron dynamics.  ***",
