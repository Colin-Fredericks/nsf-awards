 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622690  Victory    The primary goal of this research is the numerical analysis of Vlasov kinetic   equations which describe collisionless and collisional plasma models.    Research efforts will focus on particle methods used in conjunction with   finite element or finite-difference methods for determining the fields, and   with implicit time-integrating schemes for advancing particles.  Because   there are seven independent variables in realistic (three-dimensional)   problems, it is not practical to base numerical simulations on classical   finite-differences, finite elements, or spectral methods.  Practical   simulations are based on particle methods, whose implementation requires a   solid understanding of the existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties   of Vlasov kinetic models.  In particular, it is proposed to carry out   investigations in the following two directions: (A). Numerical analysis of   the Vlasov kinetic equations modeling collisionless plasmas.  In particular,   implicit time-integrating methods for advancing particles are incorporated   into the numerical analysis of particle-in-cell schemes for Vlasov-Poisson   systems.  Also the convergence theory of particle approximations for   Vlasov-Poisson systems is extended to treat Vlasov-Maxwell and Vlasov-  Einstein problems.  (B). Numerical analysis of Vlasov kinetic equations   modeling plasmas with collisions.  In particular, nonlinear collision   operators of Landau (Fokker-Planck) type and of Boltzmann type arising in   semiconductor physics are added to the underlying Vlasov-Poisson or   Vlasov-Maxwell system.  The analyses involve stochastic and deterministic   particle methods involving operator splitting into nonlinear convective and   collisional portions.    Much of the interest in kinetic equations is derived from the practical and   economic benefits that  would accrue from applying knowledge of such   equations to problems arising in laser fusion,  plasma physics, and   semiconductors.  Vlasov kinetic equation s mathematically model such   phenomena as diverse as laser-matter interactions occurring in controlled   and laser fusion, and the transport of electrons in quantum environments   present in semiconductors. The research efforts being  supported by the   National Science Foundation have as objective the rigorous investigation of   numerical approximations to Vlasov kinetic models, with the goal of   enabling scientists to perform computations efficiently in determining   energies, moments, etc.  The work undertaken here would affect the current   base of plasma and  semiconductor technology in providing extended   qualitative analysis and robust numerical procedures for the study of   transport of electrons in semiconductors, laser-matter interactions, and the   onset of instabilities in an electron plasma.  In addition, the numerical   analysis of nonlinear mathematical models has had a traditionally wide   audience among applied academic and industrial mathematicians.  This fact   will have a significant impact on the academic or industrial career prospects   of students who decide to pursue advanced degrees in the study of nonlinear   equations of kinetic type.",
