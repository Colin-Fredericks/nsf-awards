 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop a user friendly  nonlinear optical microscope to be housed in the Center for  Biomedical Imaging Technology (CBIT) at the University of  Connecticut Health Center. This will be a cooperative project  between Health Center faculty, the CBIT staff, and the University  of Connecticut Photonics Research Center. The CBIT and Photonics  Research Center staff will work together to couple new laser  technologies to a scanning confocal microscope. The Health Center  faculty who currently use laser scanning confocal fluorescence  microscopy will be able to explore innovative biological  applications with this emerging technology. An integral component  of our approach is the synthesis of new nonlinear optical dyes by  the CBIT staff for specific labeling of biological molecules.       Although confocal microscopy has proven to be a powerful  technique, nonlinear or two-photon excitation of fluorophores  avoids many of the inherent disadvantages of traditional  fluorescence confocal microscopy. In particular, out of plane  photobleaching, photodamage and background fluorescence are  greatly reduced in nonlinear excitation. In addition, this method  has greater sensitivity and affords better depth discrimination  and light penetration into thick samples. These properties make  nonlinear microscopy an excellent method for the study of living  cells.       There are currently seventeen academic laboratories at the  Health Center who utilize confocal microscopy and this improved  methodology is expected to be used by many of these groups. The  research of Carson, Cowan, Jaffe and Terasaki, Koppel, and Loew  are highlighted in this proposal; the nonlinear microscope will  improve the quality and capabilities of their current experiments  on a variety of living cells.       Loew and CBIT will design and synthesize new dyes to be used  in two photon fluorescence and second harmonic generation to  measure membrane potential. The photophysics of these dyes will  be charac terized with the new laser systems. In addition, some of  the local pharmaceutical companies are active confocal users and  are expected to takes advantage of the new instrument.        The CBIT Bio-Rad MRC600 confocal microscope is being  dedicated to the development of this instrument. The project will  begin by modifying this microscope for nonlinear absorption and  detection. High peak power pulsed lasers are required for  nonlinear absorption and both commercial and custom laser systems  will be utilized in this project. A commercial Titanium Sapphire  femtosecond laser system will provide wavelength coverage from  720-900 nm for absorption from 360-450 nm. Concurrently the  Photonics Research Center will develop user-friendly fiber-optic  based modelocked lasers which will operate at 1064 nm and 1500  nm. These lasers will be integrated into the nonlinear microscope  as the technology become available.        The first generation of fiber lasers will initially be  actively modelocked since this technology is expected to be  straightforward to implement. The next generation will be  passively modelocked and is expected to be very robust. Initially  these lasers will provide pulse widths of less than 100  picoseconds and the developmental process will include efforts to  further reduce these widths. In the long term, these lasers are  expected to be more cost effective than Titanium Sapphire systems  and easier for the casual user to operate. To provide a wide  range of wavelengths, and thus usable fluorescent labeling dyes,  the Titanium Sapphire and fiber lasers can be used together for  sum-frequency excitation allowing coverage of a broad range of  fluorescent probes absorbing from 350 - 750 nm.        It is hope that this combination of fiber optic lasers and  nonlinear microscopy will become a standard experimental method,  much like laser scanning confocal microscopy has emerged as such  in the last decade. Indeed, the advantages of 2-photon and other  non-linear microscopies are so s ignificant that the development  of reasonable lasers might very well breach the only barrier to  having this new technology completely replace confocal  microscopy.",
