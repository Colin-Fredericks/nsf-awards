 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center     The Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center(MATEC) will be operated by the Maricopa County Community College District (90,000 students), the nation's second largest community college system, in partnership with ten semiconductor manufacturing/supporting industries, including giants like Intel, Motorola, SGS-Thompson, and Microchip Technology; two Tech Prep consortiums with 13 secondary school districts (60,000 students); Arizona State University, the nation's largest public university (43,000 students); three other Community College Districts (Arizona/Oregon); and Albuquerque Technical-Vocational Institute. Primary objectives are 1) to create new curricular systems/materials which reduce the gap between what is taught and learned in schools and what is needed by technicians in semiconductor manufacturing/related supporting industries; 2) to provide technical support, instructional support, and access to resources that faculty/trainers who are preparing students for careers as technicians need to ensure continuing relevance to workplace needs; 3)to increase the number of students, especially women and minorities, who prepare for and become employed as technicians in the semiconductor manufacturing/supportive industries. Targeted programs are Semiconductor Manufacturing/Processing Technology, Circuit Design Technology, and Facilities Maintenance Technology. MATEC's three components are: Curriculum/Materials Development, Staff Development/Support, and Workforce Development Support. Examples of strategies are Computer-Based Instructional Design System, Continuous Quality Curriculum System, Multimedia \"Virtual\" Materials, Electronic Resource Center/Form, On-line Q/A, Faculty Internships, Scholarships, and Workshops/Seminars for a national audience. Outcome evaluation uses gap reduction model with measurement instrument to be developed by American College Testing based on specific job profiles of skill levels necessary in workplace.",
