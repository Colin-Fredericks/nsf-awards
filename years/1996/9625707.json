This interdisciplinary workshop on human/computer interaction and persons with disabilities will provide a national forum for the exploration of the research issues and the development of a national plan for the inclusion of the needs of persons with disabilities within the more general human/computer interaction research framework.  There has been increased awareness of the need for including persons with disabilities in the benefits to society of computing and communications technology.  This has been supported by the development of new technologies that provide increased accessibility for persons with physical, sensory and learning disabilities.  The workshop will convene within the first three months of 1996 and will involve forty university and industry researchers in human/computer interaction and assistive technology, along with representatives of Federal agencies in a three-day program.  The outcome will be a report to the National Science Foundation.  An edited, draft report will also be presented at the ACM ASSETS Conference held in conjunction with the ACM SIGCHI Conference in April 1996.",
