The sol-gel  process is combined with methods for making colloidal particles  by homogeneous precipitation from electrolyte solutions. The  feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated by successful  preparation of a material consisting of large numbers of 0.1-1  micrometer chromium hydroxide spheres embedded within a silica  xerogel. Homogeneous precipitation offers the possibility of  making a wide variety of particles and the means for exercising  systematic control over particle morphology. The goals of the  proposed research are to determine whether this technique can be  extended to generate particles with different compositions within  gels; whether it is possible to create crystalline particles; and  whether the metal salt particles can be reduced to metal. Other  experiments will investigate the role of the gel matrix in  controlling particle size.   %%%  Synthesis of composite materials consisting of colloidal  particles dispersed within an inorganic or organic matrix is of  considerable interest because of applications in catalysis and  optics, among other areas. A new strategy for making such  composites has been devised that combines the sol-gel process  with methods for making colloidal particles by homogeneous  precipitation from electrolyte solutions. The feasibility of this  approach has been demonstrated by successful preparation of a  material consisting of large numbers of 0.1-1 micrometer chromium  hydroxide spheres embedded within a silica xerogel.
