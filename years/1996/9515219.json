 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last two decades, a constant or growing level of direct  foreign investment relative to trade has been observed.  This  fact is at odds with the most simple minded theory of direct  investment which is based on the notion that firms invest to  avoid trade barriers.  Direct investment has been rising faster  than trade during an era in which trade barriers have decreased  steadily and dramatically.  Furthermore, the developed countries  are not only the major sources of direct investment, they are  also the major recipients.  Thus, direct investment is not  primarily a transfer of technology and skills from developed to  less developed countries.  Also, a country's multinationals are  often concentrated in a few industries, and those industry  specializations are not obviously explained by current  conditions.  While it is understood why some industries are more  multinationalized than others, there is little understanding of  how country characteristics determine and are determined by  multinational activity.  The focus of this research is on  explaining the causes behind the rapid growth of multinational  activity in an environment where trade has concurrently been  liberalized, and the causes for differences among countries in  the structure of outgoing investments.  This research is  important because it will shed light on a number of important  trade issues such as when multinationals transfer technology, do  they augment or replace learning that would have occurred in the  recipient country.",
