The first part is intended to derive asymptotic properties of  singularly perturbed nonstationary Markov chains and perturbed chains with weak and  strong interactions, and to obtain asymptotic optimality in related control problems.   The second part comprises the development of asymptotic properties of global  stochastic optimization algorithms.  By using weak convergence methods, convergence  and rates of convergence are to be established, and the convergence of suitably scaled  sequences to the solutions of appropriate stochastic differential equations is to be  ascertained.  In the third part, by combining stochastic approximation methods with  kernel estimators, passive stochastic approximation algorithms are to be obtained.   Here the goal is to establish convergence of the algorithms and to obtain error  estimates.  The fourth part encompasses numerical procedures for solving a class of  robust control problems of piecewise deterministic Markov chains, and the  development of stochastic gradient descent algorithms for approximating the optimal  threshold values under the WIP (work in progress) policies for multi-machine  manufacturing systems.  Convergence and asymptotic properties of the algorithms are  to be obtained.  The entire research project will include two components: analysis and  simulation. The main objectives are to enhance basic understanding of the asymptotic  properties of the underlying systems and to develop sound and feasible algorithms.        This proposal consists of four closely related topics. It is a bridge-building  attempt to link theory and application in stochastic optimization.  Emphasis is on the   development of efficient numerical methods via analysis and numerical  experimentation. The first topic deals with systems that are subject to rapid and  random variations. The results obtained are intended be useful for applications  involving hierarchical decision making, production planning, queuing networks in  communication, and system reliability. To meet the increasing demand for efficient   numerical procedures for global optimization, the second part of the project focuses  on the development of numerical algorithms when random errors in the data have to  be taken into account.  The results are applicable to an ever expanding range of  applications in estimation, identification and optimization problems.  The research  undertaken in the third part of this program derives from steady state estimation and  detection problems in chemical engineering (for a continuously stirred tank and for a  binary distillation column).  The emphasis is on the design and implementation of  numerical algorithms, which are expected to also have a variety of applications in  target recognition, tracking, system failure detection, signal processing and related  fields. The fourth part of the program is concerned with optimization methods for  unreliable manufacturing systems.  By emphasizing system stability rather than  optimality alone, numerical methods for a class of robust control problems of  production planning are to be developed.  Under nowadays popular Kanban policies,  which were originally promoted by the Japanese auto industry, a numerical procedure  that will provide a systematic way of finding the optimal number of Kanbans for  manufacturing systems is to be developed..  ***",
