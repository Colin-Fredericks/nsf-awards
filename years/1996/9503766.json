 "awd_abstract_narration": "9503766  Spanos  This project conducts a research investigation featuring improved  models which accurately describe the seismic response of equipment  and of some other block-like structural systems.  The approach  undertaken in this study considers the impact of the block with the  foundation as a continuous process of time.  This impact model  represents the influence of most of the important geometrical,  mechanical, and material quantities such as material stiffness,  block aspect ratio, value of the coefficient of friction, and the  plastic behavior of the structure.  Further, new numerical methods  for analysis and design of multi-block systems based on versatile  discrete element method will be developed.  Stochastic analysis of  block-like structures under earthquake excitations will also be  carried out.  Upon developing the theoretical and numerical aspects  of the proposed methods, these models and the analyses will be  applied to investigate the design problems of a variety of  practical equipment and historical monuments structures.  ***",
