 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631786  Tahernezhadi  This proposal involves hardware and software design projects for  undergraduate electrical engineering students with the aim of  helping persons with disabilities.  The projects will benefit  individuals with communicative impairment, including speech  disorders, phonetic disorders, and inability to communicate due  to motor disabilities.  Among the devices to be developed are a  software system allowing a child to practice pronunciation of  word lists with minimum adult supervision; a voice communicator  to be used in emergency situations without the need of American  Sign Language or a TTY device; and wireless communication devices  permitting a child to summon help when the caretaker is  unavailable.  Through their work, the students will gain valuable  engineering problem-solving skills, learn to appreciate their  educational experience which enabled them to assist persons with  disabilities, be encouraged to continue their education in the  field, and be better prepared for the competitive job market.  Before the actual hardware implementation, computer simulations  will be carried out by students to validate their designs.  These  computer programs will be used to demonstrate the projects to  potential engineering students and high school graduates at  events such as National Engineers' Week and college open houses.  Such demonstrations will attract new students into engineering  and will allow the public to have a better understanding of how  engineering schools are serving the local community.  ***",
