 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Skidmore College for a summer program for undergraduates to provide them with research experiences in cognitive and developmental psychology.   Ten students will be selected for the six-week program.  Projects serving as the focus of the summer experience will include the study of children's memory confusions, individual differences in imagery ability and their relationship to memory, factors mediating face recognition under conditions of incomplete visual information, and the effects on fact recognition of identical experiences.  Activities will include an orientation workshop, courses on research methods and data analysis, and student presentations of the results of their work.  The goal will be to promote ways for students to secure more sustained laboratory experiences culminating in independent research projects.  This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.",
