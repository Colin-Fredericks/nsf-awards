 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511252  Eichengreen    Recent turbulence in foreign exchange markets, especially within  the European Monetary System (ERM), has raised new questions  about the causes of speculative attacks on pegged exchange rates.   It is surprising in this light that we do not possess a body of  evidence that establishes stylized facts about the behavior of  macroeconomic variables around the time of attacks.  The goal of  this project is to develop stylized empirical facts about the  behavior of critical economic and political variables around the  time of speculative attacks on pegged currencies.  It will do so  by developing a data set suitable for studying the causes and  consequences of speculative crises and subjecting it to  univariate and multivariate statistical analysis.  The project  plans to address questions such as the following:  Are there  differences in the behavior of key macroeconomic  variable sin  periods prior to speculative attacks on pegged exchange rates  compared to other periods?  Are there \"early warning signals\" of  pending currency crises?  Does the behavior of these key  variables change in the aftermath of speculative attacks?  Are  political outcomes affected by speculative attacks?  Do answers  to these questions different in the different times and places in  which exchange rates are pegged?  Do they differ for ERM and non-  ERM currencies, in particular?  Or are speculative attacks all  alike?",
