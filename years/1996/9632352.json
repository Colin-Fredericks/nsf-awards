 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632352  Yeh  This action is to support U.S. participation in the International  Workshop on Tsunami Mitigation and Risk Assessment, to be held in  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Kamchatka, Russia, August 1996.  This  workshop is organized by the Institute of Computational  Technologies, Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russia.    The workshop theme is \"the state-of-the-art of the problem of  long-term tsunami prognosis (estimation of tsunami risk)\", and  the following topics will be discussed:  (1) paleo-tsunami research,  (2) historical catalogs and data bases,  (3) seismo-tectonics of tsunami,  (4) numerical models of tsunami behavior,  (5) methods of tsunami-risk calculations, and  (6) mitigation and counter-measures  The format of the workshop will be round-table discussions with  40-minute invited presentations on each particular topic.    This workshop is a follow-on to three major workshops on tsunamis  held in the United States during 1995: Tsunami Deposit Workshop,  Seattle, Washington, 21-23 May, and the two NSF-supported  workshops, Tsunami Measurement Workshop, Estes Park, Colorado, 28-  30 June, and Second International Workshop on Long-Wave Runup  Models, Friday Harbor, Washington, 12-16 September.    In order to use the limited funds as effectively as possible, the  PI will establish close communication, via the Internet e-mail  system, with the US tsunami scientists and engineers who are  unable to attend the workshop.  Tsunami researchers and  practitioners are already in close communication via the Tsunami  Internet mailing list sponsored by the NOAA (National Atmospheric  and Oceanic Administration) Pacific Marine and Environmental  Laboratory (PMEL) in Seattle.    Active participation of US scientists and engineers in this  workshop in Kamchatka will contribute significantly to the  continued efforts toward tsunami disaster mitigation, and assure  the continued activity and momentum in this important area of  disaster mitigation.  ***",
