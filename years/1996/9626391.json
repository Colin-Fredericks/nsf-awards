 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626391  Lakin       The investigator combines biomathematical modeling,  computation, scaling, asymptotics and perturbation techniques to  obtain a more complete understanding of basic physical mechanisms  associated with dynamic processes in the human intracranial  system.  A consistent, fully time-dependent, nonlinear lumped  parameter model describing interactions between pressures,  volumes, and flows in intracranial space is refined, validated,  and expanded to include additional physiology, such as  cerebrovascular autoregulation and links to the spinal  cerebrospinal fluid space.  First order processes and relevant  time scales are identified using scaling and asymptotic  techniques.  To achieve the higher resolution necessary to  consider focal events, dynamic modeling within compartments and  consistent linkage of sub-models with the rest of the lumped  parameter system is explored.  Computational methods and  strategies for efficient numerical solution of the nonlinear  model equations are developed.  In particular, results obtained  using hybrid asymptotic-numerical methods show great promise in  the present context where processes occur on disparate time  scales.       This project seeks to develop a realistic yet tractable  mathematical model for pressures and fluid flows in the human  brain.  Toward this end, the current model formulation is extended  to include additional human physiology, such as cerebrovascular  autoregulation, the mechanism which maintains the blood flow in  the brain necessary for adequate oxygen transfer in the face of  fluctuating blood pressure.  New hybrid solution techniques are  developed to carry out efficient and accurate computer  simulations of pressures and flows based on the model equations.  The enhanced model is also validated by comparing its  mathematical predictions with physiological data.  Situations  involving both normal and pathophysiology are studied.  This  research is part of an interdisciplinary effort involving both  applied mathema ticians and neurosurgeons.  Although the developing  mathematical model appears to have significant clinical utility  in situations involving pathology, clinical aspects are not  considered in the present research.  The focus is entirely on  increasing our basic understanding of pressures and flows in the  brain.  Once developed and validated, the enhanced mathematical  model will be useful to researchers studying applications  associated with biotechnology.  For example, regulation of the  vascular system in the brain plays a crucial role in conditions  such as trauma and stroke.  Currently, nitric oxide is emerging as  a key factor in adjusting brain blood flow.  The enhanced  mathematical model, which includes a vascular regulation  equation, can be used to study the effect of nitric oxide  synthase (NOS) inhibitors on the brain.  The development of NOS  inhibitors is a subject of great current interest to U.S.  biotechnology companies.",
