 "awd_abstract_narration": "A quantitative X-ray microanalysis system with image enhancement and processing capabilities will be acquired to add analytical and chemical mapping capabilities to an existing scanning electron microscope. Our goal is to expose students to modern techniques in the analysis of geological and biological specimens, improve our instructional capabilities, and strengthen our program of undergraduate research.  The specific instrumentation we request is an EDAX MX10 X-ray system. The system consists of an energy dispersive spectrometer interfaced to a Macintosh Power PC microprocessor with digital imaging software. This system will be attached to the Biology Department's existing AMRAY scanning electron microscope.     The addition of this equipment to the science curriculum at Hamilton College will allow: i) us to expand the current one-half semester course to a full semester course with the addition of X-ray microanalysis to the curriculum; ii) for considerable improvement in laboratory and in-class exercises in both introductory and upper level courses; and iii) modernization and improvement of student thesis research and independent study projects.     The significance of this equipment addition will be to enhance student interest in scientific research, and to provide students with hands-on experience using state-of-the-art equipment and techniques used in both graduate level research and industry. Students will be encouraged to present the results of independent research projects at professional conferences. In addition, the co-PIs will make the instructional materials developed from this grant available to the educational/scientific community through the Hamilton College Electron Microscope lab's WWW-site.",
