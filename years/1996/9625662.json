 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625662  Keyhani    In the next few decades, the power systems of the United States  will face bottlenecks in transferring bulk power due to the  virtual absence of new transmission line construction.  The  increased utilization of existing facilities to cope with the  growing magnitude of bulk power transfers and third-party access  will require a closer look at system stability requirements.  In  addition, as more thyristor-based controllers, including phase  shifters, advanced static VAR compensators, and modulator series  capacitors, are used to control bulk power networks, accurate  dynamic models of generators, will be required for precise  control of bulk power transmission systems.    Rapid development in computer technology has facilitated  computerized instrumentation of power systems.  In the next few   years, power systems will be monitored and operated by many  computers in a decentralized control structure.  Computers will  be installed in power plants to monitor the input and output  responses of the generators.  The operating responses can be used  for the development of generator models and tracking of key  parameters for incipient failure detection.    The objectives of this project are to develop a new technology  for identification of round rotor generator models based on  operating data resulting from disturbances occurring in power  systems.  The operating data for this project will be provided by  Arizona Public Service Company (APS) for Cholla and Four Corners  units (see Section H for APS letter of support).  Signal  processing and system identification methods will be used to  develop the technology for estimation of stability parameter of  the round rotor generators from the operating data.    The significance of the proposed research is that engineers at  utility companies can use the proposed technology to develop  generator models for use in power system control and stability  studies.  Furthermore, by tracking the machine parameters and  turns ratio of stator and f ield windings, the incipient faults   of synchronous machines can be detected in real time.  Finally,  the results of this research can be used by the power systems  control engineers to accurately predict and control the dynamic  performance of electronically-controlled future power systems.  ***",
