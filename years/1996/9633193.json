 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633193  Strathmann    Animals in numerous phyla release eggs into the plankton  where they develop without parental protection. Their  development to first swimming is briefer than in related  species with more protected embryos. Selection appears to  favor their short time to swimming, but the time varies. In  this research, four questions will be answered by  comparisons within and between groups of marine animals. (1)  Is duration of embryonic development to first swimming  correlated with the number of cells in locomotory  structures? (2) Is this duration influenced more strongly by  functional differences that occur within phyla, such as  presence/absence of a feeding larval stage or egg size? (3)  Do more protected embryos develop more slowly (in addition  to developing for a longer time) before first swimming? (4)  Is duration of development to first feeding correlated with  numbers of cells in structures used for ciliary feeding?  This study may demonstrate extraordinarily persistent limits  on convergence in embryonic durations and functional reasons  for those limits. Alternatively, this study could show that  diverse forms of animals have converged on similar embryonic  durations in diverse ways. Either outcome will indicate  clade-specific constraints on how marine animals pass  through the one-cell bottleneck in their life history.",
