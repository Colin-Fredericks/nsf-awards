 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research consists of three projects.  The first concerns the  impact of demographic changes on the demand for various types of  government spending with age-specific benefits.  While the  consequences of an aging U.S. population for the Social Security  and Medicare trust funds has received substantial attention, the  consequences for other categories of government spending, in  particular spending on primary and secondary education, are  relatively unstudied.  This project uses data on the composition  of government spending in states, as well as in individual school  districts, to study the effect of the population's demographic  composition on the level of public spending.  The results will  provide insights on alternative explanations for declining  popular support for public education.    A second project focuses on the effect of tax subsidies and  tax-related regulations on employer-provided health insurance and  other employee benefits.  One aspect of this analysis is a study  of how individuals who are eligible for Flexible Spending  Accounts (FSAs) use these accounts.  These accounts are closely  related to \"Medical IRAs,\" which have recently attracted  substantial popular attention.  The extent to which employees use  FSAs, and whether they make reasonable estimates of their annual  medical expenses in funding these accounts, should provide  important information to decision-makers about Medical IRAs.    The final project considers the impact of taxation on individual  portfolio decisions.  Using the rich variation in tax rates  provided by the 1986 Tax Reform Act, and data from the 1983,  1992, and 1995 Surveys of Consumer Finances, the research  examines what effect, if any, changing tax rules have had on the  types of assets held by households in different tax situations.  The resulting estimates will provide a basis for assessing the  inefficiencies associated with tax-induced distortions in  portfolio choice.",
