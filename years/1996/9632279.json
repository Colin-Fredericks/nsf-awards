 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632279 Wu  This research project addresses film growth mechanisms in fast temperature ramping Hg-vapor annealing(FTRA) of Hg-based cuprate(HgBaCaCuO) superconductor films.  The film growth mechanism in the FTRA process will be studied by correlating processing parameters to the sample physical properties including phase purity, film/substrate interface structure and surface morphology, Tc, Jc, and other superconducting characteristics.  Expectations are that the FTRA technique can minimize problems caused by the high volatility of the Hg-compounds involved, formation of CaHgO2, and chemical reactions at the film/substrate interface.  Chemical-doping-assisted growth of Hg-based cuprate films using Na, Tl, or Re as the dopant will also be investigated to achieve high-purity epitaxial Hg-1223 thin films. Rare-earth garnets and LaAlO3 will be used as substrates in the fabrication of large-area Hg-based cuprate wafers. %%% The project is multidisciplinary combining fundamental materials chemistry/physics and materials processing studies with advanced characterization tools and analysis methods to address forefront issues in a topical area of high scientific value and potential technological benefits.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to several aspects of advanced microwave and microelectronic devices.  The knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials processing routes.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
