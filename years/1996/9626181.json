 "awd_abstract_narration": "The statistical modeling of multistage sequential manufacturing  processes requires models both for processes running as desired  and for processes suffering from faults.  In addition, tools are  needed for monitoring and controlling the process, for diagnosing  faults, and for predicting future data.  This research project is  developing such models and tools.  A starting point is a  hierarchical mixture of recursive regression models with Markov  transition structure having the faulty processes as absorbing  states. Developing the models requires understanding the  sensitivity of predictions to the parameters of the models.  For  example, the use of absorbing states for faulty processes,  although intuitively appealing and mathematically simple, does  lead to some undesirable results that need to be addressed.   Prediction requires numerical methods for adequately summarizing  uncertainty from many sources.  In particular, it is often  necessary to predict yield several stages in the future  for an ongoing process, and the marginal distributions for the  output are not available in closed form.  Monitoring ongoing processes requires the development of  appropriate summary statistics and displays.  Diagnosis and  monitoring both require the ability to partition uncertainty  amongst several competing possibilities (such as different  possible faults) and make decisions based on the relative costs  of the possible errors.    %%%  The research develops a general framework for modeling multistage  sequential manufacturing processes.  The framework facilitates  monitoring of ongoing processes, prediction of future and current  yield, and diagnosis of faults.  In a multistage process with  in-line measurements, information becomes available sequentially  and one needs to update one's state of knowledge as the  information arrives.  This leads naturally to the use of a  Bayesian statistical approach to the modeling of uncertainties in  such a process.  The process level problems addressed by this   research are those of in-line measurement choice, control chart  construction, learning about immature processes, and process  control.  The research will lead to more sensitive monitoring  tools and more comprehensive prediction and diagnosis tools that  should help to improve the competitiveness of American  manufacturers in high technology areas such as very large scale  integrated circuit production.   ***",
