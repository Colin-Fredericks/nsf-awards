 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510270  Clark  The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design Projects  Program category, and requests support for undergraduate and  graduate student engineers to provide prototype \"custom designed\"  devices and software to aid persons with disabilities.  The  primary goal of this thrust is to provide meaningful design  experience for the engineering student that will directly aid a  specific disabled individual. A formal program is in place at the  University of Massachusetts-Lowell which will ensure satisfactory  progress is attained on these projects.  A group of students and  the investigators on the grant will work with a number of  collaborating agencies and individuals on these projects.  Fifty  projects are planned during the five year duration of this award,  and a written report on the completed projects will be submitted  for an annual publication.    Once completed, each project will be given to the person for whom  it is designed.  The hope is that this \"real world\" experience  will give engineering students a sense of purpose and pride, help  engineering schools serve the community, attract new students  into engineering, and raise student interest in graduate  education.    This type of undertaking is important since it provides a  meaningful experience for engineering students as part of their  undergraduate design requirements, and will also benefit a  population where customization is often needed for rehabilitation  devices.  ***",
