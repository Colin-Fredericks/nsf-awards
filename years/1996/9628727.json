 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wang, Jinkang  U. of Southern California   The presence or absence of beach cusps in a coastal environment may be considered as one diagnostic of the nearshore morphodynamic regime.  This project will explore mechanisms of beach cusp formation on gravel beaches through the empirical evaluation of competing hypotheses.  These are the standing edge-wave model and the system self organization model.  For more than 20 years most coastal scientists have accepted the edge-wave theory.  Recent analyses suggest that self organization may provide a better explanation.  The research is designed to obtain the data necessary to discriminate between the two mechanisms.  Field investigation will be carried out at Malin Head, Ireland, where cusps are common and active along a stretch of gravel shoreline, and condition favor a resolution of this conflict.  Evaluations will require measurement and comparison of oscillatory currents and water surface fluctuations at several points adjacent to the foreshore, repetitive grid profiling, sediment sampling and measurement of swamp uprush.  Through these efforts the controversy over the origins of beach cusps can be resolved.  The research will expand our knowledge of several prominent beach morphology mechanisms.",
