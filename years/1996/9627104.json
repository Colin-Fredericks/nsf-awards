 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research on mechanisms of organometallic reactions by   Dr. Charles P. Casey of the Chemistry Department, University of Wisconsin   at Madison.  Three distinct areas of research will be pursued:    investigations of d-0 yttrium and zirconium olefin complexes; development   of pi-propargyl metal complexes; and the chemistry of rhenium carbene   complexes.  The systems chosen for the first area of investigation will   permit measurement of the rate of alkene dissociation and the rate of   inversion at the metal center.  This information is important for   understanding the stereochemistry of polymerization with chiral   metallocene catalysts.  Three methods of synthesis of the pi-propargyl   complexes will be investigated, as well as the reaction of nucleophiles   with these complexes, which have been shown to be  useful in organic   synthesis.  The stereochemistry of addition of HCl to rhenium carbene   complexes will be studied, along with the formation of some unusual   complexes designed to give information about modes of association of   metals with double-bonded carbon compounds and about using variation in   ring strain to favor formation of desired products.  Organometallic chemistry has proved to be very useful in homogeneous   catalysis and in developing new methods and reagents for synthesis of   organic compounds.   The reactions chosen for investigation are relevant   to the behavior of commercially important processes.",
