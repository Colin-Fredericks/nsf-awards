A variety  of research will be conducted by faculty in  several departments at Macalester and by members  of the Minnesota State Geological Survey and  faculty at Lawrence University.  Specific projects  that will utilize XRF analyses will include the  geochemical characterization of island arc and  intraplate volcanics from Alaska as indicators of  the tectonic evolution of this area, petrogenesis  of Proterozoic dike swarms in the Midcontinental  U.S., the geochemical evolution of Galapagos  hotspot magmas, characterization of silicon and  germanium-based thin films and trace metal  geochemistry of soils.  This grant provides this  undergraduate institution with a state-of-the-art  piece of research instrumentation which will have  a significant impact on the training of and fills  a regional gap where the capabilities of an XRF  were previously not easily accessible.  ***",
