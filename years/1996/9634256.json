 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634256  Joel Schneider    This is a planning grant to Children's Television Workshop (CTW) to develop further the science content in a proposed television series for 8-12 year olds entitled, The Wheel In Space.  This adventure series would be set on an orbiting space station 100 years in the future which, by definition is an enormous scientific and technological enterprise.  The planning period would be used to investigate how its complex systems and operations can best be used to illustrate principles and processes science.  Specific planning tasks include:    o Working with consultants in space science and other scientific disciplines as well as with organizations such as NASA and the National Air and Space Museum to explore the science and technology involved in the operation of a space station and to project what living, working, and growing up on a space station might be like a century from now.    o Writing a content \"bible\" that will serve as a technical guide to writers of the series.    o Writing a treatment of the series that outlines story premises that incorporate science topics.    o Investigating potential components of the project that may enhance the reach and impact of the television series.    o Examining the advantages and disadvantages of a co-production arrangement with Southern Star, a television production company in Australia interested in participating in the project.     The PI's for the project will be Joel Schneider who will serve as Content Director and Jeffrey Nelson who will be Executive Producer.  Both have worked on previous science and mathematics media projects at CTW.  A principal consultant will be Samuel Gibbon, producer and/or executive producer for Sesame Street, The Electric Company, 3-2-1 Contact, and The Voyage of the Mimi.",
