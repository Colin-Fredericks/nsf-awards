 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the project is to design a national model for multivariable calculus lab instruction which integrates the use of computers and the mathematical programs MAPLE V and MATHEMATICA into the teaching and learning of calculus. With the aid of this technology, students can move more quickly towards the application of ideas to problem solving.  The following was completed in Phase I of the project, supported by NSF award # 9452422:     1) creation of a public domain MAPLE library that contains various custom programs for the learning and teaching of multivariable calculus. This will be an electronic marketplace where experienced and inexperienced instructors can exchange ideas and experience.   2) developmelt  of Lab Manuals which will demonstrate how to use the customized MAPLE programs in the proposed library and help the inexperienced instructor to develop a computer instruction lab.          The focus of \"Phase II of the project\" will be:     1) development of the MATHEMATICA version of the project, and   2) dissemination of materials and  results found in class-testing.",
