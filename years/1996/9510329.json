 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9510329  Bartz       This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will design, build and field test a Robotic Observation Microscope (ROM) System able to gather, name, and store the root images in digital format in the field.  The system will be designed to return to each location within plus or minus 0.1mm for rapid comparison of images with no loss of data because edges do not match. Provisions will be incorporated to enable interaction with field operators for quality verification of data, and to allow operators to input comments and add data, while the program continues to perform all normal repetitive tasks, only requiring approval to proceed to the next step.  The system will also be designed to reprogram index depth intervals, sample points, magnification, and other research project features, to fit the future needs of different scientists and automatically transfer images from the field system to a laboratory database, and backup archive storage system..  It will provide easy location indexed, then time indexed, retrieval of all images.  The target is to produce a system that can be purchased for less than $25,000 total system price.  These developments would enable savings of 30% to 50% of the time presently required for MiniRhizotron research and add new observational capabilities.        Root research is conducted to study root growth, to breed drought resistance of food crops, to study root response to soil conditions and contamination, and for research on disease mechanisms.  Improving food production is of major importance in the United States and it is a matter of survival in many third world countries.  This method of root study is the primary accepted non-destructive approach around the world.  The firm specializes in development of this method, and manufactures the equipment for export world wide. There are about 100 manual systems now in use.  ***",
