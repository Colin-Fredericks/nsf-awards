The scientific community is entering  an  era  in  which public investment in basic research and higher education is  projected  to decrease significantly.  As a result, opportunities  for  new PhDs to follow traditional academic research careers are  also  expected  to decrease. Given these realities,  it  is  both  essential  and timely to re-examine the role of graduate  schools  in  serving  our discipline, our students, and the society  which  supports  the discipline of astronomy. Central to the  discussion  are the questions: (1) What should be the goals, and content,  of  an  astronomy  graduate education in view of (a) the discipline's  need  to  continue  a  tradition  of  carrying  out  world  class  research,   and   (b)   our   nation's  need   for   imaginative,  scientifically capable and adaptable young people,  both  in  the  technical workforce and as teachers in the nation's schools?   2)  Should  we  consider  changing academic institutions'  admissions  policies,  graduate  curricula,  funding  patterns  or   academic  culture to meet the needs of (a) the discipline of astronomy, and  (b)  the  nation?  The AAS will open this dialog at the  upcoming  bi-annual  AAS  meeting.  The AAS will 1) conduct three  regional  workshops during 1996 with astronomy department chairs,  selected  graduate   students,  invited  members  of  the   education   and  industrial  communities,  and representatives  from  the  physics  community  involved in similar self-examination; 2)  publish  and  disseminate  a  report  summarizing  the  discussions,  outlining  possible   models  for  restructuring  graduate  curricula,   and  suggesting changes in funding patterns to stimulate or facilitate  restructuring;  and  3)  design an employment  database  to  help  graduate students make realistic and  informed career choices, and  to  help  graduate  departments guide  admissions,  funding,  and  curricular policies.  ***",
