 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dermatoglyphic traits develop during the second trimester in utero, and are excellent markers  for second trimester antenatal environmental events.  Recent research has demonstrated that a  monozygotic twin model employing dermatoglyphics may be used to determine whether  antenatal environmental conditions influence the etiology of complex bio-behavioral traits  during the second trimester.  This model has been successfully applied in a study of  schizophrenia.  Identical twins discordant for schizophrenia (ie., one twin had the disease while  the other did not) were also discordant for total finger ridge count. As monzygotic twins are  usually concordant for this dermatoglyphic trait, an environmental event is implicated.  This   event would have to occur during the second trimester and may play a role in the etiology of  schizophrenia, as well as in the development of dermatoglyphic traits.    The present study will use this monozygotic twin-dermatoglyphic model to determine whether  there is evidence of a second trimester antenatal environmental component in the etiology of  other complex behaviors in males.  This study will also collect data on other characteristics  associated with antenatal development, such as handedness and birth-weight.",
