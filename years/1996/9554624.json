 "awd_abstract_narration": "Georgia State University (GSU) and the Georgia Institute of  Technology (GIT) jointly propose an Undergraduate Faculty  Enhancement project in chemistry; recruitment of participants is to  be on a national basis. The project is designed to improve the  ability of faculty primarily at two- and four-year, public and  private, institutions to develop and teach a modern program in  chemistry.  The major activities of the proposed project are 11  five-day workshops and two annual reunions of the previous year's  participants.  Workshop topics are (1) Advanced Materials  Chemistry, (2) Chemistry of Nucleic Acids, (3) Environmental  Chemistry, (4) Mass Spectrometry, (5) Molecular Modeling, (6)  Molecular Orbital Theory, (7) Multidimensional Nuclear Magnetic  Resonance Spectroscopy, and (8) Multimedia Techniques in Chemistry.   The workshops will be taught primarily by GSU and GIT faculty;  members of the faculty from Indiana University, the University of  Georgia and the University of California at Irvine will also  participate.  Several former workshop participants will serve as  assistants in these activities.  Prominent specialists from other  institutions and industry will serve as keynote speakers.  The  reunions are designed to allow participants to share their  experiences in implementing project material into their curricula.   Over a two-year period, 900 participant-days are scheduled.  A  compilation of all innovations in the chemistry curriculum at  participating institutions resulting from the project will be  distributed to all participants.",
