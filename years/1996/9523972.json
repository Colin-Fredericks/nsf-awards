 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software systems keep growing in size and complexity. Our  reliance on such systems is likewise increasing, making it  critical that they obey the properties their designers  intended. Because these properties are global, their  consideration cannot be left to the implementation of  modules; rather, they must be ensured by design early on.  Achieving critical properties thus depends on being able to  analyze designs, so that the consequences of design choices  can be explored without the cost of implementation, and  potentially disastrous flaws can be caught while their  repair is still relatively cheap.    Analysis methods based on formal, rather than informal,  techniques are amenable to mechanical reasoning. Formal  methods have had a dramatic impact in hardware verification  -- principally due to the success of model checking -- and  are being adopted by industry. In software development, on  the other hand, formal methods have not yet had the same  impact. This is largely because little tool support has been  available. Almost any analysis of a software specification  seems to require theorem proving. Theorem proving is not  feasible for most software developments, since it requires  highly skilled proof experts, and cannot be automated fully.  Without automatic analysis, formal specification is much  less attractive to practitioners.    This project has two aspects.  First, it investigates the  application of model checking techniques to software. This  involves both the identification of appropriate abstract  representations of large systems, along with the properties  they should obey, and the invention of new abstraction  techniques to relate such representations to software  designs.    The abstraction techniques pursued in this research arise in  three ways: (1) from the form of the property to be checked  (for example, merging states to preserve a universally  quantified property); (2) from the application area (for  example, not distinguishing the varieties of failure in a  distribu ted system); and (3) from the application itself  (for example, abstracting the data held in cache lines in  the evaluation of a cache protocol).    Second, new checking techniques are being developed for  specifications that are not currently well served by model  checking. Software designs often involve operations on  complex data structures that are defined implicitly. In this  case, there is no apparent model to be checked; rather, it  is necessary to generate models from the specification and  determine whether they satisfy intended properties. The  project is developing a language, NP, that is roughly a  subset of the Z specification language, and a checker,  Nitpick, that can both simulate the execution of operations  specified implicitly and check inductive properties of  operations, by generating models of a relational formula.    While emphasizing principles that are expected to find  broader application, the project is driven by realistic case  studies: railway switching, telephone features, and security  protocols. ***",
