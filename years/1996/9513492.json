The meeting will include 4 three-hour sessions of presented talks, planned and chaired by leaders in the field.  Additional events include the first Christian Anfinsen Lecture, a poster session, and the opportunity for informal exchanges.  Material from the meeting will be published in Proteins:  Structure, Function and Genetics.  %%%  Protein folding is the name given to the process by which protein molecules assume their normal functional form.  In cells protein molecules are manufactured in the form of flexibly, extended chains - rather like a microscopic piece of cooked spaghetti.  Each strand then spontaneously folds up into a compact ball that represents the active form of the protein molecule - the so-called native state.  The remarkable fact is that all the molecules of a particular protein fold up into exactly the same native state.   In contrast, if one folds up individual strands of spaghetti, say by putting them in a spoon, each of the strands will fold up in a different way.  Protein molecules are called chains because they are built up as a sequence of chemical links called amino acids.  there are 20 different amino acid types.  The information telling the protein how to fold up is contained in the sequence of the amino acids in the protein chain. The 1996 Johns Hopkins Protein Folding Meeting will gather together experts from all over the world to present and discuss new research on various aspects of protein folding.  Topics will include attempts to predict the native structure of a protein, and studies on the details of the actual folding process.  Funds are requested to defray the costs of attendance for speakers and students.  ***",
