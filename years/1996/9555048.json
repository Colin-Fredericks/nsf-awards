 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photonics is the use of photons to work with or replace  electrons in communications, computing, control, imaging,  and information processing.  Milwaukee School of Engineering  has initiated a significant program to incorporate the  principles and applications of modern optics and photonics  into the introductory and intermediate physics and  engineering courses.  An important part of this program is  the continuing development of new laboratories in  Undergraduate Applied Optics, Photonics and Sensors, and  High Speed Vidography.    The main goal of the proposed curricular development program  will be the creation of a set of modern optics and photonics  laboratory Modules for use in undergraduate physics and  engineering programs. Modules will be developed for 20  topics including beam splitters, Fabry-Perot  interferometers, fiber optics, speckle optics, high speed  videography, and spatial ffltering. Some of these modules  will include associated computer-multimedia software  packages.  The modules will be designed to stimulate  students' enthusiasm and interest and to optimize their  conceptual understanding of the most important and  fundamental concepts in optics and photonics.  In accord  with the most recent pedagogical research, the concepts will  not only be embedded in the frameworks of basic principles  and history, but will also give students practical  experience with the tools and apparatus of modern optics and  photonics.  The design and evaluation of the modules will be  accomplished by an interdisciplinary team of professors and  selected students with advice and guidance from Professor  Arthur Western of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and  Professor David Van Baak of Calvin College.  After a period  of testing and revision, the modules will be used in  Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement programs that we will  offer as part of our dissemination plan.  Later we will use  the modules in outreach programs for pre-college teachers  and for engineers from industry.  The modula r approach will  provide the flexibility and adaptability that should ensure  use of the modules by a wide variety of institutions, since  each school may incorporate one or more modules into their  existing courses, or may use a collection of modules as  substrates to develop their own new courses.",
