At a high level, this research aims to develop a methodology for the computer representation of complex objects such as bone surfaces.    Anthropologists and bio-medical engineers are restricted for lack of mathematical structure of data that can be analyzed, an example being the surfaces of bones.  Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) techniques will be applied to convert this unstructured data into a structured form.  Dense point cloud data will be used to describe the discretized surfaces as a smooth parametric NURB (Non Uniform Rational B Spline) surface(s).  Data reduction techniques will be developed to reduce the amount of data required to describe the surface(s).  3D tools will be developed to facilitate interrogation and analysis of these surfaces, to quantify measures  such as curvature.  The research will collaborate with a physical anthropologist at the new inter-disciplinary facility on campus, called PRISM.  The surface models will also generate the STL (stereolithography format) files for 3D hard copy outputs on rapid prototyping machines.  These can be used as tactile models for research into human morphology and the teaching of comparative anatomy and bio-engineering courses.",
