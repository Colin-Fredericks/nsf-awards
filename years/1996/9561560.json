 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed toward the development of a method for producing seedless fruit from a hybrid variety while retaining seeded fruit production from the parental inbreds.  The strategy is to allow fertilization but to block seed development soon thereafter through the seed coat-specific expression of a cell lethal function, the ribonuclease barnase.  Barnase expression has been shown to block cell growth and development in specific plant tissues.  A normally monomeric enzyme, barnase will be synthesized as two partial peptides encoded by separate synthetic genes, each of which will be present in one parental inbred.  In this way, the commercial fruit product is seedless, yet commercial seed production of a seed-propagated crop would not be impaired.  For the purpose of the initial test, tomato plants will be transformed separately with each chimeric gene, using different selectable markers for each gene.  To determine whether cell viability is disrupted when the two chimeric genes are expressed together, one chimeric gene will be introduced through biollistics into leaf tissue already transformed with the other chimeric gene.  Later, a pair of lines, each expressing one partial barnase gene will be crossed to each other to confirm that no progeny are obtained in which both genes are expressed, based on resistance to the linked markers.  The overall project goal is to apply this method to watermelon to create diploid hybrid varieties producing seedless fruits.  To ensure that this can be achieved, the ability to transform watermelon, based on published methods, will be evaluated during Phase I research.       The use of fertile but seedless diploids should reduce costs of production since triploid seedless watermelon production requires that a portion of yield be sacrificed to a pollen source due to the pollen-deficiency of triploid varieties.  In addition, the time and cost to develop new seedless watermelon varieties would be reduced by eliminating the need to produce a tetraploid parent.  Finally, this method for creating seedless varieties will have value in other seed-propagated crops, such as cherry and papaya, and it may be extended to vegetatively-propagated crops such as grape.",
