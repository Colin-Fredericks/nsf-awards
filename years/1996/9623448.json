The STM is used for in-situ cleavage of high-Tc  materials.  Preliminary  STM study  of  the  clean  surfaces  has  revealed  novel  structural features and an reproducible  gap  in  YBCO  materials.  The  origin  of  the  structural  features   is  uncertain  and will be further investigated in this project.  The  instrument  capabilities will be improved to allow a  lower  base  operating  temperature, and lower noise.  This  will  expand  the  range  superconducting  materials that can  be  investigated.  Of  particular  interest  are  measurement of  vortex  structure  and  charge  density waves in superconductors. This is  a  fundamental  project.  The  results will be of significance  for  theories  of  superconductivity,   and  may  lead   to   development   of   new  superconducting materials.  %%%  This  project  will  continue development of a surface  structure  determination tool, a scanning tunneling microscope (STM),  which  has  unique capabilities. With this instrument it is possible  to  take a small single crystal of a high-Tc superconductor, cool  it  to  very  low temperatures (20 K), cleave the crystal, and  study  the  surface  structure  with the STM  at  the  low  temperature.  Preliminary  data  have revealed unusual structural  features  in  high-Tc  materials whose origin is uncertain, but which certainly  relevant to mechanisms of high-Tc superconductivity. This project  will  clarify the nature of the structural properties of  several  high-Tc  materials, and will study the temperature dependence  of  the  phenomena. The instrument will be further developed to allow  a  lower  base  temperature, which will  increase  the  range  of  superconducting  materials that can be investigated.  This  is  a  fundamental project in condensed  matter physics. The results will  be  of  significance for theories of superconductivity,  and  may  lead to development of new superconducting materials.  ***",
