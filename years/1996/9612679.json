 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request has been made for funding to help offset the cost of travel, living expenses and registration fees for US participants in a joint US-France workshop on premixed turbulent combustion.  This workshop will focus on the study, structure, modeling and simulation of the flamelet regime associated with premixed turbulent combustion, and will bring together the leading experts in this field in the US and France.  The workshop will attempt to develop a consensus view of the current state of knowledge and of where research efforts should be directed.  This is a timely request since the need to understand premixed turbulent combustion is becoming more and more important because it offers the possibility of better control of combustion generated pollution and the mitigation of the resulting environmental problems.  This meeting is to be held on December 7, 8, 1996 in Hilton Head, SC.",
