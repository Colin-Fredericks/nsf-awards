 "awd_abstract_narration": "The search for efficient algorithms to produce primes is  motivated largely by the needs of cryptologists and number  theorists.  Many open problems in these areas rely on very large  tables of primes for their solution.  The Sieve of Erathosthenes  is a well known method for generating tables of primes up to a  given natural number, N.  Significant work has been published  that improves on the original sieve to generate primes, some in  sublinear time.  This project will investigate six variations on  the sieve to generate large tables of primes efficiently using  parallel architectures.  Initial testing and implementation of  the algorithms will be based on selected mapping and  communication structures that are determined to be optimal.  The  most effective architecture will be identified for each  algorithm.  Preliminary data will give insight into the scope of  memory limitations that must be addressed in order to generate  primes to N = 10^18.  Break even points between the various  algorithms will be provided because it is important to determine  how feasible it is to reach a certain point given a particular  algorithm.  ***",
