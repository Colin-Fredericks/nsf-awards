 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531719  Lin  Engineering structures are often exposed to dynamic random  excitations which can only be described in terms of probability and  statistics.  Examples of such excitations include seismic ground  accelerations, turbulent winds, ocean waves, and traffic loads.  It  has also been well recognized that most structures need not be or  should not be designed for eternal life; otherwise, the required  size may be too large to be practical, or the cost too high.  Thus  the possibility of large deformation and failure must be considered  in the design.  The choice must then be made for the optimal total  cost within a desired minimum service life of a structural system,  including the costs of initial construction, maintenance and  repair, costs associated with interruption of service, etc.     The problem of a randomly excited structures undergoing large  deformation is a difficult one, since nonlinear behaviors of the  structure must be taken into account.  For nonlinear structures,  known exact analytical solutions are, by an large restricted to the  case of single degree of freedom under white noise excitations.  Extension to the case of multiple degrees of freedom is successful  only under additional severe restrictions.      The PI plans to develop new advanced analytical techniques to  obtain the response statistics and probability of failure for  multi-degree-of-freedom nonlinear structural systems under random  dynamical excitations.  Both geometrical and material  nonlinearities will be considered.",
