 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wiens and Zhao  OPP 9527366    Abstract    The present day tectonics and seismological structure of the  Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia plate region are among the most  poorly understood of any location in the world.  This region  offers a unique and complex geodynamic setting, as illustrated by  the recent cessation of volcanism along the South Shetland Trench  and onset of volcanism and rifting in the Bransfield Strait, the  possible presence of diffuse deformation and/or microplates in  the Drake Passage region, and fast back-arc spreading behind the  South Sandwich Arc.    This award supports the US component of an international effort  to study the seismotectonics and seismic structure of the  Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea regions using a large scale  deployment of broad band seismographs beginning during the 1996-  1997 field season.  The project will deploy 9 broadband PASSCAL  seismographs for 2 years in the Antarctic Peninsula region,  Southernmost Chile, and South Georgia Island.    The following questions will be addressed:  1)  Is there seismological evidence, in the form of either  subduction zone  earthquakes or seismic structure, for current subduction beneath  the Antarctic Peninsula?  2)  Is there evidence from seismic anisotropy for large scale  mantle flow around South America into the South Atlantic?  3)  Are regional earthquakes and focal mechanisms consistent with  current kinematic models for the Scotia plate, which imply  compressional deformation in the Drake Passage region?  4)  What is the deep structure of the South Sandwich subduction  zone?  5)  What is the seismological structure of active back-arc  spreading centers in the Bransfield Strait and South Sandwich  regions?    Answering these questions will help to constrain important  tectonic questions such as the cause of plate motion changes,  what processes initiate back arc spreading, and the relationship  between mantle flow and surface tectonics.",
