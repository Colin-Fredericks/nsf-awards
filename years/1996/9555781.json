 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-55781  James    During each of five years 30-middle school science teachers will participate in  a 3-week  research experience at one of 8 United States Department of Agriculture laboratory sites in Texas.  Teachers will spend the first two weeks of the summer and the fifth week working with a mentoring scientist. Between weeks two and three teachers will participate in a 2-week workshop integrating science and pedagogy using pedagogy as the vehicle for science content.. Academic year follow-up sessions are coupled to state science conventions or done via the Trans-Texas-Video Network. Teachers participating as team will be come from the Southern Plains region. Individual teachers will be expected to develop a mini-research project that can be done by students in their classroom; the objective here is to translate the research experience into the classroom.    A long range goal of the project is to establish Science Learning Resource Centers at each collaborating USDA lab site.",
