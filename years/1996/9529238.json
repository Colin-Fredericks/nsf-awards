 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores through several inter-related activities the uses and abuses of anonymous communications on the internet.  The benefits and drawbacks of anonymous computer communication are just now beginning to be examined,  an examination rendered more difficult by the fact that the value of anonymous communication in a non-networked environment is itself a matter of debate.  Nevertheless, a growing number of computer and network professionals, lawyers, social scientists, and ethicists agree that anonymity is an important issue that needs to be addressed from a variety of perspectives. Building on an earlier project focusing on the ethical, legal, and technological aspects of computer and network use and abuse, the American Association for the Advancement of  Science (AAAS) plans to develop 1)criteria setting forth contexts in which anonymous communications are desirable (to be encouraged), permissible (to be tolerated), or undesirable (to be discouraged), and 2) preliminary guidelines for those situations where anonymity is to be either encouraged or tolerated.  AAA will conduct several interrelated activities: 1) background information and guidance will be provided through commissioned  papers on such topics as the individual and social uses and ramifications of anonymous communications, legal issues regarding anonymity, and the current and anticipated technical capabilities pertinent to anonymity on the net; 2) development of case studies based on individual experiences with anonymity; 3) convening of focus groups to frame issues for a two-day conference at which invited individuals from a variety of professional backgrounds and perspectives will discuss criteria and guidelines that can form the basis for normative and legal standards regarding anonymity.  Results will be disseminated in a number of forms, including the World Wide Web page.",
