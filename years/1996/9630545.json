 "awd_abstract_narration": "Werner-Washburne  9630545  The long-term objective of this research is to gain insight into the molecular events involved in the process of entry into, survival during, and exit from stationary-phase growth in yeast.  The goal of the research is to increase our understanding of developmental regulation of signal-transduction pathways in stationary phase:  first, by studying the regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and, second, by identifying other pathways and targets of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase that function during stationary phase.  The cAMP-dependent protein kinase is extremely dynamic as yeast cells enter stationary phase and down-regulation of the kinase activity is essential for survival in stationary phase, since strains carrying mutations in the regulatory subunit have been characterized that lose viability specifically in stationary phase.  Although stationary phase is the most common state for microorganisms and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is one of the best-studied kinases, we know very little about this time in the life cycle or how kinase activity is regulated in stationary phase.  The aims of this research are to extend the studies on the regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in stationary-phase yeast, identify and characterized proteins that interact with the kinase, and identify other pathways that act positive regulators of the stationary phase state in yeast.  This research will, therefore, help us to better understand how microorganisms function in nature.  It will also have possible benefit in the culturing of microorganisms at high cell concentrations, as is done in biotechnology applications of cell culture.",
