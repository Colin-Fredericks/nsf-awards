 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting   professor  Truong at the University of Utah.  The research to be conducted over the   next  three years involves the development and applications of new direct   ab-initio  dynamics methods for investigating potential energy surfaces, kinetics,   and  dynamics of gas-phase bimolecular reactions.  The dynamical method is   based on  Variational Transition State Theory augmented with several   multidimensional  semiclassical tunneling corrections.  Reaction path information will be  evaluated directly from a sufficiently accurate ab-initio or non-local   density  functional method, thus obviating the need for the construction of   analytical  potential functions which currently do not exist for most of the   reactions  under consideration.  A methodology for calculating vibrational-state   selected  rates will also be developed.   These new methods will be used to study the detailed dynamics of a   number of  radical reactions.  Most of the reactions under consideration involve   hydrogen  abstraction by species such as hydroxyl radical reacting with H2, or   methane.  Particular attention will be devoted in these investigations to the   effect of  reagent vibrational energy on the computed bimolecular reaction rates.    These  investigations will also attempt to correlate the topology of the   potential  An understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms of these reactions has  implications at both the fundamental as well as technological levels.  In   terms  of technology, these hydrogen abstraction reactions are of significance   in  combustion, environmental and atmospheric chemistry.  In terms of a   fundamental  chemical understanding, these reactions contain similar reaction   kinematics  with simple light-light-heavy (L-L-H) and heavy-light-heavy (H-L-H)   atom-diatom  reactions whose dynamics have been well studied.  Experiments on these  reactions are underway in different laboratories.  Hence, potential   energy  surface information resulting from this work will be valuable in aiding   the  interpretations of new experimental observations.",
