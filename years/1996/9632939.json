 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the Allerton Conference/Institute  on the uses of digital libraries. The study of how the new  resources, tools and services that fall under the rubric of  digital libraries are in fact being used is critical to help  assure that digital libraries are suitable for the tasks  they are meant to support.  The objectives for this  conference are to increase understanding of digital library  needs and uses, to improve participants skills in the  conduct of formative and summative digital library  evaluations, to share results of digital library use and  usability studies, and to provide an opportunity for digital  library researchers to meet and lay the foundations for  future interactions. These objectives will be met by  convening an interdisciplinary group of experts in  information system design and evaluation with others  currently involved in a wide range of digital library  projects. A specific aim is to connect the current Digital  Library Initiative projects with similar work conducted  around the world. The participants will present and discuss  results of their digital library use studies, hold small  group working sessions, and demonstrate new user interfaces  and online data collection techniques, and conduct  roundtable discussions of key research issues.",
