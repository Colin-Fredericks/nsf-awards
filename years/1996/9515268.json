 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to explore two central  and related topics in monetary economics.  First, how is our view  of the transmission mechanism between monetary policy and real  economic activity affected by the monetary policy rule that is  presumed to be in place?  Second, how do alternative monetary  policy rules affect the behavior of the private economy?    To conduct this line of inquiry, the principal investigator will  use a set of recently developed tools that make it  straightforward to study alternative monetary policy rules in  dynamic models with rational expectations and forward-looking  consumption, investment, labor supply and price-setting  decisions.  The analytical framework is a singular linear  difference system under rational expectations; theoretical  characterization of this system and computational methods for its  solution have been developed by the principal investigator in  recent collaborative research.    Specific rules to be studied include interest rate and money  stock rules for monetary policy, with particular attention  devoted to how these alternative specifications influence the  evaluation of models of the transmission mechanism between  monetary policy and the real economy.  Particular attention will  be devoted to conditions under which pure interest rate rules can  actually be implemented.  In addition, the research will also  undertake evaluation of an inflation targeting regime.",
