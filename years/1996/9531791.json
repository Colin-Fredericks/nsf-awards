For the period 1996-98, eight   undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged   in basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry   and biochemistry. Faculty members from both Dillard University and the   University of Northern Iowa will participate at the Iowa campus and   direct research projects designed for undergraduates.  Students will be   recruited from both the Louisiana and midwestern regions of the U. S.    The faculty and student community will have weekly seminars, field trips,   weekend social events, and a final symposium.",
