Session content addresses issues of  importance in preparing graduates for environmental engineering  practice.  Sessions scheduled include consideration of the  attributes expected of program graduates in terms the market for  their services, educational approaches and curricula for meeting  practitioner perceptions and needs, roles of practitioners in  enhancing the content of curricula and the role of practitioners  in influencing innovations in education of engineers for  environmental engineering practice.  The conference will be conducted at the University of Maine from  August 3-6, 1996 by the Association of Environmental Engineering  Professors under auspices of the University of Maine in joint  sponsorship with the American Academy of Environmental Engineers.  Results are expected to be used for program planning.",
