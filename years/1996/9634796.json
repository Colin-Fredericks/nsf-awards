 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops an overhead crane control system for  precision transport and assembly operations. The crane  system provides an excellent testbed for the development of  advanced control theory for nonlinear, distributed,  mechatronic systems. The crane model includes a nonlinear,  distributed cable and typically an electrical drive motor.  The theory can then be applied to many similar systems, such  as smart structures, flexible rotors supported by magnetic  bearings, and high speed material transport machinery.  Overhead cranes have higher load capacity, larger workspace,  simpler position monitoring, and easier obstacle avoidance  than forklifts or Automatic Guided Vehicle. The poor payload  position and orientation control of overhead cranes has  limited their application in precision transport and  assembly operations. Due to the flexible cable, the payload  of an overhead crane swings during transit, making manual  remote positioning difficult and damage or injury possible.  In manufacturing environments, high speed response, accurate  tracking, and good stability margins are desired. The lumped  and distributed model controllers advanced in this research  are based on Lyapunov theory. This research studies the  fusion of the lumped and distributed Lyapunov techniques for  the full nonlinear, distributed model. Additionally, the  `low-pass filter-like` electrical dynamics tend to filter  out part of the high-frequency component of the controller.  While high-gain current feedback tends to partially null out  this filtering effect, this research targets the design of  backstepping-type controllers which exactly compensate for  the effects of the electrical dynamics. The specific  research objectives are to:i) develop saturation controllers  for the electrically-driven, nonlinear rigid cable model;  ii) investigate implementable boundary controllers for the  linear distributed model; iii) accurately model the  nonlinear, flexible cable system; iv) develop control theory  for nonlinear, distributed, mechatronic systems; and v)  implement the controllers on a small-scale experiment in the  Robotics and Mechatronics Laboratory and a fullscale  overhead crane (DEMAG 5 ton) in the new Engineering  Innovation Building at Clemson University.",
