 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622870  Kac    This grant supports the research of Professor V. Kac to work on  various problems in representation theory and mathematical  physics. He will study the representation theory of the Lie  algebra of differential operators on the circle as well vertex  operators, quantum groups and conformal quantum field theory. He  will also study soliton equations, integral representations of  affine superalgebras and the relationship between reciprocity  laws in number theory and the representation theory of infinite  dimensional groups.     This is research that starts out in the field of algebra but  moves beyond that to touch both number theory and theoretical  physics.  The reasons for these connections are that algebra can  be thought of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such  algebra has direct applications to areas of physics and  chemistry. In particular the modern theory of gauge fields in  physics uses this area of algebra extensively and this project  will study some of these connections at length. There are also  connections to coding theory and the transmission of data across  communication lines.",
