 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602141  Edie   Description:  The proposed research  \"Photoinduced Degradation in Doped Hydrogenated  Amorphous Silicon (a-SiLH)\" is a collaboration  in condensed matter physics between Professor  Taylor, University of Utah and Professors  Mathur and Mahra, University of Delhi.  This  research adds an international dimension to  domestic research programs on electronic and  structural properties of disordered  semiconductors, and on the electronic  properties of thin-film photovaltaic materials.   The proposed research is a logical extension of  that research and will concentrate on the  photo-induced degradation and transport  properties of n-type doped silicon-sulfur  alloys.  Taylor has made significant progress  in understanding metal chalcogenide glasses as  a model system linking tetrahedrally-  coordinated amorphous materials and traditional  chalcogenide glasses.       Scope:  This is a new collaboration linking two  university research laboratories in the US and  India.  The research combines the expertise at  the University of Utah on growth, optical  characterization and magnetic resonance  characteriation with the expertise at the  University of Delhi on transport measurements  and structural measurements.  The research plan  is designed to make progress on ultimately  improving the stability of devices such as  thin-film transistors and solar cells.   ***",
