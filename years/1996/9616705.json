This meeting  will provide a forum for the in depth discussion of detailed  questions in the research and education aspects of the mechanics  and materials area.  The conference will actually include a wide  range of disciplines with many interactions being likely.  It is  expected that 700-800 scientists and engineers will attend.   Therefore the students will be able to learn from their peers and  leaders in their fields.  ***",
