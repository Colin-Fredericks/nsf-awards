The meeting will be held in Knoxville, Tennessee from July 14-19, 1996.  The Symposium is being held under the auspices of the International Society if Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions (ISMPMI).  The faculty of the Center for Legume Research at the University of Tennessee is serving as the local organizing committee.  A program is being developed in conjunction with the officers and board of the ISMPMI, as well as a distinguished International Advisory Board.  This symposium held on a biennial basis is generally considered the premier meeting in which to present research results pertaining to the molecular biology of plant-microbe interactions.  Funds are requested to offset speaker costs and to provide fellowship money for  graduate students, scientists from developing countries, and faculty and students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities.",
