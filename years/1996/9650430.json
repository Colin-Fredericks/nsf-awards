 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is intended to improve the teaching and understanding of human movement in undergraduate exercise science and physical education courses and the quality of independent and advanced studies. The project provides funds to assist in purchasing a Force Platform System.  The Force Platform System provides for qualitative and quantitative kinetic analysis of human movement and for graphical data to be superimposed on video images of human performance.  Course instruction is enhanced by the system since mechanical principles are presented graphically in relation to skill acquisition, injury mechanisms, and abnormal movement patterns.  Future teachers, exercise specialists, and health care professionals can benefit from course enhancement. The Force Platform System complements an updated Video Analysis System (Peak Performance) currently housed in the Human Performance Laboratory. Students are able to conduct independent projects quantifying both kinematic (movement patterns) and kinetic (forces affecting movement) components of human performance. The principal investigator has been actively involved in using and upgrading her expertise in both regular duties and special sabbatical leave projects. The university's location and local community involvement provide for numerous outreach opportunities.",
