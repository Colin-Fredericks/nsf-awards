Current approaches to automating event correlation are slow, sensitive to noise in their data, and cannot dynamically adapt to a networked system's topology changes. The Codebook approach uses coding theory as the base of a novel correlation process that is high speed, robust to noise, and dynarnically adapts to system changes. The key idea is that since problems are characterized by the symptoms they cause, it suffices to monitor the minimal set of symptoms that uniquely identify (\"encode\"\") the problems of interest. Real-time correlation processing is thus reduced to a fast process of minimal distance \"decoding\" of symptoms. Symptoms can be added to make codes \"error-correcting\", for robustness with respect to noise in the event stream.              Potential market areas for this project are:  1.automated problem management products for enterprise networks, reducing exposure of mission critical applications to network down time. 2. Automated network management solutions for network service providers, increasing quality of service while reducing operations costs. 3. Selfhealing network, system and application  ***",
