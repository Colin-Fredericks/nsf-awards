 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN:  9634314  PI: John Clark    The research will seek a deeper understanding of how neural systems   represent and process information about the world, by applying   established principles of information theory and statistical inference   in the context of a large body of neurobiological observations.  The   basic hypothesis to be explored is that probabilistic information about   meaningful variables (such as measures of visual depth, optical flow,   limb orientation, etc.) is encoded in the firing rates of an ensemble   of neurons.  Bayesian inference then provides an optimal framework for   inference in the presence of uncertainty, given certain prior knowledge   that may be determined genetically or through learning processes.  This  approach leads in a natural way to neuronal circuits that are computationally   more general than the standard input-output maps of neural-network theory.   For example, an explanation of experiments demonstrating contextual or   attentional influences on neuronal responses may be formulated in terms  of a network involving multiplicative synaptic interactions.  Specific   thrusts of the research will include (i) the study of small-scale neuronal   circuits that illustrate the computational power of the model and furnish   prototypes for large-scale simulation of important brain subsystems and   (ii) the incorporation of learning rules that permit naive circuits to   modify their structure and optimize task performance.  Cross-disciplinary   in nature, the project will join the expertise of a computational   neuroscientist and a theoretical physicist in work to be performed   primarily in the laboratory of a prominent neurophysiologist.  Central  to the project is the involvement of physics graduate students in a   new interdisciplinary training program in computational neuroscience.",
