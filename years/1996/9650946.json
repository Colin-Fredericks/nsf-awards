 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop an undergraduate digital microprocessor laboratory for electrical engineering technology students. Until now, electronics courses have not offered practical laboratory experience in digital design. A series of experiments has been developed that effectively accomplishes this goal. Twelve workstations are being acquired. Each station consists of a Pentium-class personal computer equipped with a 68HC11 EVB microprocessor development board, a Universal Design Lab Platform experiment board, and ORCADTM software for logic verification and printed circuit layout.   Students now receive hands-on experiences in basic digital electronics and microprocessor hardware design. Students are able to conceive, design, and simulate digital circuits. The new laboratory experiences serve as part of a revised and updated digital electronics and microprocessor courses and can consolidate, add, reinforce, and update the skills taught in the old sequence of design courses.",
