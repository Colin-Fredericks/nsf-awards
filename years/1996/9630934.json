 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630934  Wood    The  physiological responses of trees to root pathogens, and  the  resulting  effects  on plant-feeding insect behavior  are  poorly  understood.  The studies outlined here aim to characterize:       1)      the  biochemical  changes  in  ponderosa  pine  (Pinus  ponderosa)  in  response to annosus root disease  (Heterobasidion  annosum),  emphasizing induced changes in parts of the  tree  not  infected by the fungus (i.e., systematic induction).  Preliminary  evidence  indicates  that a systemic response occurs,  especially  with  respect  to  stilbenes,  and  that  these  substances   are  associated with development of disease symptoms.  Greenhouse  and  field  experiments  will be carried out to  further  characterize  this unexpected and novel phenomenon in conifers.       2)      the  influence of compounds produced by  the  host  in  response  to the root pathogen (including stilbenes and ethylene,  among  others),  and  by  the pathogen  itself,  on  bark  beetle  behavior  mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and  the  western  pine  beetle (D. brevicomis) (Coleoptera:  Scolytidae) .  The  role of compounds produced during the physiological response  of  the  host  tree  to the root pathogen as  attractants  and/or  feeding  stimulants will be determined in the laboratory and  the  field,  in  order  to  better understand how these  bark  beetles  detect suitable host tissue for colonization.       This   work  will  significantly  advance  our  knowledge   of  fundamental  ecophysiological interactions, integrating  partners  as diverse as fungal pathogens, forest trees, and associated bark  beetles.  A greater knowledge of this three way interaction  will  also   ultimately  lead  to  a  greater  understanding  of  other  plant/herbivore systems and provide the basis for elucidating the  physiological  mechanisms  of  host  resistance  to   herbivores.  Hence,  this investigation may also result in modified strategies  for  forest disease and bark beetle man agement, based  on  better  knowledge of tree decline and the role of host physiopathology in  bark beetle colonization.",
