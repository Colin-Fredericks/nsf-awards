This series of week long workshops over three years will prepare scientists to become effective partners in the reform of elementary science education on both a strategic/planning and tactical/implementation level.  In addition, the education division of the American Physical Society will help to broker these scientists with school districts who need their support.  Other shorter workshops in this series will be supported by the Society.    Cost sharing will be 68% of the NSF funds.",
