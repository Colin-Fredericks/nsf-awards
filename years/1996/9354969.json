 "awd_abstract_narration": "Signal transduction is emerging as an important principle underlying much of plant development  and adaptation to the environment.  Signaling often involves multiple levels of response, from  organ, tissue and cell interactions to events at the level of membranes, cytoplasm and gene  expression.  In our view, the most informative analyses of signal transduction involve  multidisciplinary approaches where the signal is characterized through its multiple levels and  forms of expression (genetic, biochemical, physical, physiological, etc.)  We propose to establish  a graduate training program with innovations in our instructional approach and research guidance  with faculty from six (6) departments to pursue collaborative research across multiple levels of  signal transduction.  Toward this goal, we will develop a problem-based learning course to  explore multiple facets of plant signal transduction.  Graduate students will engage in  multidisciplinary research by attacking research problems at the interface of two (or more)  research efforts.  An annual Distinguished Investigator seminar/workshop series and concluding  international symposium will provide additional opportunity for student development.  Our  program will enrich the background and \"tool-kit\" available to the next generation, as well as  the current generation, of researchers to investigate the mechanisms by which plants develop and  react to their environment.",
