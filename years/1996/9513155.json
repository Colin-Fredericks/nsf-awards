 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513155  Kowalczykowski    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Dr. Hideo Shinagawa of Osaka University,  Japan and Dr. Stephen Kowalczykowski, University of  California, Davis, USA. The major goal of this project is to  biochemically reconstitute the process of genetic  recombination, using purified protein and DNA components.  Genetic recombination is complex biological process whose  mechanism is not understood. Yet, it is this process that  results in the assortment of genes which gives rise to  genetic diversity. Further, if harnessed properly,  recombination can be exploited either to repair defective  genes that underlie certain human diseases or to genetically  engineer agriculturally important plants or animals. Genetic  recombination underlies one of the major approaches to gene  targeting.    The proposal brings together the efforts of two major  laboratories that have constituted different parts of the  process: the Kowalczykowski laboratory, which has reproduced  the initial steps of the recombination in vitro, and the  Shinagawa laboratory which has reconstructed the latter  steps. It is anticipated that collaboration of these two  laboratories will achieve the first in vitro reconstitution  of genetic recombination. Furthermore, through the exchange  of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base  of basic knowledge and promote international understanding  and cooperation.  ***",
