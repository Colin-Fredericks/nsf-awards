 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634241  Lonsdale    This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux  Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1) a better  understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic and  inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the physical,  ecological and biogeochemical factors and processes which  regulate the magnitude and variability of these fluxes, and (3)  placing these fluxes into the context of the contemporary global  carbon cycle.    A major role for nanoplankton (2-20 um) and microplanktonic (20-  200 um) protozoa in pelagic food webs of the world ocean has been  firmly established in recent years.  Neritic and coastal ocean  ecosystems have been extensively studied in this regard, and  considerable information is also accumulating on the microbial  processes of tropical and temperate oceanic ecosystems.  In  contrast, the role of nano-and microzooplankton in the flow of  energy and elements through polar communities is less clear  because of the difficulties associated with sampling and working  in these environments, and because of the prevailing dogma that  microbial processes may be overshadowed by `classical'  phytoplankton-zooplankton-fish food webs in these environments.  Clearly, there is now a great deal of information that is  contradictory to this dogma, and numerous studies in recent years  have documented an abundant and active protozoan fauna in polar  ecosystems.  Nevertheless, there are still substantial gaps in  our understanding of the overall importance of the microbial loop  in polar environments.  This research project will examine  questions concerning the ecological role of nano- and  microplanktonic protozoa in the water column of the Ross Sea:  (1) Do nano- and microplanktonic protozoa constitute a  significant fraction of the zooplankton community in the Ross  Sea?  (2) Are these protozoa responsible for maintaining low  phytoplankton and bacterial standing stocks in this environment?  (3) Is mixotrophy (i.e., combined phototrophic  and phagotrophic  nutrition) an important adaptive behavior for the survival of  protists in this planktonic Antarctic ecosystem?  Studies will be  conducted over an annual cycle in the Ross Sea in order to  examine the expected strong seasonal variability in these  features of protistan ecology.  These studies constitute both  \"core\" JGOFS measurements and supplementary studies designed to  establish the seasonal contribution of protozoan biomass and  grazing activity to the overall structure of the pelagic food web  of the Ross Sea.",
