 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9601173  Schwenk    Squamate  reptiles (lizards and snakes) have figured  prominently  in  the  growth of biological thought over the last fifty  years.  In  particular,  they have served as model organisms  in  studies  that  have  shaped  the  field  of vertebrate  ecology,  strongly  influencing the development of modern ecological theory.   It  is  now  universally acknowledged that much of the behavioral ecology  of  lizards  and  snakes  is directed  by  the  chemical  senses,  especially  the vomeronasal system (VNS).  Therefore, elucidation  of VNS function is a desirable goal within this broader context.    The  VNS  is  mediated  by paired sensory  receptors  called  the  vomeronasal (or Jacobson's) organs (VNO) which lie in  the  snout  just  above the palate.  In squamates the VNO are separated  from  the  nasal cavities but open directly to the oral cavity  through  two  tiny  holes in the palate.  They are stimulated by a  unique  behavior  called tongue-flicking (TF) during which the tongue  is  protruded  and  oscillated to varying degrees.   The  tongue  tip  samples environmental chemicals extra-orally, either from the air  or  from the ground, and delivers these chemicals to the openings  in the palate where they make their way to the VNO.    The  study will elucidate the anatomical and functional bases  of  VNS  function  in  a  representative species,  the  Gila  monster  (Heloderma suspectum).  Gila monsters are an ideal study  species  for  VNS  function because they retain an intermediate morphology  of  the  chemosensory apparatus that can serve  as  a  functional  baseline  for  future  comparative studies.   By  embodying  both  primitive  and  derived features, their morphology  and  behavior  provides  information that can be generalized  up  and  down  the  squamate evolutionary tree.    The  study will use dissection, histology and electron microscopy  to  examine  the  gross and microscopic anatomy  of  the  tongue-  vomeronasal system.  The morphological mode l generated from these  data  will  be  combined with functional data derived  from  high  speed cinegraphic (slow motion movie) and cineradiographic (x-ray  movie) analyses to create a functional-morphological model of (1)  tongue  protrusion  and  oscillation; (2) environmental  chemical  sampling;  (3) chemical delivery to the VNO.  This model  of  VNS  function  will  be  supplemented with a  theoretical/mathematical  model  of  how chemical molecules diffuse into the fluid  coating  the  tongue surface so that chemicals can be concentrated on  the  tongue during a tongue-flick. By clarifying the mechanism of  the  most   fundamental  sensory  system  in  squamate  reptiles,   an  important model group, this study should contribute substantively  to  our further understanding of how this and other animal groups  diversify through time.",
