SRI and several San Francisco Bay Area K-12 science professional development providers (six Lawrence Hall of Science programs, Life Science Program, California Science Project, and the Science Education of the Bay Area) will jointly develop a new vision of on-line professional development activities in a place where teachers with diverse interest, skills, and backgrounds can meet and learn from one another on any given day; where teachers can be exposed to not one but many education reform concepts and approaches;  where teachers can find quality resources in minutes rather than hours;  and add and annotate resources that they find useful.  The goals of this project are to (a) scale up from prototype to implementation and (b) to conduct the research needed to assess the utility of the concept and technology and inform the development of future collaborative on-line learning communities.",
