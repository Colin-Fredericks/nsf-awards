If this  hypothesis  is  correct,   then some or all of the impressive cognitive abilities  observed  in  primates should also occur in  non-primate  mammals  living   in  primate-like  societies.  Spotted  hyenas   (Crocuta  crocuta)  are  large carnivores that live in social  groups  like  those of old-world monkeys. Thus the social complexity hypothesis  predicts  that spotted hyenas should possess many or all  of  the  same  features of social intelligence as do these primates.  Here  we  propose  to  determine what spotted hyenas know  about  their  social  worlds, how they use this knowledge, and how  it  differs  from  that  described  for  monkeys by earlier  workers.  Subject  animals are members of one large hyena clan in  Kenya.  Age, sex,  kin relations, and social status are known for all natal animals,  and  most  adult clan members wear radio collars so they  can  be  regularly  relocated and observed. Using videotaped responses  of  hyena  subjects to playbacks of recorded vocalizations,  we  will  determine  whether  hyenas, like monkeys, can discriminate  among  conspecific vocalizations based on group membership, kinship, and  association  patterns.  A secondary goal of this research  is  to  continue on-going work on hormone-behavior relationships in free-  living  hyenas, and to supplement this with preliminary  analyses  of  patterns of variation in their immune system function.   This  research will generate three types of useful information: it will  (1)   elucidate  the  functions of  animal  intelligence  in  the  natural habitat, as well as the  selection pressures favoring  its  evolution,  (2)  yield  rare  data  documenting  the  extent   of  variation  in  disease exposure and immunocompetence  among  wild  animals,  and  (3)  enhance  understanding  of  carnivore  social  behavior  and  immunocompetence to facilitate decision-making  by  wildlife  managers  and  others concerned with  biodiversity  and  conservation of African ecosystems.",
