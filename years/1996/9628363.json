 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628363  Thurber    This research is to investigate the relationship between  earthquakes, of magnitudes about 3.3 and above, to creep events on  the Northern Gabilans section of the San Andreas fault (SAF) in  central California.  There has been an apparent temporal  relationship between creep events and earthquakes on the SAF in  this area from April - November 1995; six successive times,  magnitude 3.4 to 5.0 earthquakes were preceded by creep events in  the region, with the creep events occurring between 1.5 and 5 days  before the earthquakes.  The statistical significance of this  correlation will be evaluated as well as related questions of the  physics of earthquakes in creeping sections of the SAF.  The  findings may be relevant to the Parkfield segment of the SAF and  other creeping fault segments.  This research is a component of the  National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***",
