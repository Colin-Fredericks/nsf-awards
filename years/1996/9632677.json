 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632677  Williams    Computational researchers in the states of Alabama, Kentucky,  Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia (a.k.a.  the 6-PAC) have formed the South East Partnership to Share  Computational Resources (SEPSCoR).  The supercomputers located in  each of these states will be linked by high speed wide-area  networks to form a more powerful \"virtual supercomputer\", which  will be focused on the solution of highly intractable computational  problems, such as the modeling and molecular dynamics of complex  materials. This shared resource will be available to all  researchers who are approved by the consortium. The high-speed  networks which will make this possible will be managed by a  partnership with the Southeastern Universities Research Association  (SURA) and the networking Corporation, Bolt, Beranek and Newman  (BBN). This award will fund the start-up costs of this networking  partnership in its first year, after which, a full maintenance  proposal will be submitted to the Division of Networking and  Communications Research and Infrastructure. The net result of this  project will be the demonstration of how computational science can  be advanced through the utilization of an advanced networking  infrastructure. The initial projects using this interstate facility  will be in the area of computational materials research, but in the  long term, other numerically-intensive areas will benefit as well.",
