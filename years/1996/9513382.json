 "awd_abstract_narration": "MCB-9513382  May  The identification of conditional mutations that disrupt mitosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Aspergillus nidulans has allowed the scientific community  to begin to understand the events of this fundamental genetic process at a molecular level. Conditional mutations in the A. nidulans gene bimD lead to an aberrant mitotic spindle with one-third the normal number of microtubules. Strains carrying such bimD mutations undergo an abortive mitosis during which the chromosomes fail to attach to the remaining spindle microtubules and do not migrate to the poles. In addition, at permissive temperature, mutations in bimD confer sensitivity to DNA damaging agents: following mutagen treatment, bimD mutants enter mitosis and die. The investigator has cloned and sequenced bimD, which encodes a novel polypeptide with a predicted structure suggesting  a DNA-binding protein with properties of the bzip class of transcription factors.  Attempting to identify other molecular components of the chromosome segregation process, the investigator also has discovered several mutations that suppress the heat-sensitive mitotic defect of the bimD6 mutation. He has cloned and sequenced one of these extragenic suppressor genes and determined that its gene product is a member of the widely distributed family of DA-box proteins. Members of this family include the yeast SMCl and SMC2 gene products, the S. pombe cut3+ and cutl4+ gene products, the Caenorhabditis elegans dpy-27 gene product, and the Xenopus laevis XCAP-C and XCAP-E chromosomal proteins. These products have roles in such processes as chromosome segregation, gene dosage compensation, and X chromosome-specific repression of transcription.  Thus the investigator's identification of the suppressor gene as a DA-box protein gene supports his hypothesis that these genes function in chromosome segregation.  The initial focus of the current study will be the identification of the other genes whose products participate in this  pathway by cloning the remaining extragenic suppressors of bimD6. Understanding how these products function  will lead to new insights into mitosis at a molecular level.  %%%  Mitosis is the process by which eukaryotic cells equally divide their genetic information following its replication. Mitosis must occur in a precise and orderly manner for the survival of the cell and/or organism. While the major events of mitosis have been known for a long time, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying many of them remain a mystery.  Through the  analysis of (1) fungal strains in which the process is disrupted by mutation and (2) strains (derived from one of the original disrupted strains) which carry compensating mutations, the principal investigator will broaden our understanding of the molecular details of this fundamental process.  ***",
