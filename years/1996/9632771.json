 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this grant supported under the GOALI initiative in the Experimental   Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry division, A. Welford   Castleman at Pennsylvania State University, in conjunction with David   Thorn of DuPont Central Research and Development, will study the   structure and kinetics of clusters of transition metal oxides (Ti, Zr,   Nb) in fast flow reactors using tandem mass spectrometers.  The   effectiveness of these compounds as catalysts will be determined by   examining their effect on several novel gas-phase reactions, such as the   transfer of oxygen atoms to acetone to form methyl acetate.    A catalyst is a material which modifies a chemical reaction, such as   increasing its rate or causing different end products to be produced,   while leaving the material itself chemically unaltered at the end.  The   impetus behind this joint academic-industrial research project is to   determine the potential of various transition metal oxide compounds as   selective catalysts for chemical reactions involving the C-C and C-H   bonds in various hydrocarbon compounds.  DuPont scientists with   experience in solid state chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis will be   able to synthesize materials which were identified in Pennsylvania   State's gas-phase experiments as being particularly active in catalyzing   these reactions.",
