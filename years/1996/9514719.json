 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award allows the principal investigator to engage in several research projects in ethics and values in science while expanding his knowledge of ethics.  He will work on two projects, with five ethicists, three at his home institution and two in the Chicago area.  These ethics scholars represent different perspectives and areas of competence (e.g., professional ethics, ethics in science, ethics of compromise, etc.),  The first project will develop a book that will integrate ethical considerations with actor-network perspectives, in examining domestic and international approaches to scientific and technical development and modernization.  The second involves adding ethical considerations to strategies used by agricultural cooperatives in grappling with the new biotechnologies.  The project will raise issues surrounding the impact of these technologies and the organizational changes they portend, on ethical and other values held by cooperative members.  The ethical issues will be added to the agenda at a meeting of cooperative leaders to be sponsored by USDA.  For both projects, the mentors will suggest relevant readings and discuss the issues with the investigator, who will pose specific questions to them.  In addition, the investigator will audit a graduate seminar in ethics at his home institution and participate in seminars at the Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions at IIT.  Outcomes will include a book on ethics and development, journal articles on ethical issues for cooperatives, presentations at scientific meetings, and integration of ethics into the investigator's teaching.",
