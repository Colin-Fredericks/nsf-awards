 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will research and develop advanced in situ, gas sensors that are simultaneously extremely sensitive (parts-per-billion-volume (ppbv) or lower concentrations), and low in cost. These laser-based sensors are designed to meet the increasing demands for improved chemical characterization and monitoring instrumentation of gaseous species (molecules/ atoms/radicals/ions) in chemical and environmental science applications. The unique properties of semiconductor diode lasers coupled with the high detection sensitivity and operational versatility of a new spectroscopic technique, intracavity laser spectroscopy (ILS), provide the technology innovation required to successfully address these applications.   In comparison to currently available ILS gas sensors based on crystal lasers, the new generation of semiconductor diode laser/ILS sensors will have (i) substantially lower costs, (ii) simplified operational parameters, and (iii) expanded applicability while maintaining high detection sensitivity relative to any currently available gas sensors. During Phase I, this firm will utilize its established expertise in ILS technology to determine the specifications required for  semiconductor diode laser/lLS gas sensors which are optimized for characterization of chemically and environmentally important gaseous species under realistic processing conditions.       New opportunities to design extremely sensitive, low-cost gas sensors that are operationally simple have applications in the chemical and environmental sciences. Commercial markets for sensors include the semiconductor industry (e.g., microcontamination monitoring, real time in situ detection of gaseous species, controlling the reactivity in chemical processing), monitoring combustion and plasma reactions used in the preparation of high quality deposited materials (e.g., flat panel display fabrication), the ultra-high purity gas supply industry, and the  fields associated with environmental monitoring and certification of 1egal compliance.",
