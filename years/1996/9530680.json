 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peter Wolynes is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical research in   the area of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.  The proposed work   focuses on new models of energy flow in gas phase molecules, biomolecules   at low temperatures and clusters, as well as the study of reaction   kinetics in biomolecules.  The energy flow work is analytical theory   using techniques borrowed from the theory of quantum transport in   disordered systems combined with a mesoscopic approach that examines how   intramolecular dynamics changes as the size of the molecular system grows   to approach a macroscopic limit.  The biological reaction dynamics is   largely computational and deals with tunneling phenomena in biomolecules,   focusing on ligand recombination in heme proteins.  A third area of study   involves intermittency and microscopic theories of statistics of single   molecule reaction dynamics which will be useful in interpreting recent   experimental studies involving the spectroscopy of single molecules.  The application of statistical methods to study the physical behavior of   systems containing many particles at equilibrium is  well developed, but   similar application to nonequilibrium  systems such as those undergoing   chemical reaction is a major current frontier of physical chemistry.    Professor Wolynes is developing statistical techniques to obtain useful   information about such reacting systems, particularly those undergoing   biological transformations or those interacting with solvents in solution   reactions.",
