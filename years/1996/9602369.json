 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technology Instruction for the 21st Century - Phase II     Rapid advancements in telecommunications--data communications and distributed information systems technology--have significantly increased the scope of knowledge and skill required of science and technology students. Using telecommunications technologies as a vehicle for instructional change, this project integrates four components: Curriculum and Instructional Materials Development, Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement, Faculty Enhancement and Dissemination of instructional materials, and Distance Learning and Remote Access Technology. The anticipated outcomes of this project are: improvement of marketable skills for science and technology students; development of methods to keep curricula in pace with cutting edge technology through development, delivery, and dynamic revision of instructional materials; and promotion of activities that significantly improve faculty skills. Curriculum and Instructional Materials will be developed for courses and laboratories in the telecommunications technologies. Courseware will be in the form of on-line (networked) laboratory manuals, instructional multimedia presentations, and innovative uses of converging technology as instructional tools. Interactive multimedia courseware on high speed networks will serve as textbook and laboratory manual for the twenty-first century. Revisions will be made dynamically keeping all materials current. Products resulting from project activities will also support the NYNEX Next-Step AAS degree program in telecommunications technology and the consortium of SUNY and CUNY colleges developing the program. Because network technology is a core project tool, it is anticipated that the dissemination of project materials will occur via local and wide area networks and that faculty will utilize telecommunications technology to promote ongoing dialogs and exchanges.",
