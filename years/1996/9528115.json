The goal of this  research project is to explore research problems in intelligent  contrml and robotics.  For this purpose, a completely autonomous  flying robot will ultimately be built which can carry out simple  tasks within its environment.  The issues under investigation  include developing a theoretical framework for the interface  between the two levels of controllers, incorporating a learning  algorithm within the task planner to improve its performance as  it becomes more experienced in its environment, and integrating  the sensor data with the different controllers to achieve  automatic obstacle avoidance while insuring that the goal is  reached.  The extra degrees of freedom of a flying robot both  increase its maneuverability and make it more difficult to  control.  In contrast to a terrestrial-based robot, a helicopter  must always be under automatic control.  It can never stop in  place, evaluate its current surroundings, compute a new path, and  then continue its mission.  It is not statically stable, and the  dynamic stabilization problem is known to be hard.  If these  difficulties can be overcome through intelligent control, the  result will be a highly-flexible, extremely maneuverable  autonomous system.",
