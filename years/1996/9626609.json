 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mesterton-Gibbons  9626609       The investigators use evolutionary game theory to study  cooperative behavior among animals.  They work toward a general  theory that categorizes cooperative behavior in nature as  kin-selected behavior, group-selected behavior, byproduct  mutualism, or reciprocal altruism.  In pursuit of this goal, their  investigation focuses on cooperative behaviors that can be  excluded on a priori grounds from the first two categories  mentioned above.  Examples of such behaviors are food sharing in  ravens and defensive behavior in lions.  Accordingly, the  investigators focus on reciprocity versus mutualism and develop a  mathematical model with the power to discriminate between these  two categories of cooperative behavior.  The model is important  because many examples of reciprocity in nature have been  hypothesized, but hardly any have been proven: without such a  model, virtually every example is equally interpretable as a case  of mutualism.       The goal of the study is to determine whether animals can  cooperate in nature because they keep score of favors done to --  and favors received from -- specific individuals, or because  acting in their long-term self-interest coincides with acting in  the best interest of their community, even though they do not  keep score.  From a purely scientific perspective, an answer to  this question will advance current knowledge of animal behavior  considerably.  From a more utilitarian perspective, even though  the study's primary subjects are non-human animals in the wild,  the investigators' findings will be relevant to achieving  cooperation among humans as well.  In particular, the study's  findings may help to solve the urgent problem of the commons,  i.e., the problem of designing cooperative social structures for  sustainable management of the global environment.",
