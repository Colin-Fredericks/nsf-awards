 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526868  Yeung      This award will support the travel costs, over a two year period,  to enable Dr. Pui-kuen Yeung of the Aerospace Engineering  Department at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and for  Catherine Moseley, a graduate student in the Department, to  conduct collaborative research with Dr. Michael S. Borgas from the  Division of Atmospheric Research of the Commonwealth Scientific  and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) located at  Mordialloc, Victoria.  The cooperative research will focus on  simulation and stochastic modeling of contaminant transport and  dispersion in turbulent airflows.    In air pollution problems the mean concentration region arising  from localized pollution sources is primarily determined by a  disorderly motion of fluid elements best described using the  Lagrangian approach of fluid mechanics.  The data, which are  difficult to measure, may be extracted from numerical simulations  of the exact, instantaneous momentum and scaler transport equations  in turbulence.  This research is of particular timeliness in  enhancing the development of stochastic models of turbulent  dispersion in the environment.  The CSIRO laboratory conducts a  large atmospheric research program, and that combined with the  parallel computing facilities available at the Georgia Institute  of Technology, will enable this study to be realized.  Support  in Australia is provided through the Department of Industry,  Science and Tourism (DIST).",
