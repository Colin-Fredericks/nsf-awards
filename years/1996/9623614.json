The Modeling Facility will use state-of-the-art technology to achieve high-bandwidth, low-latency machine-to-machine communications, resulting in significant computational leverage.  The use of multiple heterogeneous and potentially specialized computers in a tightly coupled communication environment permits model builders to explore novel parallel simulation methods that can greatly reduce simulation run times.  This increase in capability permits entirely new classes of critical problems to be solved.  Modern simulations produce large quantities of data, the interpretation of which may not be immediately apparent.  Thus, the second central component of the Modeling Facility is a large capacity storage management system.  Finally, the Modeling Facility will be equipped with several special purpose devices that can exploit the communications and data management facilities to tackle large-scale problems that are currently infeasible in a traditional academic computing environment.",
