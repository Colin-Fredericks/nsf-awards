 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides funding to complete assembly of a working paleomagnetic laboratory, which furnishes students with a practical tool with which to examine fundamental geological problems. The lab provides an example of how real, vital, contemporary paleomagnetic and tectonic studies are done and allows undergraduate students to participate directly in such research. Undergraduate students are now introduced to a number of geophysical instruments and techniques in a freshman-level course. The instruments previously used are mainly for looking at small-scale features and local geologic problems. Paleomagnetism is one of the most important geophysical tools used for examining `big-picture` tectonic processes. The ability to do paleomagnetic analyses fills a need in this area and complements the previous geophysical program perfectly. In addition to use by introductory-level students, the lab can be used by upper-level geology majors as part of a well-supported, faculty-advised undergraduate science research program at the university. The equipment fits into continuing and proposed student research projects involving all faculty in the Geology Department as advisors. This innovative project affords students the unusual opportunity to be involved in a significant way in a young, rapidly developing field of geological research.",
