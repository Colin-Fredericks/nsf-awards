 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop an integrated computer laboratory for general science education at Palomar College.  The project involves design, implementation, and evaluation of an integrative curriculum for three cohorts of students enrolled in the designated general education biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, geography, geology, and oceanography classes. Organized around the theme of oceanography, collaborative research projects and daily assignments are integrating industry-related curricula into introductory science courses and addressing career awareness and student interactions with the professional scientific community. The computer lab is bridging scientific theory with industry applications. The project is facilitating student learning in an open computer lab environment. It also provides a model for a four-part faculty enhancement program. Faculty have the opportunity to develop relationships with scientists and others in industry, integrate curriculum, and develop learning communities. A Teacher's Resource Guide and a train-the-trainer program are ensuring local and national project information dissemination.",
