 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title:  A Partnership for Computer-Based Curriculum Development in Atmospheric Technology               The objective of this project is to develop computer-interactive training modules in Atmospheric Technology, which are designed to significantly involve environmental technology degree curricula at community colleges nationwide. The project addresses each of the three activities described for an ATE Project (a) Curriculum and Instructional Materials Development, (b) Teacher and Faculty Enhancement, and (c) Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement. Project goals are:  (1) Provide training in Atmospheric Technology which adequately prepares students for employment in careers such as air quality monitoring and meteorological data applications; and (2) Develop a summer workshop program to train community college teachers to incorporate the computer-based training modules with field and laboratory instrumentation for environmental technology applications.   The project is a collaborative effort of the Desert Research Institute (DRI), of the University and Community College System of Nevada, the Colorado Mountain College (CMC), and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). The DRI operates a mountaintop research laboratory on a 10,500 ft. peak, within 5 miles of the CMC Alpine Campus, which will serve as a field and classroom location for the development of instructional graphics, video and datasets for the training modules. The laboratory and co-located community college campus will also host the teacher workshops. The partnership between the CMC, DRI and UCAR scientists and faculty includes the design, development, assessment and dissemination of the computer-based training modules. A minority population group, Native Americans, is specifically identified for enhanced outreach activities. In addition, an Advisory Committee with members representing industry, government agency, and environmental education groups will provide guidance on the technology curriculum content and empl oyment targets.",
