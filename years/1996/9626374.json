 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626374  RABALAIS         The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON)will  operate the R/V PELICAN during 1996 as a general oceanographic  vessel in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The PELICAN  is a 105' general research vessel constructed and operated by  LUMCON. The vessel is scheduled for 99 operating days in 1996, of  which 23 days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  The ship  operates primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.         This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science  Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most  oceanographic research projects require highly specialized  equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An  increasing number of research projects require equipment that must  be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be  specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires highly trained  crew members for maintenance and operation.  These vessels do not  operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and  therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels  specifically dedicated to oceanographic research.  These vessels  are operated by universities and research institutions around the  country.",
