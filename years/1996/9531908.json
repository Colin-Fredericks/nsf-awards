One of the   main themes in this project involves the study of  (so called) singular unitary representations using a   technique we call transfer which \"moves\"  unitary representations between real forms of the same   complexification.  To implement this idea one must have   very detailed information on the restriction of   representations to (generally non-compact) symmetric   subgroups.  This analysis is of interest in its own right   and has led (and will lead) researchers (including the PI)   to surprising generalizations of Howe's theory of reductive   dual pairs to exceptional groups.  It will also lead to   confirmation of special cases of some remarkable   conjectures of B.  Gross and D.  Prasad.  Another key   direction of this research involves the continued study   of the module theory of the ring of invariant polynomial   differential operators on a reductive Lie algebra.  This   work has already led to a new interpretation of the   Springer correspondence.  The new direction here will   involve some sort of \"relative Springer correspondence\".   This project also involves joint work with Matthew Clegg on   the development of a symbolic algebra package (to be called   \"Groebner\") designed for large scale computations using   parallel supercomputers or distributed networks of work   stations.          The solution to the problems described in this project  would expand our understanding of some of the most exciting   developments in the interaction of representation theory with   apparently unrelated parts of mathematics and physics.  For   example the detailed analysis of one singular representation   (by Kostant and his coworkers) has led to new solutions to   Einstein's equations.  Representation theory of the type   studied in this  project is also an important ingredient in the   Langland's program of which one very small part due to Wiles   led to his (Wile's) proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.",
