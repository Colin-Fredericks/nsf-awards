 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634718  McMahon    It is proposed to carry out an experimental study of the  mechanisms of diffusion-controlled intergranular brittle  fracture in model iron-and copper-based alloys using  bicrystals with symmetrical tilt boundaries.  Previous  research has been carried out on polycrystalline materials,  and these suffer from limitations that preclude a  quantitative test of the model proposed for this phenomenon,  which we believe is a unique and generic form of brittle  fracture.  The reasons for using bicrystals are the  following:  First, the cracking rate should be proportional  to the grain-boundary diffusivity of the embrittling element  (which is hypothesized to diffuse in from a free surface  under the influence of  an applied stress, as in diffusion  creep).  In a bicrystal the diffusivity can be held constant  in a given direction, and the diffusion direction can be  varied so as to obtain a fixed and measurable ratio of  diffusivities, and therefore crack-growth rates.  Second,  the fractured bicrystal will present a large flat fracture  surface on which high-resolution scanning electron  microscopy and atomic-force microscopy measurements can be  made of the intervals of cracking in what is likely a step-  wise process.  Third, the crack-tip stress field should be  constant along the crack tip and along the crack path, at  least in the central portion of the specimen; it is this  stress field that is postulated to drive the diffusion and  therefore the crack extension by decohesion.  %%%  These research will establish in a fundamental way the  mechanisms of diffusion-controlled intergranular brittle  fracture, which could be a common, but unrecognized form of  failure in engineering materials.  ***",
