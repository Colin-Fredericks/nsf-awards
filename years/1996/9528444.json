 "awd_abstract_narration": "A   domain-independent   knowledge-based   framework   is   being  developed,  specific to the task of abstraction of  higher-level,  interval-based  concepts from time-stamped  data  in  a  context-  sensitive  manner.   The inference structure used  is  knowledge-  based   temporal-abstraction,  which  decomposes  the   temporal-  abstraction  task into five subtasks, each solved by a  temporal-  abstraction  mechanism.   The research provides a  formal  method  for  specification  of  temporal-abstraction  knowledge  and  for  facilitating its acquisition, maintenance, reuse, and sharing.  A  representation  of  the  knowledge in  the  web-based  Ontolingua  language  also is evaluated.  The temporal-abstraction mechanisms  are  being  extended and validated within the RESUME system.   An  automated   graphical  tool  for  acquiring  temporal-abstraction  knowledge   is  developed  using  the  PROTEGE-II   system.    An  evaluation is being performed of the knowledge-acquisition  tool,  the  computational mechanisms, and the overall framework  in  the  diabetes-therapy  domain  and within  the  EON  architecture  for  guideline-based   care.   The  research  has   implications   for  construction  of knowledge-based planning and monitoring  systems  in time-oriented domains, for automated summarization of temporal  databases,  for the  operational semantics of deductive  temporal  databases,   and  for  the  semantics  of  queries  to   temporal  databases;  preliminary  evaluation in clinical  and  engineering  domains is highly encouraging.",
