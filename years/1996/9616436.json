ITMSs combine the power of visualization and animation with the student modeling capabilities of intelligent tutors to produce interactive learning environments that are highly effective for conveying complex, dynamic processes.    The Center plan will incorporate studies of many existing ITMSs, including a number of systems developed at the University of Massachusetts.  This particular corpus of work, combined with new systems that the University has pledged to develop, provides both an accumulated body of experience in IMTS development and an opportunity to submit many of them to the kind of laboratory analysis that will offer new educational insights into their effectiveness.",
