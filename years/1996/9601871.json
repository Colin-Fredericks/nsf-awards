PROJECT SUMMARY    We  propose  to  establish  a  stable  isotope  facility  at  UC  Davis  containing   two  isotope-ratio  mass  spectrometers,   two   elemental  analyzers,  and  associated equipment for sample preparation  and  data  analysis.  One  of  the mass spectrometers would be a high  throughput,  medium resolution instrument that would be dedicated to the analysis of  enriched  samples;  the other would be a lower throughput,  but  higher  resolution  instrument,  dedicated to  the  analysis  of  variation  in  natural abundance levels. This facility would expedite experiments that  require  stable isotopes including (a) field studies of  soil  nutrient  and water movement, (b) determination of carbon fixation pathway, plant  water use efficiency, and nitrogen utilization, and (c) measurements of  metabolism and nutrient uptake. At present, our analyses are  conducted  off-campus  at  many different locations. Not only has uniformity  been  difficult to insure, but the high expense has limited such analyses  to  research  with  extramural  support.  Worse,  long  turnaround  times--  sometimes  extending to nearly a year--have seriously  compromised  our  experimental  protocols. The proposed stable  isotope  facility  at  UC  Davis should alleviate these problems.      Students, faculty, and staff in the plant and environmental  sciences  at  UC Davis would have access to the proposed facility. The seven  PIs  are  associated  with nine graduate programs. During the  last  decade,  1134  students  have  received graduate degrees  from  these  UC  Davis  programs,   and  364  graduate  students  are  currently  enrolled.   A  significant  percentage  of  these  students  would  benefit  from  the  proposed  facility,  either  through  course  work  or  through   their  independent  research  programs. With a facility  on  campus,  students  could prepare their own samples for analysis to reduce costs as well as  to  provide  direct  experience  using  these  techniques.  Thus,   more  students  would  be  likely to incorporate stable isotopes  into  their  protocols.",
