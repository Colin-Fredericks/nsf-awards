Replacing bronze-processed wire by internal tin wire, high field NMR system cost will be reduced significantly.  The Phase I research objective is to solve engineering problems related to construction of high field NMR magnets with internal tin wire.  To achieve the objectives, Cryomagnetics, Inc. will develop model coils to experimentally determine the internal tin wire stability in persistent mode operation.  Phase I research will include fabrication of NbTi and Nb3Sn joints, analysis of stress distribution in the coils, optimization of the annealing process, design of quench protection circuits and evaluation of internal tin coil stability in persistent mode.   At the end of Phase I, an engineering design of a full scale 600 MHz wide bore NMR magnet will be completed, and this design will be the starting point for Phase II research which will be directed toward development of a full scale NMR magnet with internal tin wire.  The anticipated results from Phase I are to demonstrate the stability of internal tin wire in persistent mode operation and apply internal tin wire to high field NMR magnets.       The new technologies developed in Phase I will generate great commercial opportunities by reducing NMR system costs.  The proposed wide bore NMR magnet systems will be ideal for micro imaging and in vivo spectroscopy as well as biological solid state NMR spectroscopy.  The successful completion of Phase I & II of this project will make low price, wide bore, high field NMR magnets available in the market.  ***",
