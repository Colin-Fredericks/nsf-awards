When viewing a scene, the visual system solves, in an instant,  the problems of recognizing objects, deciding what they are made  of, and where they are relative to each other and the viewer.   The seeming effortlessness of this achievement is all the more  remarkable because the image input to the eye is locally  ambiguous, i.e., in any patch of an image, there is rarely an  unequivocal cue to how far away it is, what it is made of, or how  it is illuminated.  Somehow, the brain makes its best bet as to  what is out there from this ambiguous image, and these decisions  are rarely wrong.  In addition, the image of an object is highly  variable depending on illumination and viewpoint.  For example,  illuminating an object from the left or right has relatively  little effect on our perception of the object, despite the fact  that the object's two images are quite different.  This research  stems from the hypothesis that vision solves the problem of  ambiguity by exploiting the constraints on how images are formed  and on the a priori statistical regularities inherent in object  and scene structure.  From this point of view, vision is a  process of statistical inference that makes good bets based on  available information and solves the problem of variability, in  part, by constraints that are determined by the task itself, such  as determining where, rather than what, an object is.      This research will investigate human perception of the spatial  layout of objects and object properties.  Vision determines  spatial layout from well over a dozen sources of depth  information, including cast shadows.  It is well-known to artists  that the closer the image of an object's shadow is to the object  itself, the closer the object is to the surface receiving the  shadow.  How visual perception makes this inference is not clear,  because local image informatio n does not uniquely specify whether  a local brightness change is a shadow or not.  This research will  identify constraints in the image and scene that resolve the  ambiguities in the perception of depth from shadows.  As for the  perception of spatial layout, determining object properties and  identity is also confounded by local ambiguity as well as by  variability in illumination.   Experiments comparing the  performance of human and statistically optimal observers for  inferences about object shape, material and identity will tease  apart the relative roles of prior knowledge and image cues in  removing uncertainty about the properties of objects.    Visual perception is a major way in which we acquire knowledge of  the world.  Computer scientists have yet to produce a machine  that can recognize objects in natural images.   Understanding how  human vision resolves ambiguity about object location and  identity promises to guide the development of artificial vision  systems and help to unravel the mysteries of the brain itself.  ***",
