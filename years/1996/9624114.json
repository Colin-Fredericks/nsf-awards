 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, aims to focus on  the synthesis and characterization of stable thin films that will  be suspended across microfabricated structures.  During the  tenure of this four-year continuing grant, Professor Fritsch-  Faules and her students at the University of Arkansas will test  these structures for application in novel devices for sensing and  for biomimetric applications.  Submicron structures will be  constructed to support suspended films such as artificial  biomembranes.  The inorganic substrates will be both insulators  and conductors depending upon the particular function they are  intended to serve in these structures.  Studies of these surface-  confined materials will probe their stability and function with  variables including electric field strength, solvent character  and ionic composition of these systems.  Professor Fritsch-Faules  will include a host of activities that are designed to involve  students in the K-12 grades.  Educating these students in the  high-order thinking abilities and problem-solving skills that are  part of science and mathematics will be emphasized.  Community  Access Television and the World Wide Web will be used to  disseminate such programs to diverse audiences.  The ability to construct new three-dimensional microfabricated  structures with wells having geometries for supporting suspended  thin films will be an important outcome of this CAREER research  project.  The characterization of these suspended thin films will  be a challenging scientific and engineering problem that depends  on Professor Fritsch-Faules' unique background in  electroanalytical chemistry and in microfabrication science.  Her  integrated educational plan is no less ambitious and it has the  potential for immense societal impact upon the K-12 students in  her immediate geographic area in the near-term and upon a much  more broadly distributed cohort in the long-term.",
