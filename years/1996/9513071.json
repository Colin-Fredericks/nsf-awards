In order  to achieve this goal the first objective is to develop a  series of procedures for building models that accurately  describe the time evolution of these systems.  The models  are global discrete mappings and ordinary differential  equations constructed only from experimental time series  data.  The second major objective is to exploit  synchronization between the fitted models and measured time  series as a means of carrying out model verification and  control.  The third objective is to explore the use of  topological procedures to constrain and fine tune these  models.  The proposed research will significantly enhance  the ability to detect, model, and control the dynamics of  chaotic systems using observed time series data.  This  project is a collaborative effort involving the close  interaction of several research groups in nonlinear science  (UCSD, GIT).  ***",
