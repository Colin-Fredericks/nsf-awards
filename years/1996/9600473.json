Efforts will involve measurements of the scattered ion energy spectra, neutral fractions, and angular distributions, along with measurements of the associated electron emissions during low energy particle scattering and sputtering.  The researchers will consider these excitations in metals, semiconductors and insulators and draw upon theoretical analyses including molecular dynamics with the use of clusters and pseudopotentials, as well as complete quantum mechanical models.  Results have potential bearing in modern particle-beam technologies.    The project in material research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.   ??",
