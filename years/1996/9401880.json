 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Ranade  9401880     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will investigate the gas phase synthesis of alumina powder in turbulent jet aerosol reactors. During Phase I, it was demonstrated that particles in the size range of 40-100 nm could be produced at outputs of 2 gm/hour. During Phase II, the goal will be to modify the reactor setup and operating conditions to obtain particles in the 10-40 nm size range at outputs of up to 200 gm/hour. The computer model developed during Phase I will be extended to include particle and turbulent flow dynamics. Infrared measurements will be made to obtain the global kinetic rates for aluminum chloride reaction with oxygen. While the focus will be on alumina synthesis, during Phase II an effort will be made to demonstrate the versatility of this technique for other oxide and non-oxide materials such as zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, silicon nitride and multicomponents.   High purity and doped oxides and non-oxide materials in the nanometer size range find extensive application in high temperature ceramics, catalysis and photonics/electronics. Nanosized alumina, specifically, will have potential commercial applications as a high surface area stable catalyst support, super tough envelope for advanced lamps, and as a crack resistant structural material.  ***",
