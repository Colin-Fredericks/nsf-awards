 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry  (GOALI) project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, will enable two workshops designed to bring  together industrial and academic analytical scientists for the  purpose of increased interaction and intellectual exchange.   Under the aegis of this three-year standard grant, Professor Gary  Blanchard of Michigan State University, Dr. Bruce Chase of the  DuPont Company, and Dr. David Rothman of the Dow Chemical Company  will organize these workshops that will be held in off-years  relative to the Gordon Research Conference on Analytical  Chemistry.  These activities will bring together young analytical  scientists from academe and industry with the objective of  enhancing understanding and communication between these two  groups so that training of analytical scientists and their  subsequent contributions to the field will be strengthened.   There is a clear need for better communication between `those  that teach and those that do` analytical science in academic and  industrial settings.  Two workshops will be held that are  designed to provide opportunities for young analytical scientists  from academe and industry to interact and explore areas of mutual  and complementary interests in research and education.  These  workshops are expected to give rise to a network of analytical  scientists across these two communities that facilitates the  mutually beneficial exchange of ideas and information as the  science and technology of analytical chemistry evolves.",
