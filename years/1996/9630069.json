 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study of captive juvenile rhesus macaques will fill in several gaps in our  knowledge of primate social development.  One of the most significant influences on an  individual's development is its gender.  This research project will provide important data which should aid in the construction of general  principles regarding the range and robusticity of gender differences in primate behavior. Of  particular interest to this study is how a primate's gender affects the partner preferences and  quality of social relationships juvenile rhesus macaques form.  Although strong gender  differences in social bonds and interactions are apparent among adult rhesus macaques, it is  unknown whether juveniles exhibit these same differences, or when these behavioral patterns  arise. Consequently, a major goal of this study is not only to document gender differences in  behavior which occur among juveniles of this species, but also to describe when the differences  observed among adults originate. Furthermore, the proposed study will test a previously untested  assumption that behavioral development represents a continuous, linear process. Recent research  suggests, however, that this model of behavioral development may not be universal among  primate species, especially where gender differences in behavior are concerned.  The proposed  study will provide data which will aid in the development of a more accurate model of primate  behavioral ontogeny.",
