 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631907  Ellington    Living  cells,  in  effect, behave  as  internal  combustion  engines.  Various  fuels such as fats and carbohydrates  are  metabolically combusted yielding water, carbon dioxide and a  form  of chemical energy currency known as ATP. ATP provides  the  energy for most useful processes in the cell  including  biosynthesis, pumping of materials across membranes and cell  movement.  Muscle and nerve cells display high and  variable  rates of ATP utilization  which often exceed the capacity for metabolic ATP synthesis.  In  vertebrates, these cells stockpile a chemical  known  as  creatine  phosphate  which acts as  a  reservoir  of  energy  during  periods  of intense energy use.  Creatine  phosphate  belongs to a family of energy storage compounds collectively  known  as phosphagens.  A variety of other phosphagens (ca.,  arginine phosphate, taurocyamine phosphate) are found in the  non-vertebrate animal groups. These compounds function in  a  manner  analogous  to  that of creatine phosphate.  However,  certain fundamental functional differences are evident.  The  present research project will further investigate functional  differences in the diverse phosphagen compounds  using  high  field  nuclear  magnetic  resonance (NMR)  spectroscopy  and  conventional  biochemical methods.  Once  these  differences  have  been delineated, mathematical models will be developed  to  evaluate the functioning of these compounds  in  various  kinds  of  biological contexts (different cell  types,  cell  ultrastructure,  rates of ATP utilization).   The  resulting  simulations  will  be  used  to  evaluate  and  subsequently  explain  the  distribution  of  particular  phosphagens   in  various  animal groups.  These studies will provide  insight  into  the evolution of cellular energy metabolism, a process  vital to the functioning of all cells.",
