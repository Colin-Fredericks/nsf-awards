 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from the University of Connecticut.  The research will test the hypothesis that the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) for adolescent females in Tanzania, Africa, is a function of power differences in their relationships with men.  In Tanzania the second highest number of AIDS cases occurs among women ages 20-24, indicating infection during adolescence. The theory of resource differentials predicts that women's likelihood of being abused by their partners is a function of the women's inability to access resources.  The project will test this theory by assessing the power differentials of adolescent females.  Both qualitative and quantitative  methods will be used in structured interviews, sorting tasks to assess knowledge, and focus groups.   This research is important because STDs are significant among adolescents and advances in our understanding of adolescent sexuality will be important for planners and policy makers designing programs to limit the spread of STDs.  The data from this project will also be valuable for cross-cultural studies of adolescent sexual behavior.",
