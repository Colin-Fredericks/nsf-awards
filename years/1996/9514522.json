Human perception of objects in motion suggests  that the human visual system somehow unifies the responses of  these many neurons into a single perceptual whole, using a  process known as pooling.  This process is spatiotemporal in  nature, because it extends across neurons responding, as moving  objects are observed, to different properties of the object and  to different regions of visual space, as well as across responses  that occur in the recent past as well as in the present.     This research is concerned with spatiotemporal pooling by the  human visual system and is motivated by a three-stage,  quantitative model of motion perception.  The stages of the model  are Detection, Integration, and Decision.  The first two stages  simulate the acquisition and collation of motion information from  low-level motion sensors analogous to those thought to exist in  humans.  The Decision stage simulates a neural network designed  to compute an appropriate velocity from the pooled responses of  the low-level motion sensors.  The model is designed to resolve  not only the motion of single objects moving against a  background, but also to resolve two overlapping transparent  objects moving at different velocities relative to one another.    This research will involve four series of psychophysical  experiments on human subjects.  The research will flesh out  various functional aspects of the pooling process in humans and  of the computer simulation of these processes.  The first series  will determine the spatiotemporal ranges over which pooling  occurs and will determine whether motion pooling is \"hard-wired\"  or whether the visual system has the capacity to adjust its  pooling parameters flexibly when additio nal image information is  present in the visual scene.  The second series of experiments  will determine how motion information from many different  potential sources, e.g., spatial frequency, orientation, color,  disparity, is pooled and represented in velocity space.  The  third and fourth series of experiments will determine how finely  or coarsely image velocity information is represented in velocity  space and will determine the robustness of object velocity  resolution in the presence of noise.    This research will enhance our current understanding of the  processes underlying motion perception in humans.  The research  may be of ultimate utility in robotics, in the design and  construction of visual prosthetics, and in the clinical  assessment of visual dysfunction.     ***",
