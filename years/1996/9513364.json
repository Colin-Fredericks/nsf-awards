 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Eric Hellstrom and a junior colleague and graduate student of the University of Wisconsin to collaborate in materials research with Dr. P Majewski and his group at the Institute for Non-Metallic Inorganic Materials of the University of Stuttgart.  The objective of their research is to increase the flux pinning in bismuth-based high temperature superconductors.  Their approach will be to create flux pinning centers in silver sheathed bismuth-based tape by manipulating the chemistry of the bismuth-based superconductor and varying the thermal processing.  The collaboration brings together the expertise of the U.S. group in the scientific issues involved in fabricating, processing and characterizing long lengths of silver-sheathed high temperature superconductors, with the detailed knowledge of phase relations in the bismuth-based system generated at the University of Stuttgart.   Increased flux pinning will raise the current density that these superconductors can carry at thirty degrees Kelvin to a level that will greatly expand the applications in which they can be used.  The complementary expertise of the U.S. and German groups creates a uniquely qualified collaboration to pursue this valuable objective.",
