 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is  a  request for funds for the purchase  of  an  automated  nutrient  analysis system. This would be a multi-user  instrument,  and  would be housed in a shared-use analytical and instrumentation facility  at  UCSB's  Marine  Science Institute (MSI).  The  new  analyzer  would  replace  a  ten-year-old  system that no longer  has  the  capabilities  required to support current and proposed research projects.              Knowledge  of the concentrations of dissolved inorganic  nutrients  in  aquatic  systems is of fundamental importance to a  wide  range  of  biological  studies. Areas of interest to researchers at MSI  encompass  both fresh and salt water systems, and have included such diverse areas  as  hydrological  and ecological studies of Amazonian  lake  and  river  systems, nutrient dynamics in areas of merging water masses and coastal  upwelling,  biogeochemical  processes  in  California's  Sierra  Nevada  watershed,  water  quality  and nutrient  cycling  studies  in  coastal  estuaries,  and ecological studies in both northern and southern  polar  regions.  A11  of  these studies have required the  analysis  of  large  numbers  of  water  samples for up to five nutrient  species.  Nutrient  analyses  have been done using an analyzer system that is now  over  10  years  old, and which suffers from various problems, including unstable  detectors, relatively poor detection limits, and general obsolescence.              Some  of  the  aforementioned  projects  are  ongoing,  while  new  projects  requiring  nutrient analyses are  starting  up  and/or  being  proposed almost continuously. A feature they all have in common is  the  need  for better and faster nutrient analysis. In the nutrient  cycling  studies  of  coastal marshes and estuaries, for example,  a  system  is  required that can automaticallv handle the wide range of concentrations  (1  to  1000  uM)  and  salinities (O to 34  ppt)  that  are  routinely  encountered  (error-prone  manual dilutions  and  salini ty  adjustments  having been necessary in the past). In the programs dealing with  polar  systems,  sample  size  (for  logistical  reasons)  and  analysis  time  (because of sample stability) are critical. And in a recently initiated  long-term  program  to monitor the chemical, physical,  and  biological  parameters  influencing  sedimentation in a coastal  area  featuring  a  high-resolution sedimentary record, the rapidly changing  oceanographic  conditions require timely nutrient analyses (to provide quick  feedback  to  the  project),  with  both  high sensitivity  (to  detect  depleted  waters),  and high precision (to follow subtle long-term changes).  The  requested analyzer system would fill all of these requirements.              The system we are requesting is the Perstorp Flow Solution III,  a  continuous-flow analyzer with capabilities for both flow injection  and  segmented   flow   technologies.  It  would  be  configured   for   the  simultaneous  analysis  of  up  to five  nutrient  species  (phosphate,  nitrate,   nitrite,  silica,  and  ammonia),  and   would   include   a  random-access   autosarnpler,  peristaltic  pump,   injection   valves,  analysis  cartridges for the , five nutrients, double-beam  photometric  detectors,   and  a  PC-type  computer/controller  with   Windows-based  software.",
