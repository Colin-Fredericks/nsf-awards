The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. John P. Borg to work with Dr. Mike Gaster at  the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.        This research will serve to extend non-obtrusive near wake  control techniques over circular cylinders at or near  critical Reynolds numbers (65<Re<1200).  In so doing, this  research will advance the fundamental understanding of  transition, including location, causality and mechanisms.  This research hopes to locate and identify the origin of a  secondary vortex system, believed to be Tollmien-Schlichting  waves, and the corresponding critical points, which are  believed to form in the near wake and result in roll-up of  the primary vortex.  Pneumatic control ports in the shear  layer and spanwise acoustic excitation are proposed to  hinder the growth of the secondary system and extend  critical Reynolds beyond current limits.  In addition, a  dynamical system is proposed to describe the interaction of  both the primary and secodary vortex system.  Such a system  is to be used to develop an analytical model of transitional  and turbulence.    ***",
