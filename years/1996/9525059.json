 "awd_abstract_narration": "9525059  Waite      This is an award to support research, the objective of which is to  determine the parameters for design of electron beam radiation  processes to treat wastewater and intermediate products of treatment  system components.  Specific examples of research to be investigated  include use of ionizing radiation of the electron beam for  modification of process residuals to improve their biodegradability  when subjected to aerobic and anaerobic digestion, processing of  anaerobic digester supernatant fluids to improve their  biodegradability and to reduce their disruptive effect when recycled  to the treatment system for additional exposure to biotreatment  processes, improvement of sludge dewaterability by modification of  their fluid properties and acceleration of biostabilization processes  such as composting and soil injection.  The project involves an  initial workshop to be conducted in January of 1997 conducted in  cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency for guidance  in conduct of the pilot and engineering-scale research.      Electron beam radiation has been found to be effective in disinfection  of sludges produced during treatment of domestic wastewater.  The  ionizing radiation of a beam of energized electrons has been shown to  be effective in destruction of organic compounds of pollutional  significance.  Indications are that electron beam radiation could be  utilized productively within existing wastewater treatment plants to  improve the efficiency of other treatment system components.  This  project will utilize an existing 1.5 MeV electron beam accelerator  located at the Miami-Dade Wastewater Treatment Plant on Virginia Key  to obtain engineering-design parameters.  This engineering-scale  operation will be guided by results from pilot-scale research using a  4 MeV linear accelerator being installed at the University of Miami's  Laboratory for Pollution Control Technologies. ***",
