 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the establishment of a digital imaging instructional laboratory. Surveys conducted on the printing industry suggest that the use of digital imaging will increase dramatically in the next few years. At the recent Graph Expo printing equipment and supply show held in Chicago, most of the major manufacturers of printing equipment were demonstrating some form of computer to film, computer to plate, or computer to press system. These systems replace most of the labor-intensive film preparation work with the preparation of digital images. Now, the computer operator can be the designer, typesetter, scanner operator, film assembler, color separator, and platemaker, all in one computer system. This means that the computer operator must become familiar with a broad range of printing knowledge as it applies to digital images.   Through this project, students can experiment with scanning images, manipulate images with digital special effect, and test output image quality based on varied input resolutions. Traditional printing course content is still valid but must be reframed in a computer environment. New lessons and supporting instructional materials are being created for this model laboratory setting.   It is important to the university that students learn the methods and outcomes of inquiry in the sciences and professions guided by faculty. The School of Technology's mission is to provide state-of-the-art experiences and to maintain model laboratories related to its instructional areas. Updating the digital imaging equipment in the Graphic Communications laboratory helps the school and the university meet their goals.",
