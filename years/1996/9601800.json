Continuing and new research activities  supported by this acquisition include fundamental studies of  pulsed laser processing of ceramics and metal-semiconductor  couples; pulsed laser deposition and bonding of bioceramics to  metal alloys; photothermal and photochemical mechanisms for laser  activation and encapsulation; and synthesis of super-hard  materials using energetic laser ablation. The combination of the  laser and processing/deposition chamber will enhance presently  aging and outdated capabilities by permitting depositions to be  carried out quickly; by making possible combinations of film  depositions and in-situ laser processing that are currently  inaccessible; and by facilitating investigations at elevated  substrate temperatures.  %%%  The research instrumentation will be used to support important  materials research in the area of pulsed laser processing of  metals and ceramics; to broaden this research by providing new  experimental capabilities not currently available at the  university; and to facilitate inter-departmental and inter-  laboratory research collaborations within the University of  Tennessee and with Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  ***",
