 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project  will  develop a collection of hands-on  activities  that  support introductory college mathematics at the  Elementary  Algebra,  Intermediate Algebra and Precalculus levels. The  units  will  particularly support older students who are coming back  to  school.  There  will be student and teacher materials  that  help  convey  mathematics  within the context of engaging  applications  and   interesting  problems.  The  materials   will   support   a  cooperative  learning  style, with the  students  doing  hands-on  group   activities  during  much  of  class  time.  The  hands-on  activities   help   students  visualize  mathematics   and   make  connections   between  the  real  world  and   the   mathematics.  Particular  attention  will be paid to developing  materials  for  students in teacher preparation programs, and for the faculty who  work  with  these  preservice teaching majors. Many  mathematical  topics  will  be integrated into each application. The  materials  will  be  supported  by  the use of spreadsheets  and  the  TI-82  calculator.  Hands-on activities using cooperative learning  will  appeal to the learning styles of holistic learners and we believe  that  the  methods encouraged by our materials will engender  the  support  networks  that  social learners often  appreciate.   The  applications   will   come  from  physics,  economics,   biology,  genetics,  and  other  areas  of  interest  to  students.   These  applications  provide  a context for the mathematics.  To  insure  accuracy, practitioners in a variety of fields will be consulted.  Over the two years of funding, units will be developed to support  most  topics  in  Elementary Algebra, Intermediate  Algebra,  and  Precalculus.",
