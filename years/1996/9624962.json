 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624962  Ailion    NMR  (and  NQR)  techniques for the study of  the  ultraslow  diffusion  of  large topological. defects  will  be  further  developed  by the PI and applied to detecting the  diffusion  of   the  modulation  wave  in  structurally  incommensurate  insulating and incommensurate glasses.  These techniques are  based  on  measurements of the magnetization decay over  the  incommensurately  broadened  NMR  lineshape.  In   addition,  rotating-frame relaxation time techniques will be  developed  for measuring the slow motions of quadrupolar nuclei.  These  techniques will be applied to elucidating the nature of such  motions  during the transition from a perfect incommensurate  crystal to an incommensurate glass. The techniques developed  in  this  project should be applicable to motions  of  other  topological defects such as dislocations in deformed solids,  domain  walls in magnets, superconducting flux lines, charge  and  spin  density waves, and layered boundaries in  layered  structures.  %%%  Nuclear   magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  techniques   will   be  developed  further and applied to the study of the ultraslow  motions of large massive defects in solids, which can not be  detected  by  other techniques. However, a novel  technique,  recently developed by the principal investigator, can detect  motions that are several orders of magnitude slower than can  be  observed  by the conventional techniques. In particular,  these methods will be applied to the motions of a particular  defect.  called  the  modulation wave,  which  exists  in  a  special     class    of    disordered    material    (called  incommensurate),  which has properties intermediate  between  that of a perfect crystal and a glass. This research touches  on  the  transition between perfect crystals and  disordered  matter  as  well as on the nature of glasses.   The  insight  gained  may be important in understanding the properties  of  magnets  and superconductors, and the new techniques  should  be  app licable  to motions of other large-scale  defects  in  widely different solid state systems.  ***",
