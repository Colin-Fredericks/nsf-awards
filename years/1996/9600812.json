 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600812  Bullitt     This is Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and Engineers.  The spindle pole body (SPB) is the microtubule organizing center of yeast. Nuclear and cytoplasmic microtubules originate at the SPB, and thus this complex structure plays a significant role in regulation of cell cycle.  The power genetic tools available for yeast, and the reduced number of microtubules in the mitotic spindle (<50, versus thousands in mammalian centrosomes) make the yeast an excellent system for studying the central question of how cells utilize microtubule organizing centers for all aspects of cell division.  Transmission electron microscopy and image processing will be used to determine the three-dimensional structure of the core portion, and to assess any underlying symmetries.  The SPB core is obtained by brief treatment of isolated SPBs with heaprin, which disassembles the microtubules and removes the outer and inner plaques of the SPB, leaving intact the central plaque and attached filamentous structures.  The presence of symmetry will be assessed, and, if applicable, used in three-dimensional tomographic reconstructions from tilt series data.  The research to be conducted during the planning grant period will provide the basis for more detailed structural studies of the yeast spindle pole body.  The objective is an understanding of the relationship between structure and function of microtubule organizing centers.  ***",
