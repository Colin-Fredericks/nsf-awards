 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628245  Carey   The P.I. will model sea water intrusion in southern Baldwin County, Alabama.  This study necessarily requires a region where there are sufficient data for model inputs.  Baldwin County is a rapidly growing region of the Gulf Coast and like many coastal areas, relies primarily on groundwater as its source of potable water.  Because of the importance of groundwater to this region, there has been a wealth of data collected.  Available data include well water levels, water chemistry, pumping rates and surveys of water uses.  Other data available include aquifer parameters like hydraulic conductivity.  A calibrated seawater intrusion model of southern Baldwin county will be used in an inverse manner to determine the flux of fresh water flowing through the system and escaping to the ocean.  The Alabama Gulf Coast is a region typical of the earth's passive continental margins.  Many of the estuarine deposits which were formed during sequential incising and excising of the coast during sea level rise and lowering have been preserved as hard bottom deposits here.  This initially local study will provide insight into much of the world's passive continental margins and the fresh groundwater fluxes onto them.",
