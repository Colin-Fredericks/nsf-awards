The research group  emphasizes the development of a new generation of capabilities  for measuring and modeling mechanical response at the microscopic  level.  Advanced measurement and modeling techniques will be  used.  The goal will be to develop methodologies to realize  predictive capabilities and to understand the performance and  limitation of particular microstructures at micron and atomic  length scales.  The MRSEC supports the development, operation and  maintenance of shared experimental facilities for materials  research.  It provides seed funding for exploratory research and  fosters research participation by undergraduates.  The Center  develops educational modules consisting of interactive  demonstrations and laboratory projects to be used by mathematics  and science teachers.  The MRSEC also supports enhanced  collaboration with industry, shared experimental facilities that  also support research not directly funded by the MRSEC, and seed  funding for exploratory research.  The Center currently  supports  about 12 senior investigators, 2 postdoctoral research  associates, 3 technician or other professional, 12 graduate  students, and 4 undergraduates.  The MRSEC is directed by  Professor Rodney Clifton.  %%%  The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at  the Brown University supports interactive research in one  interdisciplinary group focusing on advanced materials for  structural and electronic applications.
