 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award will support dissertation research on  the effects of rapidly rising  CO2  concentrations on  terrestrial ecosystems by Cathlyn Stylinski at San Diego  State University in cooperation with Dr. Franco Miglietta at  the CNR Institute of Agrometeorology and Environmental  Analysis for Agriculture in Florence, Italy.  The main  objective of the research is to investigate the long-term  effects of elevated CO2 on gas exchange, water relations,  and distribution patterns of evergreen and winter-deciduous  oak species.  The dissertation project will take place in an  enriched mixed oak forest community in Tuscany, Italy, where  a natural CO2 spring has enriched CO2 concentrations for  centuries or longer.   CO2 springs provide an opportunity to  compare effects from naturally enriched communities to those  from previous short-term manipulations using seedlings  and  saplings in controlled environments and to observe changes  over different times scales and spatial scales.  The  research will benefit from the work of the Italian institute  on Italian CO2 springs and from the Principal Investigator's  work on the effects of elevated CO2 and climate change on  Mediterranean-type ecosystems in such areas as California,  South Africa, Australia, Chile, and the Mediterranean Basin.",
