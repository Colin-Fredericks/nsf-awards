 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626578  Canary       Professor Canary will explore a variety of conjectures concerning  hyperbolic 3-manifolds and the deformation theory of Kleinian groups.  Several of these conjectures are motivated by Marden's tameness  conjecture, which predicts that every hyperbolic 3-manifold with  finitely generated fundamental group is topologically tame, i.e.,  homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3-manifold.  Professor  Canary has previously established that topological tameness has strong  consequences for the geometry of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.  He will  also study the relationship between the algebraic limit and the  geometric limit of a sequence of Kleinian groups.  This study is  inspired by Thurston's ending lamination conjecture, which provides a  conjectural classification of all hyperbolic 3-manifolds.       A 3-manifold is a mathematical space such that about any point there  is a neighborhood which can be identified with a ball in 3-dimensional  space.  One can imagine building 3-dimensional manifolds by gluing  together 3-dimensional blocks.  Of course, this gluing would have to  be an abstract gluing in general, not one which could be done in  3-dimensional space.  For example, consider the 3-manifold obtained by  taking the unit cube and gluing the top to the bottom, the front to  the back, and the left side to the right side.  A Riemannian metric is  a way of measuring distances and angles in a 3-manifold.  For  instance, the world we live in is a 3-manifold with a Riemannian  metric.  In the 1970's, Wiliam Thurston conjectured that every  3-manifold can be cut up, in a canonical way, so that each piece has a  Riemannian metric of one of 8 geometric types.  He proved his  conjecture for large classes of three-manifolds.  The 3-manifolds  which admit seven of the eight geometric types of Riemannian metrics  are completely classified and well-understood.  3-manifolds that  admit the eighth type of metric are called hyperbolic and are currently  a subject of intense interest and act ivity in the fields of geometry  and topology.  Professor Canary is investigating the relationship between  the topology and the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  ***",
