 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to provide a class of adaptive  nonparametric procedures similar to Hogg's procedures, but for  more general situations, including (I) testing for ordered  alternatives in the c-sample location problem (c>2), (ii) testing  for ordered alternatives in the c-sample scale problem, (iii)  testing in the c-sample location - scale problem, (iv) testing,  estimation and multiple comparisons in the one-way layout, two-way layout and multi-way layout analysis of variance (ANOVA)  models.  In addition, we will resolve the practical problem of  handling ties.    Based on the theoretical arguments as well as some extensive  Monte Carlo studies, the supremacy of the procedures over (I) the  usual (non-adaptive) procedure of working only with the ranks and  the resulting statistics, such as Wilcoxon, and (ii) the usual  parametric procedure (based on the assumption of normality of the  underlying distribution function) will be established.    This project will broaden the knowledge and explore new  techniques related to the study of the adaptive distribution free  procedures in several problems in the analysis of variance  (univariate as well as multivariate), multiple comparisons,  estimation of contrasts, among others.  It will enhance the  existing techniques and assist the future research projects in  the related fields.",
