 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601893  Robertson   Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) replicates in nuclei of cells which have excited the cell cycle. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen(PCNA), an accessory factor for DNA polymerase gamma, was co-localized with TGMV in infected cells but was absent in comparable, differentiated cells of healthy plants. PCNA is the first example of a host protein associated with geminivirus infections. The specific goals of this work are: 1) To determine if TGMV infection causes the accumulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins 2) To determine if the viral replication protein, AL1, causes an increase in the expression of other host proteins and 3)To determine if TGMV DNA is preferentially replicated or if chromosomal DNA is also replicated.  %%%  The results of this investigation should lead to important insights into the mechanisms and possible linkage of viral pathogenesis and cell cycle regulation in the host plant. New approaches for the control of viral plant diseases may be developed from the enhanced understanding of such interactions.  ***",
