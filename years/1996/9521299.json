 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521299  Bannon        The ability of atmospheric scientists to numerically model the atmosphere is  fundamental for improved understanding of atmospheric processes and for weather  prediction.  Accordingly, it is important to understand the energetics of the  atmosphere and the capabilities of various numerical representations of the  atmosphere to adequately simulate the energetics.        The Principal Investigator will pursue a theoretical/numerical investigation of  a process known as atmospheric adjustment which is defined as the response of a  compressible atmosphere to a prescribed heating.  The study of atmospheric  adjustment deals with the tendency of the atmosphere to return to a state of balance  after the imbalance caused by rapid atmospheric heating such as might be caused by  convective clouds.          The atmospheric energetics due to rapid heating will be examined with an  assessment of the partitioning of energy between acoustic and gravity modes.  Often   atmospheric numerical models are constructed to remove acoustic waves, for they  are not considered meteorologically important.  Recent research by the PI, however,  has shown that this might not be the case.        This research will serve two practical functions.  Since the research will  assess the role of acoustic modes in weather phenomena, a means will be developed  to document the merits of anelastic (non-acoustic) equations relative to fully  compressible equations (those that allow for acoustic waves).  The research also will  provide a benchmark against which various weather numerical models can be tested.  ***",
