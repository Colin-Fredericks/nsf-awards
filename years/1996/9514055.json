By examining female behavior and  morphology, and by using indices of immunocompetence to  analyze male quality, the research will extend knowledge of  universal, a measure of condition or quality which reflects  immune system competence is clearly linked to an  individual s fitness.  Using captive red jungle fowl, the  work builds on previous studies showing that females prefer  to mate with males with large, colorful combs, and that  infection of males with an intestinal parasite hampers the  development of the same characters used by females in  choosing mates.  In addition, highly ornamented individuals,  have fewer circulating lymphocytes, suggesting that such  males pay a price in terms of reduced immune competence by  appearance, and immune response, and will integrate basic  and applied research in behavior and immunology.  The  outcome will be a better understanding of how behavior,  including aggressive behavior and stressful experiences, is  reflected in immune system parameters that are relevant to  the health of all animals.",
