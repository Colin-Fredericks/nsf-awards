 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is to develop course material for  a Junior/Senior level Electrical Engineering course (Digital  Integrated Circuits) which will expose students to all  aspects of integrated circuit design and fabrication, and to  implement the course in a \"simulated industrial  environment.\" The course will be developed based on input  from an  industrial advisory board consisting of engineers  and managers from IC-related companies. The goals of the  proposed  course are to change the standard instructional  environment, consisting of lectures and individual homework,  to one  which will 1) provide practice gathering technical  information from various sources; 2) develop problem solving  skills; 3) emphasize teamwork; and 4) provide numerous  opportunities to refine oral and written communication  skills.  In the proposed course students will participate as  \"employees\" of an integrated circuit design company  working  in small teams in the different divisions of the company  (Design, Test and Fabrication) to solve a common  problem.  \"Project-chips\" will be created by this proposal allowing  students to compare the design, simulation and  actual  measurements of integrated circuits. Students will evaluate  the problems, define potential solutions, form their  own  plan of action, and communicate their ideas with both peers  and superiors in written, oral and electronic form  (e-  mail). The company framework will be created using an  existing local area network (LAN) loaded with the  software  an IC company would use (word processing, presentation,  circuit simulation, circuit layout, and e-mail).  Existing  measurement equipment will be used to test the companies  \"products.\"  An introductory integrated circuit  course that covers basic  IC fabrication and design is present in most every  electrical engineering curriculum in the  country. The  material generated from this project (\"project-chips\" and  all supporting computer files) will be in  standard formats  such that it is pla tform independent, and thereby applicable  to the widest possible audience. The  effectiveness of this  simulated industrial environment and project-centered  approach will be critically evaluated by the  industrial  advisors, faculty, and student participants.",
