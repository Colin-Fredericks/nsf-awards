(GEM). Prior to that,  he served as Executive Director of GEM.  Originally created as an  outgrowth of corporate and university concerns to increase the  number of underrepresented ethnic/racial groups who enter and  complete the engineering master s degree, currently GEM operates  programs and conducts activities that address the  underrepresentation of ethnic minorities in engineering, science,  and mathematics from precollege to doctorate levels. Adams   accomplishments include:       Development of a very successful program that has assisted a    significant number of students in obtaining higher education    degrees in engineering -- developed a program with 69 employers    and 78 universities that supports 600 minority graduate students    annually;        Demonstration of successful students outcomes -- 1400 master s    degree graduates in engineering, 83 of whom obtained doctoral    degrees, an exceptionally number of minorities obtaining the    Ph.D. in engineering;        Program replicability by several other organizations, e.g., the    National Physical Science Consortium;        Program documentation in the form of publications -- 10    monographs on mentoring and related topics;        Demonstrated innovation on mentoring -- has expanded work on    mentoring by establishing the National Institute on Mentoring;    and         Receipt of awards from organizations such as the American    Society for Engineering and the national Action Council for    Minorities in Engineering (NACME) Service Award, among others.",
