 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cadherin adhesion molecules play a central role in the cell-cell interactions that occur during embryogenesis. Regulation of the temporal and special distribution of functional cadherins is required from the earliest cellular interactions between blastomeres and are maintained throughout the life of an organism. The regulated temporal and special morphogenic patterns in embryos may be brought about by controlling either cadherin expression or its function. This proposal is describes experiments that examines one mechanism through which cadherin adhesion molecule function is regulated though interactions with two extracellular matrix molecules present in embryonic tissues. The first ECM molecule is a proteoglycan (250kD PG), and the second, is a cell surface glycosyltransferase (GalNAcPTase). Previous work has suggested that the proteoglycan is a co-ligand for the cell surface GalNAcPTase; thus, it is thought that GalNAcPTase acts as a cell surface receptor for the proteoglycan. It is also known that the interaction of these two molecules initiates a signal cascade culminating in the loss of cadherin function and thus cell adhesion. The interaction of the 250kD PG ligand with the GalNAcPTase may therefore serve as a regulatory switch controlling key events during embryocenesis.    The long term goal of this research is to understand the developmental significance of the 250kD PG/GalNAcPTase interactive pair. This includes: 1. Defining the molecular characteristics of the 250kD PG and the GalNAcPTase and the basis for their interaction. 2. Determining the components of the signaling pathway and how their interaction leads to cadherin inactivation. 3. Characterizing the temporal and spatial localization of the pair throughout development, and determining the physiological and developmental significance of the interactive pair. This work will establish a link between cell-ECM interactions that regulate loss of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesions. Such feedback adhesive mechanis ms have long been postulated but never before describe in molecular terms.",
