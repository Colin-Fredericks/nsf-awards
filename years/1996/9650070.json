 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supplies equipment for a 20-station computerized classroom for teaching economics. The computerized classroom allows for the integration of computer-aided instruction throughout the economics curriculum. The project targets students taking courses for general education, interdisciplinary majors, business, international affairs, environmental science and economics majors.    In recent years, both the pedagogy and practice of economics have increasingly relied on and employed computer applications. Computer simulations and packages for statistical analysis are highly effective for teaching economics. The use of computers increases both student motivation and success. It gives real-world relevance to material taught in class. Students are able to manage computer-simulated firms and economies and see how economic principles affect the outcomes of their decisions. They use computers to conduct their own analysis of data. In addition, the practice of economic analysis in the real world now requires proficiency with computer applications. Students planning careers involving economic analysis and decision-making must learn how to use available software.  Finally, in both the classroom and in the real world, the use of the Internet and World Wide Web is essential for investigation and research.      The goal of the project is to improve learning in economics classes by effectively integrating computer applications in most, if not all economics courses. The project focuses on five objectives:  (1) incorporate computer laboratories into general education courses, (2) introduce Internet-based curriculum into introductory Principles of Economics courses and continue its use at higher levels, (3) implement a \"tools and methods\" introduction to the major course, (4) further integrate up-to-date statistical analysis packages into quantitative economics courses, and (5) enhance interdisciplinary courses using computerized economic applications and simulations.",
