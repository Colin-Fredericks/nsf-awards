 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625852  Nutt    This micro-indentation machine will be used for measurements  of interface properties in composite materials, as well as a  broad range of applications in materials research requiring  measurements of mechanical properties with high spatial  resolution.  The newly developed instrument mounts to an  existing scanning electron microscope (SEM) and capitalizes  on the inherent capabilities of the SEM without compromising  conventional functions.  A unique feature of the instrument  is the capability to perform measurements at high  temperatures (1000oC) with high spatial resolution and load  sensitivity, while directly observing the indentation and  failure.  %%%  The equipment will be used in studies of interfacial  phenomena occurring in composite materials, including  measurements of interface properties and the effects of  fiber coatings, mechanical and thermal history, residual  stress state, and test temperature.  A broad range of  applications are planned that include studies of hardness in  ultra-fine-grained (UFG) metals, interlayer adhesion in  components produced by layered object manufacturing (LOM),  and the behavior of nanostructured materials and membranes.  The capability of performing mechanical tests with high  spatial resolution and load sensitivity at temperatures up  to (1000oC) is unprecedented and will lead to increased  understanding of the behavior of interfaces and fine-grained  structures, as well as localized phenomena occurring at high-  temperature.  ***",
