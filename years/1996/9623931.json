 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State University of New York (SUNY) is a very large public  college/university system which proposes to develop a SUNY alliance  for minority participation.  The four SUNY institutions that offer  engineering programs are taking the lead on the proposed  initiative.  The four institutions are Buffalo, Binghamton, New  Paltz, and Stony Brook.  While these institutions offer the  engineering programs in the SUNY system, the disciplines involved  in the proposed initiative will also include applied science,  mathematics, physical sciences, and biological sciences.    A variety of successful minority programs already exist throughout  the SUNY system.  The proposed SUNY-AMP proposes to provide  alliances among these programs and establish new programs to meet  the specified goals of the proposal.  In particular, it is expected  that the number of minorities receiving bachelor degrees will  increase twofold from 241 underrepresented minority SMET graduates  to 480 by the year 2000.  Likewise, the expected increase in the  master's degrees will be from 27 to 60; in the case of Ph.Ds the  number of degrees will increase from 4 to 24.    Central to this proposal are four stated goals:  (1) Increase the  number of minority students that are accepted into the coalition of  SUNY schools; (2) Help minority students excel rather than merely  avoid failure; (3) Expand research opportunities for minority  students; and (4) Double the number of SMET bachelor degrees  awarded by underrepresented minority students.    In part, the alliance can be seen as a coalition of four different  regional alliances each centered around the four institutions  mentioned above.",
