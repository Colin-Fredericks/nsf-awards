 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eisenberg  9514145    The investigator and his colleagues study the  behavior of open channels in membranes,  combining experiments and mathematical modeling.  The starting place for a theory of open  channels is a theory of electrodiffusion. It has  long been known that a theory should include the  phenomena of shielding or screening, whereby  the ions in the ionic atmosphere in and around  the channel protein help determine the potential  profile of its pore, but mathematical difficulties  were severe, and analysis was usually focused on  the ionic atmosphere at the surface of the  membrane or end of the channel and not the co-  and counter-ions within the channel's pore.  These difficulties have recently been overcome.  The project develops  PNP theory to predict the current through  the channel, given its structure and distribution of  fixed (i.e., permanent) charge. The project uses Poisson's  equation to describe how charge on ions and the  channel protein determines the electric field; and  the Nernst-Planck equations to describe  migration and diffusion of ions in gradients of  potential and concentration.    The study of open channels is an important  component of biotechnology because channels  have great biological importance in their role as  gatekeepers to cells: they are responsible for  signaling in the nervous system; they coordinate  the contraction of the heart, so it can act as a  pump; in general, they are receptors or effectors  for many drugs and natural substances that  control the life of cells. Channels are wonderful  objects to study by high speed computing  because they use such simple physics (diffusion)  to perform important biological function. The  computation of diffusion is much simpler than  the computation of the quantum mechanics  involved in so many enzymatic functions.  Channels are also natural nanotubes and so are of  importance in the emerging area of  nanostructures, materials and manufacturing.  Porin is particularly well suited in this regard  since it  is available in large quantities, it can be  easily modified by the methods of biotechnology,  and its structure is known in atomic detail.",
