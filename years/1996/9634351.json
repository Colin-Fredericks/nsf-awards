This conference will have four technical sessions which  include: 91) Characterization of biotic and abiotic phases, (2)  Corpuscular models of cell populations, (3) metabolic models, and  (4) modeling of complex cellular systems.  The first session will  scope the different variables used to characterize: (a) the  biotic phase with regard to their experimental measurement as  well as their suitability to describe the physiological state of  the cell, and (b) the abiotic phase with regard to their  experimental measurement as well as their suitability to describe  the rate of change of physiological state of cells in the biotic  phase.  The second session will raise issues related to  corpuscular models or statistical population balance models which  account for the segregation of biomass among distinct cells (or  corpuscles).  The third session will involve a class of non-  corpuscular models, i.e. metabolic models, which view biomass as  a structured entity.  These models account for internal  regulation of metabolic pathways.  This session will address  problems in the application of metabolic engineering.  The fourth  session will be devoted to modeling issues connected complex  organisms and supracellular systems.",
