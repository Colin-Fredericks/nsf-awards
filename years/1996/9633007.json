 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF) Program  will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University   of California Berkeley acquire a NMR.  This equipment will enhance   research in a number of areas including the following: (1)  application   of organic synthesis to biologial problems including helix nucleators and   macrocyclic peptidase inhibitors (2) synthesis and exploratory chemistry   of organometallic compounds and the investigations of their reaction   mechanisms (3)  organic synthesis methodology and total synthesis of   natural products including zaragozic acid and dictyoxetane  (4)    molecular recognition and catalysis in biological systems and   applications of these studies to the design and synthesis of new   molecules with novel biological properties, and (5)  exploratory   synthetic, structural and reactivity studies on novel inorganic systems   including transition metal-silicon chemistry and metal-mediated routes to   charge-transporting polymers.     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.    It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology",
