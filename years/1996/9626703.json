 "awd_abstract_narration": "Osher  9626703       Many physical problems involve interfaces where two  different materials contact with each other, or singular sources  or dipoles are present along the interfaces immersed in the same  fluid.  Mathematically, interface problems usually lead to  differential equations whose input data and solutions have  discontinuities or non-smoothness across interfaces.  Many  numerical methods designed for smooth solutions do not work  efficiently for interface problems.  The investigator's colleague  Zhilin Li combines the immersed interface method, a second order  method for solving differential equations involving interfaces,  with the level set approach, an efficient method  for capturing  moving fronts, to develop high order accurate and efficient  numerical methods for interface problems.  The project develops  convergence and stability theory to provide theoretical  justification for the proposed methods.  Several specific  interface problems, including elliptic and parabolic equations  with fixed or moving interfaces, Hele-Shaw flow, and other  applications, are studied in depth.       Many important practical problems lead to differential  equations in regions of 2- or 3-dimensional space that are  geometrically complicated, and that contain interfaces across  which the nature of the solution changes.  These equations can  rarely be solved exactly, and large-scale computation is required  to obtain well-resolved solutions over multi-dimensional regions.  The goal of this work is to develop efficient computational  methods to approximate solutions of such problems.  The approach  is to combine two different methods with complementary strengths.  To test the new method, it is applied to several problems  representative of those with arising in practical applications.",
