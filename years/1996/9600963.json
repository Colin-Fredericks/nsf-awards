 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600963  McLane    The details of how specific molecules imbedded in nerve cell  membranes (molecular receptors) mediate the signaling of  nervous systems are still not fully understood.  One  particular molecule, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  mediates neurotransmission in skeletal muscle, in the  autonomic nervous system, and in many areas of the brain.  It is known that there are many different nicotinic  acetylcholine receptor subtypes in the brain, but their  function remains elusive because subtype-specific probes are  not available.  The goal of the research project funded by  this grant is to isolate artificial, subtype-specific  peptide toxins that can be used to study the function of  different nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes. These  peptides will be selected from random peptide libraries  using phage display technology.  This new technology allows  the simultaneous selection of peptides that are displayed on  the surface of bacteriophage particles, which also contain  the DNA encoding the peptide sequence.  Peptides displayed  on phage will be selected for binding to nicotinic receptor  subtype-specific sequences.  In addition, this grant helps  support a new laboratory course in molecular neurobiology.    The research funded by this grant is expected to provide  important insights into the molecular function of neurons  and to lead to new tools for further research into the  molecular biology of neuronal receptors.  The laboratory  course to be developed under this grant is expected to  provide a novel approach to teaching molecular neurobiology.",
