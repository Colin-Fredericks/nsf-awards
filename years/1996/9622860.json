 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dixon's formulation for simultaneously eliminating several  variables from a system of multivariate polynomial equations will  be investigated. Solving polynomials equations and identifying  conditions on parameters under which the equations have common  solutions are fundamental problems in symbolic computations which  arise almost everywhere. Polynomials are used to model many  phenomena - particularly in robotics, kinematics, computer  vision, solid modeling, graphics, chemical equilibrium and other  engineering, CAD-CAM design, etc.  Dixon's formulation directly  generalizes Bezout-Cayley's formulation of a resultant for  eliminating a single variable. Dixon resultants have not been  extensively investigated apparently because they presumably got  overshadowed by Macaulay's formulation of resultants for  simultaneously eliminating several variables.  Implementations of  Dixon resultants, Macaulay resultants and sparse resultants  have revealed that Dixon resultants are more efficient to  compute in practice.  Dixon resultants will be analyzed with a  particular emphasis on studying the relationship of the size and  structure of the Dixon matrix to the input polynomial system.  ***",
