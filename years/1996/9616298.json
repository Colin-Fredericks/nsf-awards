The  project which adds an international component to domestic research is under the  direction of Danny Edie of  Clemson University and L.M. Manocha of Sardar Patel  University.  The goal of the research is to develop a low-cost carbon fiber for high-  performance materials.  The ongoing NSF supported research at Clemson has shown  that mechanical and thermal properties of low-cost pitch-based carbon fibers can be  greatly improved by producing non-circular fibers.  The ultimate properties of  these  non-circular fibers are influenced by flow conditions during extrusion and the  molecular make-up of  the mesophase precursor.  The collaboration with Professor  Manocha s group will permit  testing and evaluation of  these non-circular fibers in  carbon/polymer and carbon/carbon composites.  This addition to the testing at Clemson  will determine if the enhanced fiber properties translate into improved composite  performance.      Scope:  This collaboration  adds an important dimension to domestic research  through   the inclusion of complimentary Indian expertise in fabrication and characterization of  carbon/carbon composites. The Indian counterpart heads a strong research program in  this area and is recognized internationally for his work with this class of high-  temperature materials.  The U.S. investigator s expertise is in fiber formation and  characterization. The project  provides an opportunity for graduate students at both  universities to gain a unique research  perspective through  participation in an  international team. This joint effort is well balanced technically and should  result in   mutual benefits.           ***",
