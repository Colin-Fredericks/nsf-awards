 "awd_abstract_narration": "(The Problem)  Few opportunities to learn new methods of physics  instruction exist for physics faculty who teach in  technical/community colleges in the northern New England state of  Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont due to limited funds to pay for  travel and registration at national and, in man cases, regional  AAPT meetings often held in the southern New England states.  (The  Objectives)  This proposal seeks funding for two faculty  enhancement workshops to be held during the summers of 1996 and  1997 to provide opportunities for 24 physics instructors from two-  year and four-year colleges and universities in both the northern  and southern New England states to learn ways of presenting physics  instruction via the Internet and the World Wide Web.  (Methods to  accomplish the objectives)  During the workshops, participants will  learn how to create platform-independent physics lessons using the  hypertext markup language of browsers such as Netscape which can be  shared with other instructors from neighboring New England states.   (Collaborations)  They will work with the nationally recognized  leaders in distance education from institutions including the USAF  Academy and Indiana University, Purdue University Indianapolis who  have developed innovative new ways to teach using the World Wide  Web.   (Significance/impact of the project)  The workshop will  offer the unique opportunity for physics faculty to discuss during  a two-week period critical issues in the teaching of college  physics using distance education at the two and four-year level and  to develop a strategic plan to promote stronger partnerships  between two-year and four-year colleges through the sharing of  information and resources.",
