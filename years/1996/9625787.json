 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625787  Wets    The unifying theme of this project is the convergence, in particular the epi-  convergence, of integral functions as they arise in stochastic optimization,   but also in other variational problems:  optimal control problems, the   calculus of variations, mathematical statistics, etc.. The main reason for   concentrating on approximation questions is that although much is known   about the properties of integral functionals and much progress has been   made in the design of efficient and reliable optimization routines for finite   dimensional linear and nonlinear optimization problems, the use of these   routines to solve infinite dimensional problems has been hampered by   serious shortcomings in what we know about the approximation of infinite   dimensional optimization problems, in particular by finite optimization   problems.    Stochastic optimization models provide tools that support decision making   under uncertainty. These are ``decision'' problems whose data is only known   in a statistical sense, i.e., there is uncertainty about the values to assign to   some of the parameters of the problem, and at best one might have some   statistical information about these parameters.  Typical stochastic   optimization problems are: the choice of a flexible manufacturing plan   when the demand is not known with certainty, asset/liability management   problems, policy setting for pollution controls that are affected by   atmospheric conditions, the design of structures (such as bridges,   skyscrapers) that are going to be subjected to (randomly distributed) seismic   shocks, etc.. Mathematically, stochastic optimization problems are very   difficult to solve because one must, in one way or another, take into account   all possible outcomes of these random parameters. That is why the design of   an approximation theory for such problems is essential, and that is what is at   the core of this project.",
