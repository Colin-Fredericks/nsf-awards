 "awd_abstract_narration": "Li  9626128       The investigator studies a variety of new mathematical  models in epidemiology with the following three goals: (1).  To  build more realistic models. (2).  To search new mechanisms that  can generate new epidemiological phenomena. (3).  To stimulate  mathematical development of more effective tools for model  analysis.  Many of the previously studied models are special cases  of the SEIRS type.  On the one hand, a new analytical method  developed by the investigator and his collaborators makes  rigorous mathematical analysis of the SEIRS models with varying  populations feasible and is a main tool in this project.  On the  other, problems of mathematical interest arising from the model  analysis are thoroughly studied in a general mathematical  setting.  Computation also plays a important role, complementing  analytical methods and testing the model using clinical or  experimental data.       The use of mathematical models to describe the spread of an  infectious disease in a human or animal population has a long  history.  If the disease spreads through direct contact of  individuals, a susceptible individual first becomes infected  through contact with an infectious member; he then stays in the  latent period before becoming infectious; after this he recovers  from the infection with temporary immunity and later becomes  susceptible again when the acquired immunity is lost.  Death due  to both natural causes and infection may occur during the cycle.  The population is divided into four subclasses:  susceptibles,  exposed (those in the latent period), infectious, and recovered,  according to the four stages in the above cycle.  An SEIRS model  for the spread of the infection is a system of ordinary  differential equations that describes how the number of  individuals in each class changes with time and how they  interact, based on various assumptions on the way contacts  between individuals are made as well as on various environmental  effects.  Note that every member of the p opulation is in one of  these classes, so if the disease causes death then the population  size varies with time too.  It is expected that research on SEIRS  epidemiological models with varying population size can  significantly advance our understanding of the transmission  dynamics for many diseases and our interpretation of complex  clinical data, foster more accurate predictions on the time  course of the spread of an infection, and lead to more effective  disease prevention and control strategies.  This is especially  significant today, given the alarming global resurgence of many  infectious diseases.",
