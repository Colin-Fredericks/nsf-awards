 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solounias  9628263      The   rich   55  million  year  fossil  record   of   horses  demonstrates  evolution in dietary adaptation through  time,  potentially in response to environmental change.  Tooth  and  skull morphology changed many times and are associated  with  adaptation  to  new  diets.   Using  a  combination  of  new  methods,  this research will test, for the first  time,  the  prevailing theory that the earliest horses were browsers  in  rain   forests  and  then  gradually  evolved  into  savanna  grazers.   Evolution  from  horse  browsers  to  grazers  is  assumed  to be an adaptive response to climatic changes  and  the  associated  changes in the distribution  of  vegetation  types.   During the Miocene (approximately 20 million  years  ago),  North  American  savannas and grasslands  spread  and  replaced rain forests as global climate became cooler, dryer  and more seasonal.  In this study, the diet of fossil horses  will be compared to modern ungulate herbivores by examining:  (1)  the  microscopic scratches made by  vegetation  on  the  surface  of the teeth as viewed with an electron microscope;  (2) restoration of chewing muscles; (3) analysis of size and  shape  of  snouts; and (4) carbon isotopic  composition   in  tooth  enamel (the isotopic signature of savanna grasses  is  different  than  forest  leaves and  the  specific  isotopic  signature  of  the  diet  should be  incorporated  in  tooth  enamel).   The project thus uses four methods to  study  the  same  dietary  questions  and the  detailed  interaction  of  morphologic  change with the environment.  The  results  may  significantly alter the classic story of horse evolution  as  it  is  currently  presented in books and  museum  exhibits.  Furthermore,  they will provide detailed insights  into  the  process  of  evolutionary change in mammals in  response  to  changing climates and vegetation.",
