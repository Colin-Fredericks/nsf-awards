 "awd_abstract_narration": "We recognize systemic science education problems: The  majority of science courses, grades K-16, offer only the  \"products\" of science and sparse teaching of the \"process\"  of doing science.  Due to this emphasis on products,  college introductory science courses often fail to retain  students in science, mathematics, and engineering majors,  and fail in pre-service training for teachers, and minority  populations.  Systematic change is problematic.  The  different  academic standards in different schools,  colleges, and universities prohibit real articulation among  faculty at these  different levels and places, and there are  few real systemic approaches to curriculum that are  empirically derived or driven.  Our objective is to provide  a multi-institutional process of empirically driven  curriculum development that  emphasizes real-world scenarios  in environmental science.  We will develop three research-  rich, inquiry-based  courses and laboratories that will help  students develop abilities to identify environmental  problems, to design and  implement research to study  environmental problems, to develop functional literacy in  the analysis and interpretation  of data, to attain  functional literacy in the application and use of advanced  technologies, and to draft technical reports.   These  courses and laboratories are based on societal environmental  focal points: Nuclear Waste Storage, Coal Power  Plants, and  Solid Waste Landfills.  Our consortium of five institutions  will form an Interdisciplinary Faculty Institute  to review  and implement the simulations.  The Institute would create  an across-institution infrastructure of  professional  development and collaboration through curriculum seminars  and practical workshops for faculty.  Our  use of an outside  review panel of industry and government content experts  grounds these courses in the real world  processes, and the  model we will develop and quantify will be used at other  institutions, especially those with  populations o f native  Americans and hispanic-Americans.",
