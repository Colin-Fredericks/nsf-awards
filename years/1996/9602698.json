 "awd_abstract_narration": "Howard University, the only Historically Black College and University classified as a Group I Research Institution, is the recipient of ARI funds to renovate research and training space in Thirkield Hall.  Constructed in 1909, the building has the distinction of being one of the oldest structures on campus, and is home to the Department of Physics and Astronomy.  Faculty members are actively involved in ongoing research initiatives that emphasizes atmospheric science, computational physics, condensed matter physics, magnetism, optical physics, remote sensing, spectroscopy, and theoretical physics.  However, existing conditions such as the lack of temperature and humidity controls, severely limit the ability of faculty and students to conduct competitive research.  Renovations will include the following: upgraded plumbing and provisions for power with filtered and isolated services for specialized instrumentation; installation of new cabinetry to make existing space more efficient to accommodate new equipment; installation of new fume hoods where required; and upgraded security measures for laboratories. This project will enhance the institution's goal of being the largest producer of African American physicists at the doctoral level. Improved facilities complement the Department's mission of striving for national and international excellence in research and teaching in physics and ensures that students of African American descent are given the opportunity to achieve their fullest potential in physics.",
