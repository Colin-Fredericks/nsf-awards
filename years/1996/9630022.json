 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hybrid automaton is a promising model for studying the  behavior of hybrid systems. One drawback of this model is  the difficulty in deriving decidable or semidecidable  procedures. The suspension automaton is a subclass of linear  hybrid automata for which decidable language containment  procedures exist. The objective of this project is to  investigate  the use of  suspension automaton to accurately  model and verify real-time systems. Due to the complexity of  these problems, a methodical way to study them is called  for, such as would be provided by a software tool.  This project is designed to explore the issues involved in  building an implementation of verification techniques based  on the suspension automaton. Two specific issues must be  addressed.  First, the relation of this work to existing  work, particularly in the area of real-time systems, must be  established. Second, a specific approach to building such a  tool must be formulated. Both of these goals may be aided by  establishing contact with researchers in the real-time area,  particularly those who are have produced software tools to  study real-time systems.  ***",
