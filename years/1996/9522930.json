The field  of manufacturing is on the verge of a revolution in the level of  intelligence which will become possible and necessary during the  next decade.  This award under the NSF/CONACyT Initiative funds a  collaboration between robotics investigators at the University of  Texas at Austin and researchers at the Instituto Tecnologico y de  Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) laboratories at  Cuernavaca and Mexico City to develop foundation technologies  needed for high performance, reconfigurable, and fault tolerant  robots and manufacturing cells for the next generation production  facilities.    The laboratory at Austin will concentrate on the foundation  technologies for highly reliable, fault tolerant, and  reconfigurable communications within production systems.  This  includes the creation of the best software structure and  standardized reconfigurable interfaces at all connections in the  system.  The appropriate level of granularity, multiplexing,  protocols, etc.  will be developed to provide configuration  management schemes to most rapidly and reliably avoid a fault in  the data transfer including buffers to allow for transition time  without loss of control information.  The ITESM labs at Mexico  City and Cuernavaca will focus on hardware and operational  software for the manufacturing cells.",
