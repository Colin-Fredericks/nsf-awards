 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514557  Walsh    An  exciting,  unresolved question in  neuroscience  is  how  animals acquire and store memories.  For mammals there is an  identified site, the hippocampus, at which memory processing  appears  to occur.  The structure and function of this  site  is  known in some detail,  however the nature of the  inputs  that  control  the  functioning of  hippocampal  neurons  is  largely unknown.  One of the input brain regions, the medial  septum,  contains neurons that project to  and  control  the  hippocampus.   The  medial  septum  appears   to   integrate  subcortical  information about the 'biological significance'  of   episodes   or   events  and  in   turn   modulate   the  responsiveness  of the hippocampus to its primary,  cortical  input.  Septal neurons release two types of neurotransmitter  molecules,  acetylcholine  and  GABA,  which  modulate   the  physiology  of  hippocampal neurons and  hence  the  memory-  related  functions  of the hippocampus.   Studies  conducted  through  funding by this award examine the neurotransmitters  and  brain circuits involved in a specific type of  learning  related  to  remembering a position in space.   One  set  of  experiments  is  designed to examine  whether  site-specific  manipulations     of    different    molecular     receptors  (benzodiazepine receptors), in the medial septum, will alter  the activity of septal neurons and of memory processes.   In  other  experiments,  tests are conducted  to  determine  the  physiological mechanisms through which intraseptal injection  of   a  receptor  blocker  drug  (flumazenil)  enhances  the  activity  of  neurons  that project to the  hippocampus  and  increases working memory.    These  studies  should  provide a  better  understanding  of  specific  brain  circuits and neurochemical mechanisms  that  control memory in mammals.  The expectation is that  such  a  detailed understanding of a specific type of learning  at  a  specific  site  will  contribute importantly  to  a  general   understanding of how animals learn, and remember  what  they  learn.",
