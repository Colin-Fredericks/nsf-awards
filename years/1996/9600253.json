 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a World Wide Web interface for  the Evolution of Terrestrial Ecosystems (ETE) Database. ETE  is an international project, designed to allow broad-scale  comparisons of the paleobiology and paleoecology of  terrestrial ecosystems and their plant and animal  communities. Currently the Database contains information on  over 8,000 fossil localities and more than 5,000 plant and  animal species.  It is accessed through an X-Window  graphical interface, which allows one to plot fossil  localities on maps displayed on screen, to query the screen  display, and to construct output data sets for other  analysis programs.     Currently, the user interface application (called  \"Explorer\") runs only on the host that also runs the  project's database management software (Ingres).  This makes  the Explorer an effective tool in the context of a local  network, but a user at a remote site must operate the  interface (maps, menus, etc.) from across the Internet and  must transfer via FTP any analysis output files to use  locally. Users outside of North America find international  network access too slow to use the Explorer during certain  peak hours.     This project will port Explorer to the Java computer  language (JavaSoft, Mountain View, CA).  A Java object file  can be executed on any computer that has a Java interpreter  without recompiling.  Java interpreters are available for  all major PC and workstation platforms, and are built in to  WWW browsers such as Netscape 2.0 and HotJava.  From within  a Web browser, a special form of a Java application (called  an \"applet\") is downloaded to the user's computer (via a  standard WWW link to a URL), where it is executed.  The  result is a level of interactivity and complex behavior  previously unavailable on the WWW.  The new version of the  Explorer will thus take the form of a Java applet embedded  within a standard WWW HTML document. The result will be a  robust, Internet-based, interactive, interface providing the  Explorer's GI S-style approach to data exploration.  That  architecture will greatly increase the accessibility of the  database to paleobiologists world-wide and catalyze  additional research community feedback and professional  interaction on the project.  A WWW client for ETE will also  likely make the database a significant resource for formal  and informal education in paleobiology.",
