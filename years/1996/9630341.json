 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630341  Grusak  This award supports studies on the processes, regulatory mechanisms, and cellular compartments that are involved in the transport of micronutrient metals in higher plants.  The capacity to mobilize iron, copper, zinc and mangenese in the phloem transport system will be studied using a combination of physiological, biochemical and analytical approaches.  Special emphasis will be given to identifying the endogenous metal-binding compounds (chelators) that are involved in the loading and transport of metal ions in the phloem system.  Pea will be used as the experimental system.      Details on the cellular events and endogenous compounds involved in the transport of metals in higher plants will provide the foundation for identifying regulatory mechanisms that mediate the integration of metal-associated processes from source tissues to the whole-plant level.  Because the transport of metals and other nutrients to developing sink regions of the plant is often entirely dependent on phloem delivery, and because metals play such an integral role in numerous metablic functions, the understanding gained in this research will have significant relevance to improving the nutritional quality of seeds, ensuring successful seed germination and early seedling development, enhancing the process of phytoremediation, and manipulating metal-induced gene expression in sink tissues.",
