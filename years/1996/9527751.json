 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527751  Mortensen    This research uses techniques developed under a prior NSF  grant to study microplasticity near inclusions embedded in  an elastoplastic material subjected to a uniform far-field  stresses.  The program employs silver chloride (AgCl) as a  model material for the study of metals containing  reinforcements or inclusions larger than a micrometer in  size.  AgCl is an ionic solid which deforms by dislocation  slip and its similarity with a metal from that standpoint is  well established.  Unlike a metal, AgCl is transparent,  stress birefringent, and allows for the observation of  dislocations at low densities by ambient-temperature  decoration with metallic silver.  Data are quantitatively  compared with two existing models for the deformation  behavior of two-phase materials, the Eshelby equivalent  inclusion method and finite element techniques.  The  differences, if any, between the empirical results and the  predictions of the models help guide efforts to incorporate  microstructural features and dislocation mechanics into  future models.  %%%  This study provides experimental micromechanical data,  sampled within a well-established metal analog, at a  microscopic scale and within bulk material.  Results from  this work are relevant to a wide array of engineering  structural materials, including two-phase alloys and metal-  matrix composites.  ***",
