 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hawaiian islands have an extraordinary endemic biota. Modern  ecological and evolutionary studies of this biota are limited by  logistic problems of  remote locations and the absence of field stations near those  locations. Critical conservation studies of endangered species are  similarly limited. With initial funding from the World Environment and  Resources Program of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation,  the University of Hawaii is constructing a biological field station at  Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge on the Island of Hawaii. The  33,000 acre refuge, located at 6000 ft elevation on the eastern slope  of Mauna Kea, contains 6 species of Hawaiian Honeycreepers in old  growth ohia-koa forest, 5 additional species of native birds, the hoary  bat, and 6 species of endangered or candidate plants. This will be the  first field station in the state of Hawaii that is located in a remote  area near the significant biota and that is designed for education as  well as research. The objective of this proposal is to complete  construction of two major buildings and outfit the station with an  initial phase of appropriate furnishings and equipment.    Funds would be used to finish a dormitory building that can sleep 20  people and a main building that has a kitchen, large dining\\all purpose  room, 2 offices, a laboratory, and a workroom. The current state of the  buildings is advanced framing. The remote location requires rural  technology for production and storage of electricity, and for  collection and use of water. The location also requires wheel-drive  vehicles. Furnishings for the buildings include office furniture,  chests of drawers, and tables and chairs for meeting and dining. The  general design of the finished facility provides user friendly  conditions for long-term residents: vehicles to get to remote study  sites; simple but comfortable sleeping and eating conditions; gathering  places; power, space, and equipment for working indoors during the  evening and du ring inclement weather; a cellular telephone; and a  washing machine.    The first phase of new scientific equipment includes computer  workstations. These will enable residents to be productive during  evenings and foul weather. The computers will also be the sites of  curation of long-term data sets that documemt the ecological  heterogeneity on established study areas on the refuge. They will  eventually be integrated with a series of weather stations in  established study areas and a GPS\\GIS system as part of a future second  phase of equipping.",
