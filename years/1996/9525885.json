One principal investigator  is a computational materials scientist while the other is a  computational scientist.  A primary objective of this  research is to develop computer codes for materials modeling  on advanced platforms which utilize the combined expertise  of these two researchers.    The goal of the research is to develop computational methods  which fully utilize innovations in high performance  computers in order to open new applications of electronic  structure codes to complex materials.  The focus of the  research will be on real space methods through higher order  finite difference techniques to electronic structure  problems.  Finite difference techniques coupled with ab  initio pseudopotentials can provide a simple, yet accurate  and efficacious, approach to complex systems.    A few of the advantages of finite difference techniques over  more traditional plane wave techniques include:         finite difference techniques are far easier to  implement than plane wave codes    with no loss of accuracy,  especially for parallel implementations;         these techniques to not require the use of supercells  for localized systems.  No    cell-cell interactions are  present.  Charged systems can be handled directly  without artificial compensating backgrounds.  Replication of  vacuum is natural   and minimized compared to extended basis  sets;         finite difference algorithms result in a minimum factor  of 4-5 gain in speed over     plane wave techniques for  shared memory architectures.  Significantly better  performance is expected for massively parallel platforms;         no fast-Fourier transforms are required.  Global  communications are minimized.    Applications will center on electronic materials such as  large clusters, liquids and amorphous s olids.  Algorithm  development will concentrate on designing parallel  preconditioners for the eigenvalue problem, as well as the  implementation of these techniques on various paralllel  platforms.  %%%  This computational materials science grant is co-funded by  the Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials  Research and the New Technologies Program in the Advanced  Scientific Computing Division.
