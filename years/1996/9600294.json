Moon to work at Kumamoto University Medical School,  Kumamoto, Japan.  Dr. Moon will collaborate with Dr.  Hidenori Terasaki, Chairman of the Department of  Anesthesiology, on a project entitled: \"Pressurized Gas  Transport for Intravascular Oxygenation'.    The proposed research will consist of building an efficient  intravascular oxygenator (artificial lung) to provide life  support while allowing damaged lungs to heal and will focus  on developing materials and techniques for the pressurized  transport of oxygen into blood.  Drs. Terasaki and Moon  propose to exploit the high strength and nonlinear gas-  transport behavior of recently developed microporous  materials. Although these materials can withstand high  internal pressures, they have been used only under negative  pressure in earlier oxygenator designs.  As positive  pressure can substantially increase oxygen delivered to the  blood, thermal-mass flow controllers, originally developed  for the semiconductor industry, will be used to measure the  pressure to flow relationship of microporous materials when  immersed in water, albumin plus water, and blood.  Data from  the experiments will be developed into a mathematical model  to predict the \"bubble-point pressure\" of an implanted  oxygenator and, following this analysis,  prototypes of  extracorporeal and intravascular oxygenators will be  constructed for tests in animals by the researchers in the  laboratory.  ***",
