One aspect of the project is the  study of the application of threshold partitioning algorithms for  sparse matrices.  The emphasis of the project is on singular  systems.       Singular systems of equations arise in many applications,  including certain types of differential equations modeling  physical phenomena, Markov chains, and queuing models.  Markov  chains are used, e.g., to evaluate the performance of computer  systems, while queuing models in particular simulate traffic in  telecommunication networks.  This project develops fast methods  for solving linear systems of equations, particularly singular  systems.  The methods are iterative: starting from an initial  guess at the solution of a system, the method produces a sequence  of approximate solutions that approaches the actual solution.  Asynchronous methods for parallel computers refer to methods in  which part of the computation is performed in each processor in  an asynchronous way, i.e., without synchronization between the  processors.  In other words, each processor proceeds with its  tasks, using the information available at any given moment  without waiting for the other processors to finish their tasks.  Processors do not wait: they keep active computing better  approximations to the solutions.  Therefore the overall solution  time can be greatly reduced.  The variables of the differential  equations, of the Markov chains, or of the queuing models, may be  partitioned naturally into sets of variables, e.g., by the  near-connectivity of the nodes of a network or graph.  This  partition induces a particular block structure in the matrix  representing the linear system to be solved.  Asynchronous  parallel methods are well suited to deal with these blocks.  New  partitioning algorithms that take into account the values of the  matrix are explored.  The discre tizations of many differential  equations, such as certain convection-diffusion equations, give  rise to matrices with coefficients varying over a wide range of  values, i.e., some large and some very small.  These problems are  very hard to solve in practice, and most modern iterative methods  fail to converge.  The methods that do converge are very expensive  or very slow.  Partitioning algorithms that take into account  these values can be used to permute these matrices so that the  large coefficients lie along the diagonal of the matrix.  Parts of  this permuted matrix, e.g., its blocks along the diagonal, can be  used as an effective preconditioner.  Preliminary experiments  indicate that this approach leads to fast convergence.  Thus, the  project can provide a method to efficiently solve a class of  important problems in science and engineering.",
