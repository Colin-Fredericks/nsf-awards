Buston       In 1859, Charles Darwin put forward one of the most  profound ideas in the history of science; the idea of  evolution by natural selection.  Since Darwin, it has become  widely accepted that natural selection should favor  individuals that behave in ways that maximize their total  number of surviving offspring.  In this context cooperative  breeding is an evolutionary paradox because it refers to  social systems  where individuals forego their own reproduction and assist  others in the care of young.    The proposed research will test the robustness of current  theory concerning the evolution of cooperative breeding by  investigating its applicability to the marine environment  for the first time.    The research proposed will investigate the breeding system  of the Clown anemonefish Amphiprion percula in Madang  Lagoon, Papua New Guinea.  At this site, groups composed of  a breeding pair and 0 - 6 juveniles defend anemones as  reproductive territories.  Three questions will be  investigated:  1) do juveniles at the anemone increase the  number of offspring of the breeders?  Preliminary data, from  a 1995  pilot study, suggests that juveniles do indeed increase the  number of offspring of the breeding pair.  2) how do the  juveniles increase the number of offspring of  the breeders?  3) what are the evolutionary costs and  benefits of the breeding system to the juveniles?  The  project will combine year round field  observations, experimental manipulations, and molecular  analysis of kin relationships.    The anemonefishes offer a unique opportunity to expand our  knowledge of behavioral plasticity in animal societies.  Athorough understanding of the breeding system within the  studied population will facilitate comparisons with other  populations of A. percula which have different mating  systems, as well as with other anemonefishes which live  throughout the tropical and sub-tropical Ind opacific.  The  research will be of interest to behavioral and evolutionary  biologists, as well as tropical fish hobbyists because the  anemonefishes are some of the most popular salt water  aquarium fish.",
