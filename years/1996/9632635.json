The research  combines experimental and theoretical studies to predict the  stability, properties, and appropriate pressure range for  the synthesis of novel target phases of nitride glasses,  oxide perovskites, carbon nitrides, and chalcogenides.  Additional research efforts address the process of  vitrification in amorphous materials and the synthesis and  characterization of epitaxial nitride films.  The MRSEC  supports shared experimental facilities for materials  research, exploratory research through seed funding, and  collaborations with industry and other academic  institutions.  Educational outreach programs include  development of educational modules on materials science for  middle school students and a collaborative research program  with the College of Eastern Utah.  The Center supports 13  senior investigators, 4 postdoctoral research associates, 12  graduate students, 1 technician, and 5 undergraduates.  The  MRSEC is directed by Prof. Paul McMillan.  %%%  The Material Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC)  at Arizona State University supports research on the  synthesis of new families of materials, with a focus on the  synthesis of materials at high pressures.
