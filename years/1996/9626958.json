Focusing on earthquakes,  severe storms, and volcanoes, the exhibit will promote a greater  understanding of the meteorological and geological forces that  underlie these phenomena.  Visitors will also learn about how  scientists monitor and predict natural events, more about how these  natural events affect our lives, and critical safety measures that  people should take during these dangerous events.  The exhibit will  include a rich array of immersion experiences, hands-on interactive  activities, historical photographs, modern data and imagery,  artifacts, and personal stories.  An Educator's Guide containing  background information and classroom activities will be developed  and circulated in a printed publication as well as electronically  on the Franklin's WWW home page (Http:\\\\sln.fi.edu).  The exhibit  will open at the Franklin Institute in October, 1997 and will  circulate among the seven other science museums that are part of  the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative.  It is estimated that 2.5  million people will see the exhibit during its 42-month tour.",
