 "awd_abstract_narration": "9561330  Moore         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a differential absorption meter optimized for frazil ice detection. Small crystals known as frazil ice form when heat is removed from a turbulent water body that is at, or below the freezing point. This process proves a major factor in ice formation of northern lakes and exposed polar oceanic bodies, and plays an important role in numerous physical and biological processes. In addition frazil ice formation can severely impact various cold-climate industrial water use processes. Yet the mechanism, it's prevalence, and the associated dynamics remain poorly understood, largely for lack of effective instrumentation. Researchers recently successfully tested a measurement technique in which the differential absorption of water and ice were determined to yield ice crystal concentration. This technique shows great promise in becoming an accepted method if an instrument can be developed to effectively exploit it. Phase I effort will focus upon the development and testing of a proof of principal prototype.       Commercial uses of the meter range from research applications to environmental and process monitoring. Potential customers include scientists, government agencies, hydroelectric power authorities, municipal water authorities, shipping companies and other industrial concerns.",
