 "awd_abstract_narration": "Standards for Introductory College Mathematics Before  Calculus was developed with funding from the National  Science and the Exxon Education Foundations to address the  special needs of, establish standards for, and make  recommendations about introductory college mathematics below  the level of calculus. The standards provide goals for  introductory college mathematics and guidelines for  selecting content and instructional strategies for  accomplishing these goals.    The goal of the project proposed is to facilitate the  implementation of the Standards.  This will be accomplished  by holding four regional workshops. The purposes of these  workshops include the following:     to inform a wider audience of the reform issues and  proposed patterns and models for improving curriculum and  instruction,     to encourage the formation of consortia of two- and four-  year colleges and universities in each of several regions  which will continue to work on implementation projects     to review current exemplary programs, materials, and  activities at the introductory college mathematics level as  well as relevant secondary programs based on the NCTM  Standards     to provide workshop participants information on relevant  research in mathematics education, effective approaches to  change, and suggestions for working with their  administrations to provide a meaningful mathematics  education for their students.     to prepare a compilation of reports on the implementation  projects begun as a result of the regional workshops and to  make this available to all members of the mathematics  community.    Introductory college mathematics is the mathematics that  most of our students study. It is mathematics for the  workforce, for future teachers and for those who plan to  major in mathematics or a mathematics-dependent field but  who enter college unprepared to study calculus. It is also  the gate-keeper or critical filter for the majority. Greater  numbers of students are entering the mathematics \"pipeline \"  at some point in introductory college mathematics but no  more are continuing to calculus and higher level courses.  Mathematics education at this level must change. Providing  faculty with development opportunities is essential if  change is to occur. The workshops proposed will enable  faculty and administrators to learn about successful  programs that embody the Standards, to have an opportunity  to observe or experience the process of learning through  working in groups, in a laboratory setting, or using  technology, or to engage in any of the active learning  processes recommended by the Standards.",
