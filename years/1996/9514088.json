The project  will focus on a particularly robust and widespread aspect of  mate choice, preference for opposite-sex partners (sexual  partner preference), and a species well-suited to the goal,  the zebra finches treated with estrogen during the first two  weeks posthatch and housed in an all-female zebra finches  treated with estrogen during the first two weeks posthatch  and housed in an all-female environment from 40 days  (independence from the parents)to 100 days (young adulthood)  then prefer to pair with other females.  In order to address  important questions raised by this discovery, a series of  experiments will be conducted in which annals are exposed to  different hormonal or social environment manipulations  during development and then tested for sexual partner  preference--organizational effects of hormones produce early  in development, and sexual imprinting--and will elucidate  the manner in which hormonal and experiential influences  interact during development.  This work will advance our  understanding of mate choice and of reproductive behavior  development.",
