 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612003    Duffie   This research involves heterarchical manufacturing systems in which control is highly distributed among loosely-coupled autonomous entities that retain a minimal amount of global information.  The goal of this research is to establish a nonlinear dynamical systems theory for modeling and analysis of real-time distributed control in part-driven heterarchical manufacturing systems with batch sizes as low as unity and Just-In-Time production.  Major issues to be addressed are (1) innovative continuous feedback control topologies for general multiple machine configurations, (2) dynamical models that characterize the behavior of general multiple machine configurations, and (3) rigorous analysis of system dynamics including state trajectories, stability, steady-state values, convergence properties, and robustness.  Challenging research issues include modeling nonlinearities and analyzing system dynamics when there is more than one machine for a given processing step and when parts have to visit more than one such processing step.  Real-time scheduling performance and robustness to disturbances will be evaluated in the laboratory.   This research is novel and highly relevant to industry needs.  There are many non-trivial issues to surmount making this relatively high risk, but if successful, will represent major advances.",
