 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to enhance students' understanding of nutrient dynamics in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by providing a more comprehensive analysis of different ions using a Dionex ion chromatograph (IC).  Previously, many environmentally oriented courses have lacked detailed water chemistry information because of the time-consuming nature of wet chemistry techniques (e.g., titration and spectrophotometric methods).  Therefore, students have not always witnessed first-hand all of the more interesting nutrient pathways present in a particular ecosystem.  With the IC, students are able to quantify many different anions and cations.  This enables them to track more ions as they enter ecosystems in precipitation and then observe how concentrations change as water moves through a forest canopy (with comparisons between pine, spruce, tamarack, and deciduous forests).  Furthermore, through groundwater and surface water sampling, students are gaining a better understanding of how geology and abiotic processes affect nutrient cycles.  They are also able to make comparisons of vertical profiles of nutrients between productive and unproductive lakes, as well as lakes in limestone versus granite regions.  This instrument is assisting in the formation of collaborative laboratories between courses in biology, geology, and environmental studies, some of which involve gathering data on environmental problems suggested by the Madison County Planning Office.  These collaborations demonstrate to students the relatedness of science in different disciplines and the importance of an interdisciplinary understanding and approach when studying the environment.",
