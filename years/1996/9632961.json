 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632961  Shuler  The goal of this proposed research is to identify and investigate  the biosynthetic significance of an unknown taxane recently  discovered in the Principle Investigators laboratory while  performing plant tissue culture experiments with certain  metabolic inhibitors.  These experiments involved the culture of  Taxus species which produce Taxol, an important new anti-cancer  drug.  It is currently generally accepted that baccatin III is  the direct biosynthetic precursor of Taxol.  However, recent  experiments by the PI indicate that baccatin III could be  selectively and completely inhibited without any significant  effect on Taxol production.  Other inhibition experiments have  shown the accumulation of a single unknown taxane, which is not  baccatin III, but which could,, in fact, be the direct precursor  of Taxol.  This proposal outlines a multidisciplinary approach to  identify this unknown compound and investigate its biosynthetic  significance using knowledge of manipulation of Taxol production  by Taxus cell cultures, and established techniques in  biosynthetic chemistry.  ***",
