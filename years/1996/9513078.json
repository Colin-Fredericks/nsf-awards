 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513078  Lanyi    This award supports the participation of 14 U.S. scientists  in a U.S.-Japan seminar on the Structural Basis of  Information and Energy Transduction in Retinal Proteins, to  be held in Kyoto, Japan, from March 16-20, 1997.  The co-  organizers are Professors Janos K. Lanyi of the University  of California, Irvine and Akio Maeda of the University of  Kyoto.  The purpose of this seminar is to assess recent  progress in understanding the structural basis for the  function of retinal proteins.  These proteins are currently  under intense investigation because they participate in  energy and information transfer, both essential for life.  Leading researchers from the U.S. and Japan will interact  and exchange ideas so as to develop new concepts and  experimental approaches to study retinal proteins as light  receptors. Specifically, the seminar will include topics on  excited state dynamics, photochemical reaction kinetics,  protein conformation changes, proton conduction mechanisms,  thermodynamics, signal transduction in vision and in  phototaxis, and photosensors based on retinal proteins.  The  U.S. participants were selected on the basis of being the  most active researchers in the rhodopsin field.  Therefore,  this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its  exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through  international collaboration.  ***",
