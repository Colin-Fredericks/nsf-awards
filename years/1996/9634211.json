 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634211  Dunn    This Dissertation Improvement research deals with the privileged status of the scientific observer, which for the most part goes unrecognized when the researcher is preoccupied with using aggregate data.  The uniqueness of the project is to study one small world-system at the moment of it's incorporation into an expanding larger one through the eyes of explorers.  The small world-system of the ancient Hawaiian archipelago before that system was transformed and incorporated in to the modern world-system in the early nineteenth century will be examined.   This will be accomplished through studying the relative validity of different kinds of  data and using  these data to make inferences about structural positions of  different polities within the Hawaiian world-system.   The general hypothesis being tested  is that what is \"known\" about the social complexity of Hawaii at the turn of 19th century did not arise from observation of facts alone, but the perceptions of the explorers were shaped by social and historical circumstances.  The data for this research is mainly from accounts of Russian voyagers.  Through examining particular individuals' representations of events several theses of the world-system approach, e.g. concerning the interplay between more and less hierarchical neighbors will be tested.  The study seemingly suggests a need to move away from broad studies of total exchange distribution to more sensitive studies of contextual based knowledge about the exchange acts.  ***",
