 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in network and processor technology are greatly changing  the communication and computational power of local-area clusters  of workstations and personal computers.  In particular, the  replacement of Ethernets by newer switched network technologies,  which provide both higher throughput and lower latency, presents  an opportunity for operating systems to better use network  resources.  This research seeks to improve the performance of  applications through distributed (cluster-wide) resource  management.  The project will develop algorithms that permit the  effective sharing of all network resources:  processors, network,  memory, and disk storage.   For example, programs on heavily-  loaded nodes can use available memory on idle nodes for both file  system and virtual memory backing store, rather than disk,  thereby reducing the data latency on access to that data.  As another example, applications may migrate to nodes that  provide either a better processing environment or a better memory  environment for their execution.  A key issue in developing  algorithms for such closely-coupled system is finding the right  balance in order to optimize system-wide performance while  minimizing any degradation of performance on individual systems  as a result of network-wide resource sharing.  ***",
