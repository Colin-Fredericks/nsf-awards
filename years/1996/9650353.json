 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is intended to foster a more comprehensive knowledge of research methods and to infuse students with an enthusiasm for doing research. The major goal of this project is to enhance the undergraduate course in experimental psychology by expanding the number of computer workstations and supporting software for conducting students experiments. All laboratory workstations used in the project are being linked to the university network, thereby providing access to the distributed resources of the university library, most other state university libraries, the Internet, and the World Wide Web.    In addition to enhancing the in-laboratory information retrieval capabilities, the project is making much of the course information available to students and interested parties through the networking of the laboratory and a class website. The monitored laboratory is open for student use 40 hours per week. The primary software, MacLaboratory Psychology, is a research-grade tool that consists of a number of experimental modules that stimulate students to explore a variety of research problems in general experimental psychology using both basic and advanced research methods. The project also provides students with powerful statistical software (STATVIEW and SuperNOVA) with which to analyze the results of the experiments they conceive, execute, and report.",
