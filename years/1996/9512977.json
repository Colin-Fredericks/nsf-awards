 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several research groups at Rutgers/UMDNJ have focused on the  molecular characterization of newly-identified membrane proteins  (channels, receptors, transporters) in animal and plant systems. Use of  molecular genetic approaches has led to the cloning of putative cDNAs  encoding polypeptide components of these membrane proteins. Rapid  advancement of the research programs characterizing these cDNAs will,  in the near future, depend on the capability to characterize the  transport functions facilitated by the translation products of the  cDNAs. One state-of-the-art technology which can be employed to  facilitate this characterization is oocyte expression/patch clamp  analysis. This involves the microinjection of cRNA transcribed from  these cDNAs into frog (Xenopus laevis) oocytes, leading to translation  and functional expression of the transport proteins in oocyte  membranes. Monitoring of ion currents across the plasmalemma of oocytes  expressing these proteins by use of patch/voltage clamp equipment can  then be employed to study the specific transport functions of these  gene products. This proposal seeks funds to set up the first oocyte  expression/patch clamp analysis system at Rutgers.        The research programs described in this proposal will all make  use of this equipment to gain insights into the structure/function  relationships of the target membrane proteins. The specific research  objectives which will be perused by investigators using the proposed  equipment are as follows. 1 ) lon channel genes heretofore not known to  be present in plants will be characterized. Specifically, cDNAs  encoding a   subunit of plant K+ channels, a ligandgated type 11 (30-40  kD polypeptide) K+ channel native to an intracellular plant membrane,  and a K+ channel which has a unique pore sequence (unknown previously  in plant or animal membranes) and is a likely candidate for the Na+  uptake pathway in plants will be studied. 2) Polypeptide components of  the enzyme complex involved in plant ce ll wall callose (cellulose)  biosynthesis will be characterized. The cDNAs encoding these  polypeptides share sequence homology with members of the MIP (major  intrinsic protein) or aquaporin gene family. 3) A cDNA encoding a novel  member of the family of glutamate (Glu) family of excitatory amino acid  receptors will be characterized. Glu receptors (GluRs) mediate rapid  excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system.  GluRs are a type of cation channel known as ionotropic receptors. The  cloned cDNA encodes a unique splice variant that is a truncated  receptor form of a GluR. 4. Nuclear-encoded proteins are imported into  plant cell chloroplasts via specific channels spanning the double  membrane delimiting the organelle. A complex of six chloroplast  envelope membrane proteins have been identified as components of the  chloroplast protein import machinery. A cDNA encoding one of these  proteins, IAP75, has been cloned. Sequence analysis of IAP75 indicates  that it has secondary structure similarity to channel proteins such as  bacterial outer membrane porins. The porinlike nature of IAP75 will be  characterized.",
