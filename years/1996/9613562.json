 "awd_abstract_narration": "9613562  Braden  The project responded to the NSF/EPA solicitation for  proposals for research on the topic of Water and Watersheds.  The work will study the renewal of large floodplain river  ecosystems which are found in many areas of the United  States especially in the Midwestern States.  The project  will focus on the conditions of the Upper Mississippi River  Basin, using a section of the Illinois River as the study  site.  This river is one of the only three large floodplain  river systems that retain an appreciable annual flood pulse.  The river also has a high ecological potential which has  been diminished by water management practices.  A model that  will integrate the river hydrology, ecology and economy will  be developed for the simulation of the interactions of flood  plain and river uses, such as agriculture, navigation,  recreation, commercial fishing and forestry, with species  carrying capacity.  The model will have a policy component  that will examine the significance of these uses and water  management on systems outcomes.  The results from this  research will improve the management of the watershed  resources and the organizations responsible for it, and the  experience will be transferable to other large floodplain  river systems.  ***",
