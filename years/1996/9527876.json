 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anderson  OPP 9527876    Abstract  This award supports continuation of a long term investigation of  the continental shelf sediments that is aimed at examining the  configuration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet during the last  glacial maximum, the events and mechanisms involved in its  retreat, and the timing of retreat.  The project involves: 1)  characterizing variations in the ice sheet grounding zone in a  latitudinal transect extending from Ross Sea to Bransfield Basin,  2) reconstructing conditions at the ice/bed interface prior to  and after ice sheet retreat, and 3) radiometrically dating ice  sheet retreat along this transect.  Detailed sea floor imagery  (multibeam and deep-tow side-scan sonar), high resolution seismic  reflection profiles, and sediment cores will be used to map and  characterize prior grounding zones.  Of particular concern are  features that  indicate the amount and organization  (channelization) of basal meltwater and the extent of bed  deformation that occurred in different ice streams.  The timing  of ice sheet retreat provides information about the link between  Northern and Southern hemisphere ice expansion, and the role of  eustasy in ice sheet decoupling.  This research should lead to  better predictive models to determine which ice streams are most  unstable and likely, therefore, to serve as Oweak linksO in the  long term behavior of West Antarctic Ice Sheet.",
