 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Keys Marine Laboratory (KML) commenced academic  research and  education programs in the 1980's through a public/private  partnership  between the Florida Institute of Oceanography (FIO) and Sea  World of  Florida, Inc. Based on the success of that partnership and  recognizing  the need for these programs and facilities the State of  Florida  purchased the KML in 1990. With the closure of other  residential  laboratory facilities in the region and the unprecedented  scientific  and political attention on the mosaic of South Florida  environments,  the KML has now assumed an even more critical support role.  In the last  five years usage by research and education groups has  increased  steadily and is beginning to exceed some of the capabilities  of the  current facilities. Particularly urgent is the need for  improved and  expanded housing accommodations for non-resident  researchers. Lodging  has been identified as one of the major impediments to  conducting  research in the region. Laboratory and boat facilities are  equally  important but at this point in time the KML can reasonably  accommodate  these needs. This project will provide funding to construct  the first  unit of a planned three-unit handicapped accessible housing  facility  which will provide additional lodging space for two to four  (2-4)  researchers/unit. This facility will help meet the need of  regional,  national, and international scientists studying the  continentally  unique systems of South Florida, including coral reefs.",
