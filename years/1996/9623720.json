 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623720  Sridhar    This  project seeks to study the response to electromagnetic  waves  at microwave frequencies, of new superconducting  materials, such as  high temperature    superconductors  and   borocarbide    superconductors. Experiments  will  be  carried out using certain unique  facilities  to study  microwave response under a variety of conditions and  materials. This   response,   when  suitably  analyzed,  will yield important information about the paired state  of electrons and  the  motion  of superconducting  vortices  in these materials. In  addition  to  making fundamental  contributions to the understanding of high temperature and  borocarbide superconductors, this work will also have  important impact on   microwave   applications.  An  understanding  of  the intrinsic properties of the pure  systems, the the influence of purities, will provide  clues to improving the loss capabilities of microwave  devices. The  studies  of non-linear effects will be crucial  to  improving  the high  power  performance  of microwave  devices,  currently  a  serious limitation  to  the  successful application of  the  high  temperature  superconducting materials in this arena.  %%%  The   electromagnetic   response   of   high   and   low  temperature superconductors  will  be  investigated using  a  unique  experimental capability,  covering  a  wide  range  of  frequencies  (dc  to  fifty gigahertz), temperature (2  to 350 Kelvin) and magnetic field (0  to  7 Tesla).  The  program will address key current issues, such  as  order  parameter symmetry, quasiparticle density of states,  depairing effects of a magnetic field in the Meissner and  mixed states, c-axis transport including  coherent/incoherent quasiparticle tunneling and possibility  of  intrinsic  Josephson  junctions. A notable  feature  of  the  high temperature superconductors is their pronounced  non-linear response at moderate  microwave powers and field  amplitudes. An  understanding  of this  non-linearity in  terms of th e spatio-temporal dynamics  of  flux penetration  at high frequencies will be another theme of this project.  Experiments will be carried out on the non-linear impedance,  mixed acdc and harmonic/intermodulation response, in both  the frequency-domain and  time-domain,  and will be analyzed  in the framework  of  critical state models which can have  recently emerged.  ***",
