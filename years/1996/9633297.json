The BICE brings together in an independent forum expertise from a  wide range of scientific, engineering, and social science  disciplines to address problems and issues in the areas of  technology, science, and public policy applied to urban systems;  public facilities; infrastructure systems and services; above  ground and underground construction; the relationship  between the  constructed and natural environments and their interaction with  human activities; the effects of natural hazards on constructed  facilities; and related issues of planning, design, construction,  management, surety, and use of the built environment.  The BICE  provides a unique structure to respond to specific requests from  government, or to act on its own initiative with public or private  sector support.  In pursuit of its goals, BICE plans to conduct on-  going strategic planning and oversee committee activities involving  studies, workshop, symposia, and a variety of information  dissemination activities.",
