These studies will be carried out in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, which has relatively few muscle and nerve cells, and in which genetic experiments can be done.  For these experiments a reporter transgene has been introduced into the organism, since the degradation of its protein product can be easily followed.  This investigator previously found that this protein is stable in well-fed animals, but is broken down upon starvation. This instability is counteracted by signals from nerves to the muscles.  These experiments are aimed at understanding the molecular basis of the protein breakdown, the nerve signals that control it, and the mechanism by which nerve signals decrease protein breakdown. Earlier studies (in a previous grant) showed that the signaling involves release of acetylcholine by the nerves, reception of this signal at the surface of the muscles, and the consequent release of calcium ions from storage inside the muscles.  The calcium ions act by stimulating the enzyme protein kinase C (PKC) which slows the rate of protein breakdown.  In this proposal additional evidence for the role of PKC will be sought, the targets of PKC action will be determined, and experiments will done to determine how PKC slows the rate of protein breakdown.    A distinct group of muscle cells in this animal, that receives different chemical signals, will be examined to see whether the same or different signaling systems are operating.  The regulation of protein degradation is an important question, which these experiments will help to answer.   ***",
