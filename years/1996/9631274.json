 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9631274  Liu     This STTR Phase I project focuses on developing the polarization insensitive liquid-crystal Fabry-Perot (LC-FP) optical filter for wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) communication systems. It is well known that LC-FP is a high-performance filter due to its large tuning range, high finesse, and low voltage operations. However, because the modulation is based on the optical anisotropy, only the extra-ordinary wave can be modulated in the FP resonator. This results in a polarization sensitive filter that greatly reduces its \"field application\" in the WDM networks. Although polarization-diversity has been proposed and demonstrated to overcome this problem, it required polarization splitting/combining at the input/output ports and resulted in what effectively constitutes two FP cavities. This increases packaging and production difficulties, making high-volume commercial device manufacturing impractical. This project will use polarization optics to manipulate the arbitrarily polarized light in the FP cavity. By positioning the liquid crystal phase modulator in between crossed quarter-waveplates within the FP resonator, the filter becomes polarization independent. The device structure is simple and mass producible. Successful completion of this STTR program can resolve the polarization-sensitive drawback of the LC-FP filter and widen its application in the WDM networks.   The primary applications for this filter are in cable TV broadcasting, fiber-in-the-loop WDM networks, long distance telecommunication, and all-optical networks. This filter can also be applied to spectroscopic analysis and fiber-based environmental sensor applications.    ***",
