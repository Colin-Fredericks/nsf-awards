 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morris  9629639    The attenuation of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) within the water column of aquatic ecosystems varies strongly as a function of dissolved organic compounds that absorb ultraviolet wavelengths. This attenuation allows many organisms that are quite sensitive to ultraviolet radiation to persist in the plankton community though they may be inhibited in various ways near the surface. Among lakes, there is great variability in attenuation of ultraviolet radiation, which the investigators have successfully modeled as a simple function of dissolved organic carbon concentration. This model does not adequately explain large seasonal variations within lakes, however. The primary objective of the proposed research is to partition wavelength-specific attenuation coefficients into contributions from water, dissolved compounds, and particulate matter; and then to model seasonal changes in attenuation from changes in these components as driven by the dynamic interaction between ultraviolet irradiance and in situ photooxidation of dissolved organic carbon (i.e. to less absorptive compounds and to carbon dioxide)- The most significant feature of this interaction is a positive feedback operating during late spring and early summer, when increasing solar irradiance, decreasing attenuation coefficients. and shallow thermal stratification cause high ultraviolet exposure of organisms in the epilimnia of clear lakes. The work represents a novel season-by-season integration of incident ultraviolet radiation into the organic carbon cycling of lakes, including quantitative tests of: (1) photooxidation rates as predictors of seasonal changes in ultraviolet attenuation, 2) algal excretion and zooplankton grazing as UV-sensitive sources of UV-absorbing dissolved organic matter, (3) UVR-catalyzed increase in availability of dissolved organic carbon substrates for bacterial growth as a mitigation of direct negative effects of UVR on bacteria, and 4) seasonal adaptations in the phytoplankton community as mitiga tions to direct UVR photoinhibition of primary productivity.  Studies will be performed in small lakes on the Pocono Plateau of northeastern Pennsylvania, where differences in hydrology and land use have created a wide range of previously characterized limnological conditions. All studies are focused on a highly UV-transparent lake where the potential for direct biological effects is greatest. Most studies will contrast conditions in this lake with those in a slightly humic lake, where UVR photooxidation rates -- though high in absolute units -- leave enough residual UVR attenuation in midsummer to preclude most direct negative effects of ultraviolet radiation. Sampling for attenuation coefficients and dissolved and particulate matter will be 1-2 times per month throughout 2 full years in three lakes, adding a third slightly humic, eutrophic lake with seasonally high algal populations. Less frequent measurements of photooxidation, primary productivity, and UVR effects on bacteria and algal excretion will utilize quartz bottles exposed to natural solar radiation at the lake surface or at depth. Ultraviolet radiation will be measured continuously above, and periodically within, the lakes with multi-waveband radiometers in order to reconstruct spectral irradiance. Results from the study will contribute new and fundamental insights into the role of ultraviolet radiation as an ecological regulatory factor that were not attainable until the recent commercial availability of these instruments .",
