 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9632779  Tierney  This two-year project addresses three related questions: (1)  What longer-term consequences do disasters have for  individual businesses?, (2) What factors are associated with  differential disaster outcomes for businesses?, and (3) What  consequences does heavy and concentrated damage to business  and commercial districts have for business activity in those  high-damaged areas?  The project will focus on two  geographic areas that suffered severe damage and disruption  in two major disasters: Santa Cruz County, California and  its communities of Santa Cruz and Watsonville, which were  heavily damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake; and  Southern Dade County, Florida and its communities of  Homestead and Florida City, which sustained major damage in  Hurricane Andrew in 1992.  Two main tasks will be  undertaken: (1) conducting mail surveys on representative,  random samples of businesses in each area: and (2)  collecting interview data, social indicator data, and  archival material documenting what disaster-related changes,  if any, have taken place in heavily damaged business  districts.***",
