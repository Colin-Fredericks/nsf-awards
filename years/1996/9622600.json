 "awd_abstract_narration": "An invitational Forum on Teacher Preparation for Deans of Science  and of Education will be conducted by the American Association for  the Advancement of Science from February 21-23, 1996.  Fifty  institutional teams (each composed of a dean of education and a  dean of science from major research universities and comprehensive  universities with large teacher preparation programs) will attend  the meeting to consider ways in which collaborations among their  academic divisions and school personnel can better prepare future  teachers of K-12 science and mathematics.  The purposes of the  Forum are (1) to present a summary of the research results on the  teaching and learning of science and mathematics; (2) to consider  exemplary teacher preparation programs that model collaboration  among university science and education departments and local  schools or school districts; (3) to engage the deans in discussion  of the issues associated with the design and implementation of such  exemplary programs; and (4) to inform the deans of opportunities,  such as the National Science Foundation's Collaboratives for  Excellence in Teacher Preparation program, to engage in large-scale  systemic projects designed to change significantly teacher  preparation programs, on a state or regional basis, which will  serve as comprehensive national models.  Participants will receive  background information prior to the meeting.  Based upon  discussions and models presented at the Forum, a workbook,  including recommendations for collaborations and the components of  model teacher preparation programs, will be produced and made  available to participants and others interested in improving  teacher preparation.",
