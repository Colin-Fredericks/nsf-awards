In parallel processor systems, where multiple high performance  processors work cooperatively as one connected unit, performance is  determined by the effective utilization of processor nodes which,  predominately, depends upon communication efficiency. The backbone for  communication in parallel processing environments is the interconnection  network. We propose to design and implement in a hybrid GaAs/silicon chip a  flexible fully-adaptive deadlock-free optical network router featuring a  new packet routing algorithm universally applicable to any network  topology. This proposed research serves to further advance the  state-of-the-art in interconnection network technology by exploring  hardware-based solutions for increasing parallel processor communication  efficiency. This work leverages ofd of current trends in interconnection  network router architecture and continuing advancements in optical/photonic  technology.    Our proposed optical router provides a flexible framework for exploring  many design alternatives never before imagined due to its high degree of  resource decoupling and topological independence. Interesting issues to be  investigated in the building of the router include how to accurately detect  deadlock, how to efficiently implement the deadlockfree recovery lane, how  to implement low overhead internal and external flow control for optical  interconnects, and how to integrate optical transmitters, optical  receivers. and complex electronic router logic circuitry onto a single  optoelectronic VLSI router chip. Interesting issues that can be further  understood once the router is built include the performance and/or fault  tolerance advantages of fully adaptive wormhole routing, misrouting  capability, the use of the DB resource for not only recovering from  potential deadlocks but also for relieving n ormal network congestion, and  the use of dense high bandwidth optical I/O for fully adaptive network  routers. We will systematically address these and other important issues as  we go about designing, building, and experimenting with this novel network  router.    This research adds significantly to optical interconnect/photonic switching  infrastructure. This work is pioneering in that, to our knowledge, we are  the first to propose research that encompasses advanced switching, flow  control, and routing functionality in optical interconnection network  design. The principal investigator will lead a dedicated research team  ranging in research experience consisting of undergraduate, graduate. and  post-graduate collaborative researchers. Moreover, important research  achievements will find use in the classroom to serve as excellent  illustrations in teaching. Hence, we will demonstrate that current and  next-generation interconnection network techniques such as wormhole  switching, virtual channel flow, and adaptive routing are feasibly  incorporated in optically-based interconnection networks. This will provide  a platform on which to build optically interconnected parallel processing  systems, impacting the applicability of this technology to future systems.  ***",
