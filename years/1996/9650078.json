 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is the revitalization of an advanced senior-level design project laboratory in the wireless communications field. The design of a large mixed analog-digital project serves as a capstone design experience for the seniors by merging concepts from circuit, system, communication, and linear system theory into a single practical project. Only through the use of theory learned in lecture can the students truly grasp the material. The wireless project, incorporating some digital communications, helps to tie together many of the concepts of electrical engineering. The large size of the project, requiring about 10 students, is purposely configured to simulate an industrial product development cycle. The project is divided into smaller tasks that subteams of about three students can design and build. During the course of the project, each subteam is required to present to the entire team a review of their circuit specifications, a review of their design, and finally a review of the experimental results. Written documentation of the experimental results once the entire system is integrated is required. This experience helps the students to learn teamwork and communication skills and to see engineering concepts at work.",
