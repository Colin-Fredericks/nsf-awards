 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633351  Van Cappellen    Aluminum plays a major role in the benthic regeneration of nutrient  silicic acid and the preservation of biogenic opal in the  sedimentary record.  Based on results of a previous study of  sediments from the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, potential  mechanisms by which Al intervenes in the early diagenesis of silica  include: (1) primary uptake of Al by biosiliceous skeletons during  biomineralization, (2) secondary uptake of Al by biosiliceous  microfossils at the seafloor, (3) readjustment of the Al/Si ratio  of the surface layers of biosiliceous debris during burial, and (4)  simultaneous precipitation of pore water silica and aluminum.  This  study will test the proposed Al-Si interaction mechanisms and, in  doing so, build a quantitative basis for predicting their relative  importance in different marine depositional environments. Stirred  flow-through reactors will be used in the experiments, because they  allow the measurement of reaction kinetics under reproducible,  steady-state conditions. The effect of primary Al uptake during  biosilicification will be studied by measuring the steady state  rates of silicic acid production from high-Al and low-Al samples of  pure diatom cultures. The kinetics will be determined as a function  of the degree of saturation, temperature, pH and Al content of the  silica frustules. The early diagenetic interactions between silica  and soluble Al will be studied by supplying dissolved Al via the  input solution, or by adding a solid source of reactive Al to  biogenic silica suspended in the reactor. In the latter  experiments, a given amount of biogenic silica will be mixed with  increasing amounts of the solid Al source. This will mimic the  increased dilution of biogenic silica by detrital material in  marine sediments. The experimental results will allow to examine  the hypothesis that the asymptotic pore water silica level in  detrital-rich sediments represents a kinetic steady state between  production of silicic acid  by biogenic silica dissolution and  consumption by precipitation of authigenic Al-Si phases.  The Al/Si  stoichiometry of the authigenic precipitates will be obtained from  the relative rates of Al precipitation and silica reprecipitation  in the reactor experiments. Batch adsorption experiments will also  be used to constrain the levels of Al sorption at which secondary  Al uptake by biosiliceous surfaces switches from adsorption to the  formation of precipitates. Scanning electron microscopy and solid  state chemical analyses will complement the reactor-based  experiments.",
