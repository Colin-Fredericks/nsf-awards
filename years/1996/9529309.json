 "awd_abstract_narration": "Goodwin  9529309    In the last five years, considerable effort has been devoted to diagnostic analysis of the plumes of matter produced when pulsed lasers are used to ablate a solid target.  this has been primarily motivated by a desire to better understand the basic physical and chemical processes important to pulsed laser deposition, a newly popular thin film growth technique which is finding ever-increasing application to growth of superconductor, insulator and semiconductor structures.    The objective from laser-induced plumes, rather than to study exclusively plume formation.  The approach taken is a combined experimental and theoretical effort.  Briefly, the aim is to determine the extent to which film stoichiometry and microstructure are determined by:      Evolution of the energy distributions (both translational and internal) of the gas phase species as the plume approaches a substrate for thin film growth.  The incident species' energy will affect the sticking probability, the dissociate probability and mode of dissociation and incorporation (i.e., adsorption or implantation) of gas phase constituents into the films.    Evolution of species distributions as the plume moves from the target to the substrate, including formation of reactive intermediates in the gas phase, which then condense onto the solid surface.    Prominent aspects of the experimental work are laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements of gas phase plume an intermediate species in their electronic ground states, in situ surface analysis by reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and a complementary core level spectroscopy technique developed at Caltech, reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy (REELS).   Various forms of postgrowth film microstructural analysis will be used to analyze film stoichiometry, density, crystallinity, bonding state, and optical properties.  The theoretical work will involve several efforts, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of energetic plume-surface interact ions and Director-Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) simulations of gas-phase plume dynamics, including chemical kinetics and substrate interactions.  ***",
