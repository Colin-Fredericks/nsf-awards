 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal offers solutions to the wise and effective use of  Internet and multimedia, illustrated by concrete applications of  these technologies.  It will provide for summer workshops for  teachers, 2 and 4 year college faculty, community leaders, and some  in the local business community. The underlying networking  technologies developed by the lead 2 year college, and the evolving  new paradigm for its use provide a model for others in the nation  to consider.  Most of the content for these workshops will be based  on recent experience in creating the Community Networks (CoNets) in  Southeastern Minnesota, and a new 2-year curriculum in Networking  communicating (NetCo).  CoNet kiosks are linked collaboratively via  the Internet.  The NetCo curriculum will help and lead builders of  networking facilities. These workshop, directed at mostly 2-year  college faculty, will help them implement the developed 2-year  curriculum.  These proposed workshops in 1996 and 1997, will be  expanded from earlier ones given in 1995.  They will cover areas in  Minnesota, eastern Dakotas, northern Iowa, and western Wisconsin,  using 2-way interactive TV linked to the workshop providers at  Austin College Park. In 1997, the providers will attempt to expand  to the national level, to allow telecommunication of the workshops  to many other 2 and 4 year colleges.",
