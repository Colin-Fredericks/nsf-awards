 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, seeks to develop  mass spectrometry (MS) as a DNA sequencing tool using a  combination of aerosol liquid sample introduction and matrix-  assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight MS.   During the tenure of this four-year continuing grant, Professor  Murray and his students at Emory University will exploit the  advantages of this approach including no need for radioisotopes,  fluorescence or chromophore tagging of DNA, or sample  preparation.  This makes it easy to automate and single charged  fragments can be rapidly separated using the time-of-flight MS.   Problems inherent in aerosol MALDI to be obviated by the proposed  techniques include analyte fragmentation, poor limits of  detection and inadequate mass resolution.  Professor Murray's  educational plan involves revamping the undergraduate  instrumental analysis course at Emory University.  Introduction  of a MALDI MS into this course is planned.  On a broader scale  the entire undergraduate curriculum in chemistry at Emory  University is undergoing revision and reorganization due to the  rapid growth in faculty and in student enrollment.  Cross  disciplinary courses in biochemistry and enhanced opportunities  to have undergraduates engaged in research are planned.   Professor Murray has already started a graduate scientific  instrumentation course that will be expanded to involve more  active use of the World Wide Web resources in this course.  He is  also in charge of the seminar program and the analytical  cumulative exam program at Emory University and these vehicles  will be used to promote research interest among the graduate  students.    The field of DNA sequencing is especially active in many areas of  science for a host of reasons.  Professor Murray's goal to  develop a better technique for DNA sequencing via this CAREER  research project will expose students at Emory University to a  research frontier that is moving quickly and that has the  potential for enormous impact.  The integration of this science  between the normal educational and research venues is exciting  and the progress of this work will be interesting to follow.",
