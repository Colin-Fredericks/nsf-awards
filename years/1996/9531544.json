 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of undergraduate  biology students in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates  program offered by Emory University.  From extensive prior  experiences with undergraduate training, the faculty at Emory  have become convinced that meaningful research experiences are  the optimal way to encourage undergraduate students to enter  research careers in the biological sciences.  Recruitment efforts  for this program will continue to focus primarily on students  from regional undergraduate institutions, women and minority  students.  Although research interests of the Emory faculty cross  a number of specialties and use different approaches to  biological problems, they share a common interest in experimental  approaches to biological questions.  The goals of the program are  : (1) to provide an intensive research experience in one  subdiscipline; (2) to provide formal and informal introductions  to the processes of science; (3) to provide perspective by  examining alternative approaches to biological research at  different hierarchical levels; and (4) to maximize participant  interaction with other undergraduate and graduate researchers,  the research mentor, and his/her research group.  The program  will include the following components: (1) independent student  research projects; (2) research methods workshops; (3) \"On Being  a Scientist,\" a seminar series designed to assess different  approaches to biological questions; (4) departmental seminars and  journal clubs in research areas; and (5) a series of discussions  on scientific integrity.       This award will foster the continued education and training  of individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic  researchers in biology.",
