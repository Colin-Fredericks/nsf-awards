 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a project concerned with the  theory and  application of the Hardy-Littlewood circle method.  The investigator is pursuing an improved, detailed understanding  of the circle method both from the analytic viewpoint, through  estimates for mean values of  exponential sums, and from an  arithmetic viewpoint, through an understanding of the role played  by the trivial solutions of diophantine systems lying on special  subvarieties. The analytic viewpoint will be considered in  through further investigation and development of the proposer's  new method for estimating fractional moments of smooth Weyl sums  and through detailed investigations of low moments of exponential  sums. The arithmetic viewpoint will be considered by continuing  the investigator's research on the number of non-diagonal  solutions of systems of symmetric diagonal  equations using  slicing methods and also perhaps by sieve methods. The latter  viewpoint will also be pursued through the testing of the \"Quasi-  Hardy-Littlewood\" model suggested recently by Vaughan and Wooley.    This research falls into the general mathematical field of  Number Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the  study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those  dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It  is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for  many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the  last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse   applications in areas such as data transmission and processing,  and  communication systems.",
