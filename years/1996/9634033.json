 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the period 1968-1974, certain American scientists challenged the existing relationship between science and the state.  In raising ethical questions concerning the funding of research for military projects and those of questionable social value, from the development of hi-tech weaponry to debates over genetic engineering, these scientists viewed science as an inherently political activity.  This dissertation research examines the experiences and motivations of the `radical` scientists who held this worldview as well as those factors -- religious, intellectual, and political -- that contributed to the emergence of a radical science movement.  Using various nonviolent strategies to affect change within the existing establishment of American science, these scientists sought to reformulate the ideology and ethos of science and its institutions.  This research will explore the historical context of the movement to probe important ethical issues involved in the radical scientists' critique of the existing scientific establishment and its relations to government, industry, and society, and in the radical scientists' perception of and interaction with contemporary social movements.  By investigating this heretofore overlooked aspect of American radicalism, the study will contribute to a richer understanding of how these scientists introduced a new vision of the ethical relation of science to society that continues to shape debates concerning science and values today.",
