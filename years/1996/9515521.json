This proposal requests supplemental  funds for travel to Taiwan to work with Taiwan oceanographers to collect samples to  determine iodine concentrations and their relationship with the dynamics of  the nitrogen  system in the East China Sea.  The Taiwan  National Science Council is providing the ship  support.  The primary research support for Dr. Wong is from a grant from  the Chemical  Oceanography Program (OCE-9301298), which  provides the cost for laboratory analyses. The  East China  Sea is a region with little hydrographic and process-  oriented data.  His  study may provide important data to address the question of why total iodine behaves  conservatively in the South Atlantic Bight but non- conservatively in the southeast China  Sea and whether iodine can be used as a tracer to understand the mixing process in  the  East China Sea.  The project is jointly supported by the  Taiwan National Science Council  and the NSF.",
