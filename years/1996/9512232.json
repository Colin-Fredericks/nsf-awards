 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the PhysicalChemistry program of the Chemistry   Division, Professor Greg O. Sitz of the Chemistry Department of the   University of Texas at Austin will perform a series of gas-surface   scattering experiments.  A combination of molecular beam and laser based   state preparation and detection techniques will be used to performm fully   quantum state resolved studies of gas-surface interaction dynamics.  The   scattering and dissociation of molecular hydrogen and deuterium from   single crystal copper surfaces  will be studied to determine the relative   importance of translational, rotational, vibrational and molecular   alignment in dermining the outcome of the scattering event.  Stimulated   Raman scattering will be used to prepare hydrogen molecules incident on   the copper surface in a selected rotational state of the first excited   vibrational state.  Scattered molecules will be detected in a quantum   state specific manner by multiphoton ionization.  The initial encounter of a molecule with a solid surface can lead to   several possible results depending on the molecule , the surface, and the   energy partitioning amongst the many available degrees of freedom.  These   possibilities include inelastic scattering, trapping, sticking and bond   breaking.  In the last case, a bond in the molecule can be broken, paying   the energy price by forming one or more chemical bonds to the surface.    This is the essence of the ability of many surfaces to promote or   participate in chemical reactions. In many cases of interest, however,   even though the reaction is energetically favorable, the reaction   probability is low because of the presence of a barrier: the reaction is   said to be activated.  Of central concern is the nature of this   activation barrier and the dynamical mechanism for crossing it.  This   research focuses on gas-surface interactions in systems where   dissociative adsorption is an activated process.  By performing this   research with fully state resolved measurements new insight into surface   dynamics will be gained and existing theories will be stringently tested.",
