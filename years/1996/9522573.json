It will also provide a unique opportunity for cross-disciplinary exchange of research. The conference has received endorsements from the Mathematical Programming Society and the Institute for Operations Research and Management Science, and is being held in cooperation with the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.  Networks are pervasive in modern life, whether real, as in the case of highways, pipelines, electrical systems, etc., or more abstract network models which represent interconnections among components of a complex system.  Advances in data structures and computer technology and the development of new algorithms have made it possible to solve classes of netwo rk optimization problems that were formerly intractable. Among these are problems in airline scheduling, transportation planning, satellite communications, water resource allocation, environmental modeling and VLSI chip design.  Papers presented at this conference will represent the state-of-the-art in network modeling and solution techniques. A selection of these papers will be placed in the public domain by the publication of special issues of refereed scholarly journals. ***                                   Oh     +'  0                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               $       H       l                                               D       h                                                   R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT                                       lagnese                             lagnese                     @    Wzp                            @     J#                            @      G                                                                                                    @    ^                                      Microsoft Word 6.0                                                      2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      e =       e               ?                       ?                                       j       j   j       j       j       j       ?
