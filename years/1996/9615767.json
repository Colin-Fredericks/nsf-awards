The project is under the  direction of James W. Dufty, University of Florida and Shankar P. Das,  Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.  The investigators will study the  long-standing problem of describing glass formation and the properties of  glasses.  Their objectives are to identify qualitative mechanisms  responsible for very slow dynamics and to develop practical methods for  quantitative analysis.  They will limit their study to the idealized hard  sphere system in order to take advantage of recent developments which  permit accurate theoretical analyses of the dynamics in both dense fluid  and crystal phases, not available for any other atomic or molecular  systems.  These prototype studies will address some of the most basic  questions relevant to glass formation and their properties.  Glasses and  related composites play an essential role in the development of new  materials in a wide range of applications.         Scope:  This collaboration is driven by the research interests of two highly  competent investigators who have worked together on closely related  research for the past six years.  The unique approach they have developed  for solving a significant problem has excellent potential for scientific  breakthrough.  The support requested is primarily for travel and per diem.   Postdocs and graduate students involved in the program will be supported  by their respective institutions.    ***",
