 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Drs. Charlotte Beck and George Jones will conduct archaeological research at the Sunshine Locality located in the Great Basin in eastern Nevada. Prior archaeological and geological testing by the investigators has revealed a stratigraphically delineated Paleoindian record spanning as much as 1,000 years beginning by 10,700 years ago. Buried several meters below the Sunshine Wash is a thick stratigraphic section that preserves charcoal, pollen, plant macrofossils, bone and fossil shells as well as several discrete levels with humanly produced artifacts. The most recent test excavations at the site produced a number of significant finds, including a fluted point, indicative of the earliest cultures in the New World and an association of  another point type and other lithic artifacts with the remains of an extinct camel. During the 1996 field season, NSF and other funds will permit extensive stratigraphic testing to locate areas where remains  occur in primary contexts. This will serve a geological goal to increase understanding of the development of the Sunshine stream system which contains the materials. The work will also provide additional exposures for sampling datable materials and environmental specimens. It will provide essential information on the depositional processes within the wash as they relate to strata containing artifacts and extinct fauna. The work will also expand artifact and faunal samples to permit detailed study of the vertical and lateral distributions of each.  The Great Basin of the Western United States has yielded plentiful archaeological information which indicates that this semi-arid region was inhabited by the first hunting and gathering cultures which entered North America during the final period of the last glacial advance. Archaeologists are interested in how humans at technologically simple levels adapted to different environments and because of the difficulties posed by the varying arid and semi-arid Great Basin region, they have focused on Paleoindian adaptations there. While surface remains in the form of stone tools are common and widely distributed, very few buried sites have been located and because these latter preserve significantly more information than their exposed counterparts they are especially important research targets. The Sunshine Locality is unique in the superimposed artifact bearing stratigraphic layers it contains. The materials Beck and Jones have recovered to date appear to have been slightly transported by stream action. This suggests that an undisturbed site lies buried in the immediate region and the team hopes to locate this.  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide information of great interest to many archaeologists. It will shed light on how humans adapt to a harsh and varying environment and will serve to improve teaching and education at an undergraduate institution.",
