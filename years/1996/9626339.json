One phase involves methods for  generating parameters in families.  Given a random variable with  distribution and survival functions, there are a number of ways  to impose parameters, in some instances by taking a function of  the random variable, and in some cases by taking a function of  the distribution or survival function.  The following are some  examples: (1) Location and scale parameters; (2) Frailty and  resilience parameters; (3) Power parameter; (4) Convolution  parameter (for special families such as the gamma family); (5)  Geometric-extreme stable parameter.  The investigators study  order relations for these parametric families.  For example, for  which parametric families are the hazard functions ordered; for  which families is there a stochastic or convex ordering.  The  introduction of parameters and their characteristics and their  orderings is fundamental to an insight concerning how to extend  the results to multivariate distributions.    Although the normal distribution plays a central role in many  applications and in statistical theory, it does not serve as a  model for lifetime data arising in industrial applications such  as manufacturing data, materials data, reliability data, nor does  it serve as a model for survival analysis or risk analysis in the  health or environmental sciences.  This research focuses on how  to generate non-normal parametric families that will provide an  insight into behavior patterns and prediction for such data.  In  particular, the methods being developed serve to upgrade risk and  reliability analyses in engineering applications.  A second  stage in this research is the development of multivariate  versions that take account of dependencies among measurements.",
