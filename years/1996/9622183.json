 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9622183    The aim of the research project is to obtain an understanding of the heat transfer processes involved in high-heat-flux spray cooling, including conduction, convection, and phase change in the forms of evaporation and boiling.  Experimental investigation is the primary research technique.  Recent studies have shown that the heat transfer process in spray cooling is highly dependent on the spray characeristics and the surface conditions.  In order to obtain a successful model/correlation for he process, it is essential to have  a data matrix with variations in:  spray characteristics, fluid properties, surface conditions, and spray/surface orientation with respect to gravity.  The ability to measure the spray parameters is essential for a better understanding of the spray cooling process.  The research equipment requested is a Phase-Doppler/Anemometer (PDA) which is capable of measuring simultaneously the droplets diameters, velocities, and the number flux of a liquid spray in a non-intrusive manner.  The PDA measures these parameters using the light scattered by the droplets moving through a very small probe defined by two intersecting laser spray by characteristics.    There is no comparable equipment available at the University of Central Florida.  This research equipment will also be used by several other faculty members in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department who are conducting research in combustion and single-phase/two-phase fluid flow and heat transfer.  ***",
