 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Atmospheric Sciences Department is modernizing its McIDAS student laboratory  through acquisition of three new Pentium-based personal computers to upgrade the old McIDAS OS/2 PC-based network. Additional support equipment, in the form of a color laser printer and memory upgrades for a limited number of the old OS/2 PCs, is also being implemented to enable the department to fully exploit the future McIDAS OS/2 capabilities, to improve the data distribution system and for providing a processing base capable of hosting the intended improvements to the basic software as supplied by UNIDATA.  This new equipment is a vital tool in many of the classes wherein the students interpret and develop computer-based meteorological displays. The new OS/2-based PCs provide a workstation-like environment for expanded research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. The addition of these workstations to the laboratory frees older PCs for use by the introductory classes and laboratories, thus allowing the upper-class undergraduate students to concentrate their efforts on the new equipment.",
