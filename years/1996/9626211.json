 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleague use the technique of  shadowing to devise rigorous computational methods for chaotic  dynamical systems.  In particular, they develop algorithms for the  determination of periodic orbits and their Lyapunov exponents.  Given the significant role the stable and unstable manifolds of  periodic orbits play in determining the global dynamics, a method  to compute these manifolds reliably is developed.  Moreover, they  develop a method of establishing chaotic behavior just from finite  computed orbits and an algorithm for measuring sensitivity to  initial data, which is the hallmark of chaos.  All the  computational algorithms are developed in the context of  autonomous ordinary differential equations.    Despite the recent major advances in dynamical systems  theory, analysis of specific equations arising in applications  must still largely rely on numerical computations.  Therefore, it  is important to devise computational techniques whose reliability  can be verified.  Indispensability of rigor is particularly acute  in the numerical studies of chaotic systems, which naturally  amplify even small computational errors.  Chaotic systems possess,  in the mist of bewildering complexity, many unstable periodic  orbits.  The main goal of the project is to develop computational  methods for locating such periodic orbits and their associated  structures.  Periodic orbits of chaotic systems, although  unstable, are of practical significance in, for example, designing  flight paths for spacecraft.  The investigators are beginning to  cooperate with Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists on efficient  and reliable computations of suitable paths.",
