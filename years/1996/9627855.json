This complex deformation  boundary is active today, as evidenced by both shallow and  intermediate depth seismicity, and includes the Moroccan Rif and  Spanish Betic interplate mountain belts, which constitute the  Gibraltar Arc, and the Alboran Sea.  A number of competing models  have been suggested to explain the apparent coeval development of  these striking arcuate fold and thrust mountain belts and the  neighboring Alboran basin since the early Miocene.  Possible models  range from trapped microplates to subduction or delamination.   Combined digital seismic networks in Spain and Morocco  (installation of the latter was in part supported by NSF funding)  provide 49 stations for data analysis.  Precise earthquake location  and focal mechanism determination along with 3-D seismic velocity  and attenuation mapping will be used to discriminate among the  competing models of deformation.  ***",
