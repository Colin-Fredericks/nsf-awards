The opportunity to acquire  the stress data is provided by the international drilling program  planned at Cape Roberts, which is located along the margin  between the uplifted Transantarctic Mountains and the rifted  crust of the Victoria Land basin.  Information on the paleostress  history of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic rift-basin fill will be  obtained from the core and downhole logging of natural fractures  and faults.  To establish the contemporary stress state, the  cores will be examined for coring-induced stress fractures and  the borehole will be examined via downhole televiewer and  dipmeter for any wellbore breakouts and fractures reactivated by  the contemporary stress field.  The stress data will be analyzed  to address questions relevant to the paleo- and neotectonic  evolution of the Antarctic plate.  The results will contribute to  the resolution of outstanding questions such as the cause of the  anomalous aseismicity of the continent, the geometry of stresses  along the lithospheric boundary between the Transantarctic  Mountains and the West Antarctic rift system, and the evolution  of the Antarctic intraplate stress field and its relation to  rifting episodes associated with Gondwanaland breakup.  Contemporary stress data obtained from this program will be added  to the global stress data base, and will help to fill the current  void in the global stress coverage marked by the Antarctic plate.",
