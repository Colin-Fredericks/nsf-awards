 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630092  Howe    This research effort employs high-resolution analytical  electron microscopy to address several fundamental questions  concerning the interfacial structure and growth kinetics of  precipitate interfaces in metal alloys.  Specifically, the  diffusion fields (solute concentration profiles) surrounding  growth ledges on the faces of gamma precipitate plates and  the plate edges in an Al-Ag alloy are determined using the  high-resolution (0.14 nm image resolution), small-probe (0.5  nm diameter) capabilities of a field-emission transmission  electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive  X-ray spectrometer (EDS).  These data are compared with  concentration profiles obtained from theoretical models to  provide the first tests of these models.  The Gatan imaging  filter (GIF) on the same microscope is used in conjunction  with the 0.5 nm probe to obtain electron energy-loss spectra  (EELS) across the faces, edges and ledges of gamma hydride  plates in Ti-H alloys.  These data make it possible to  determine whether the titanium hydride structure is fully  formed at the transformation interface or whether the  compositional and structural changes may be decoupled in  this mixed-mode transformation. Such analyses should clarify  key fundamental questions related to the growth of  precipitate plates in metal alloys.  %%%  This experimental research provides theorists important  information on the concentration profiles in the vicinity of  ledges on the faces of growing precipitate plates during  early stages of growth. Ti-H alloy research explores the  question of whether shear of Ti permits the titanium  hydride, TiH, to grow.  The mechanism of growth is obscure  at the present time, but the hydride is an undesirable phase  in titanium alloys.  ***",
