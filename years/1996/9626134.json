 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9626134  Tsay    This research involves two main topics in data analysis for  processing   information and making inference. The first main topic is  Bayesian   modeling of multivariate time series. The research seeks to  develop  a unified modeling approach for a wide variety of vector models.   In   particular, the investigator proposes a nice method for  simultaneous   dentification of Kronecker indexes and parameters of a vector  process,   and considers common features such as common trends,   common business cycles, and common nonlinearity in a large  system.   For co-integrated series, the method identifies the number   of common trends  at the stage of  model specification and,  hence,   differs from the existing methods that  test co-integration rank  under   a given model. The research employs Gibbs sampler in estimation;  it uses   closed-form conditional posterior distributions for linear  parameters, but   augments the sampler with other Markov chain methods such as the   Hasting-Metropolis algorithm and the griddy Gibbs to handle  nonlinear   parameters. The second topic is model uncertainty via data  perturbation   in time series analysis. The research relaxes the commonly  imposed   assumption of existence of a model and uses data perturbation to  investigate   model uncertainty. The investigator uses single and simultaneous   data-perturbation to study the impact of model uncertainty on  model selection,   parameter inference, and prediction. Based on the  Kullback-Leibler   measure, the research  produces a selection criterion that has  three components,   namely \"goodness of fit,\" \"complexity penalty,\" and  \"uncertainty  measure.\"    This result differs from most of the existing selection criteria  that only contain   the first two components. Furthermore, the research shows that  the impact of   \"uncertainty measure\"is most pronounced when the sample size is  small.   %%%  This research involves two topics in the analysis of a large  system   for  processing information a nd making informed decisions The  results obtained   are widely applicable in many scientific fields. For example,  they can be used in   stochastic process control in manufacturing, to monitor  simultaneously air   pollution indices at several locations in an environmental study,  to study common   business cycles in  macro-economics, and to study common  seasonality and trends   in ozone concentrations.  The research also seeks efficient  computational methods   to perform high dimensional optimization for statistical  estimation. The first topic   of the research is analysis of multiple processes in which the  investigator develops   a unified modeling approach that can identify the complete  dynamic structure   of a large system. The structure may contain important common  characteristics   such as common trends, common business cycles, and common  nonlinearity.   When common trends are present, the method identifies the number   of common trends  simultaneously with other relationships between  the processes.     The second topic of the research is the role of model uncertainty  in statistical inference.    The inference may be prediction, trend estimation, or assessing  the effects of a change   in an input variable on the output variables.    ***",
