The workshop organizers  are Professor Abhay Ashtekar and Post-doc Jorge Pullin of the  Center for Gravitational Physics and Geometry, Penn State  University, and J.V. Narlikar, Director of IUCAA.  This workshop  will take advantage of India's distinguished tradition in general  relativity as well as their significant investments in radio and  optical astronomy which recently have stimulated further research  in general relativity, astrophysics and cosmology.  Rapid progress  in the interface of general relativity with astrophysics, cosmology,  particle physics, quantum theory and certain branches of  mathematics has added to the number of directions of active  research.  The workshop will bring US participants together with  key Indian scientists working in gravitational physics with the aim  of developing collaborative links between research groups in the  US and India in well-defined areas of gravitational physics.  Scope:  The event will be hosted by the IUCAA and is supported  by the Department of Science and Technology.  US scientists will  have a unique opportunity to gain direct knowledge about the  research being carried out by first-rate Indian scientists and to meet  next generation leaders.  Considering the calibre of young Indian  scientists now working in this field, there is a high probability that  even more important contributions will arise from collaborative  efforts with the US scientists.   ***",
