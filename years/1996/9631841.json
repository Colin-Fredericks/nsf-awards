 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an attempt to address the paucity of  young women going into technical careers,  this Model Project seeks to  encourage enrollment and performance in science and  math for middle school girls; to improve the quality of instruction in middle school  science;  and, by establishing a support network of students, teachers and parents, to  encourage girls to pursue technical careers.   Half of the participants will come from  urban  schools, while the other half will be from rural ones.  Classroom teachers  from the students  schools, as well as university faculty, will work with the girls.   They will be assisted by students who had participated in previous institutional  programs.  There will be special resources and assistance available to the teachers to  enable them to enhance their own classroom instruction.  This project  will build upon  and  significantly expand a prior program.      The Young Women s Technical Institute will be comprised of a three week summer  program combined with  activities during the school year  involving students, teachers  and parents .  These include student research project presentations, career discussions  with professionals, special seminars and field trips.  Year round mentoring is planned.   The New York State Framework for Mathematics, Science and Technology will be  utilized in the project s curriculum planning.  Activities will be in the areas of  physics, chemistry, mechanical and electrical engineering, astronomy, space science,  geology, and computer science.  The approach will be to help students to understand  the basic science behind the projects with which they are having fun through a hands-  on learning experience.",
