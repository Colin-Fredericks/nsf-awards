 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adrian/Abstract           Experimental studies of turbulent fluid flow will be conducted  in wide fluid layers that model many fundamental aspects of the  atmospheric boundary layer.  Turbulent motions in these layers are  caused by buoyant heating of the lower surface, which is typically  horizontal.  The purposes of the experiments are to understand how  turbulent flows are organized from characteristic coherent  structures such as thermals and plumes,and to determine how details  of the surface geometry and heat patterns affect these structures  and the macroscopic mean phenomena such as heat transport, humidity  transport and transport of pollutants.  To this end experiments  will be conducted over three types of surfaces:  smooth, rough and  inhomogeneous, with primary emphasis on  the latter.  The  inhomogeneous surface have patterns of heating or elevation that  are on a scale comparable to the layer depth.         High resolution particle image velocimeter techniques will be  used to measure instantaneous velocity vector field in flow, and  laser induced fluorescence will be used to measure instantaneous  temperature fields.  New techniques will be developed to measure  the three dimensional structure of the scalar fields of temperature  and concentration and velocity vector fields.  From the  measurements patterns of motion will be educed by direct inspection  and by statistical methods such as spatial correlation techniques,  stochastic estimation and proper orthogonal decomposition.  Basic  properties of the fields such as distribution of turbulent kinetic  energy, transport of various moments and dissipation will be  measured.  In the case of homogeneous surfaces, the statistical  axisymmetry about the vertical will allow complete determination of  the two-point spatial correlation function, from which accurate  measurement of the viscous dissipation will be possible.         The rough surface study will concentrate on sinusoidal surface  shapes, while the inhomogeneous study will co nsider variety of  inhomogeneous heating patterns such as a step function, a  monolithic square, and a checkerboard.  The information obtained  will be useful in testing and developing large eddy simulations.",
