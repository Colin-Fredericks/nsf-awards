 "awd_abstract_narration": "Furman University is currently revising its curriculum to reflect the earth systems approach suggested by the NASA advisory council. As the earth systems approach involves the teaching of sophisticated geochemical concepts, it is necessary to incorporate analytical instrumentation, the process of geochemical analysis, and data interpretation into each of the classes. This project focuses on developing an integrated, problem-solving-based curriculum in which the sophistication of geochemical concepts and participation in sample analysis will increase as the student moves through the curriculum. Current research in pedagogy indicates that (1) problem solving increases learning retention and critical thinking ability and (2) active participation in a cooperative learning environment will attract women and minorities into the sciences. Therefore, the acquisition of a new, fully automated x-ray fluorescence (XRF) unit will have a major impact on the Earth and Environmental Sciences Department by allowing students to discover geochemical principles through integrated field and laboratory exercises and research projects.    At the introductory level, students are being introduced to geochemical analysis through demonstration of sample preparation and analysis, followed by interpretation of a data set from rocks seen on previous field trips. At the advanced level, the presence of an XRF unit in the department enables faculty to give increasingly more responsibility for sample preparation and analysis to the students as they progress through the major. Data collected by the students can be used to illustrate the partitioning of elements in the Earth's crust by geologic processes such as magma crystallization and weathering. The XRF unit can be used in nearly all courses for majors including earth materials, advanced earth materials, sedimentary geology, ore deposits, and a field-based course in geochemistry. As active, participatory learning is important to the curriculum, all students participate in res earch projects throughout their career, finishing with an independent research project. The XRF unit enables students involved in geochemical research to be involved in the process of research beyond data interpretation.",
