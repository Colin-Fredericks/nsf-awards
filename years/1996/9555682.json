An overarching theme in this ScienceSpace research is to  develop a theory of how multisensory \"immersion\" aids learning.  These virtual worlds can simultaneously provide learners with 3-D  representations; multiple perspectives/frames of reference; a  multimodal interface; simultaneous visual, auditory, and haptic  feedback; and types of interaction unavailable in the real world  (e.g.,seeing through objects, flying like superman). With careful  design, these capabilities all can synthesize to create a profound  sense of motivation and concentration conducive to mastering  complex, abstract material. Studying this new type of learning  experience to chart its strengths and its limits is an important  frontier for cognitive science research and constructivist  pedagogy.    All ScienceSpace virtual worlds are built using a polygonal  geometry. Colored, shaded polygons and textures are used to produce  detailed objects. These objects are linked together and given  behaviors through the use of NASA-developed software that defines  the virtual worlds; connects them to underlying physical  simulations; and handles graphics rendering, collision detection,  and lighting models. Interactivity is achieved through the linkage  of external devices (e.g., head-mounted display, 3-D mouse).    The investigators have developed extensive assessment methodologies  and instruments, literally hundreds of pages in length, for  studying how and what users learn in the worlds we have created.   Researchers are videotaping the hours of time spent with each  subject, then studying these records for additional insights. This  careful evaluation strategy is generating detailed data from which  a comprehensive picture is being constructed of how multisensory  immersion can enhance learning, as well as how virtual reality's  usability can be enhanced. In addition,  the strategies underlying  these assessment methodologies and instruments are generalizable to  a wide range of synthetic environments and virtual worlds.    This project makes a significant contribution to knowledge and  learning for at least three reasons:   *    the next step in the evolution of constructivist pedagogy is  the usage of multisensory in synthetic environments  *    virtual reality interfaces provide a unique testbed for  transferring to educational settings capabilities from data  visualization, sonification, etc.; and  *    learning through multisensory immersion could leverage a huge  installed base of videogame technology as a means for the delivery  of education outside of school settings.  ***",
