 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601818  Liou         This grant will establish a simulation and testing facility  for motion control and power electronic technology.  It will  support:     *    One HP Engineering Workstation with peripheral devices to  run SABER system simulation software;  *    A three-year SABER system simulation software maintenance   agreement;  *    Three Yokogawa high bandwidth, three-phase power analyzers  to measure voltage, current, and power of tested power  converter or machine;  *    One four-quadrant Dynamometer for loading of rotating  machine under test (MUT);  *    Two LeCroy high sampling frequency digital oscilloscopes for   data acquisition of experimental results;  *    Two digital signal processor (DSP)-based developmental  systems for implementing various control algorithms in  motion control applications;  *    Voltage and current transducers for measuring and isolating   experimental voltage and current signals.         Existing research in this PI focuses on the rotating machines used in various motion control applications, especially squirrel cage induction SCI machines and switched reluctance machines (SRM).        The new instrumentation will increase the capability and  efficiency of is research efforts and enable him to train more  graduate students.  With the proposed SABER system simulator,  design mistakes can be found and corrected easily by conducting  simulation runs before building a prototype in the laboratory.  A  four-quadrant dynamometer will provide all kinds of load profiles  for a machine under test.  Accurate data collection is vital in  verification of efficiency and performance improvements made  possible by innovations.  High bandwidth voltage, current, and  power meters and digital oscilloscopes can enable him to conduct  experiments on the prototypes with both accuracy and ease.  Since  there is no such motion control testing facility available for the general research community in the San Francisco Bay, he also plans to reorganize short courses using this pro posed facility for professional enhancement of motion control engineers and  engineering faculty.  ***  ??",
