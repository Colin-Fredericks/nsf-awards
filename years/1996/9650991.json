 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is to give a complete, better and real learning experience for the undergraduate students in the organic chemistry curriculum by added instrumentation and computer modeling. Recipe approach to organic synthesis will be transformed into a discovery approach by the addition of FT-IR spectrometer, requested through this proposal. The project integrates theory, computer modeling and FT-IR spectroscopy to give the students a collaborative, mini-corporate world experience. Students use FT-IR spectroscopy to follow chemical reactions, identify isomeric mixtures and for structural elucidation of products of chemical reaction. The theory of IR spectroscopy they learn comes alive by their personal handling of the IR spectrometer in the organic laboratory. Students as a team use SIPDE-SPARC approach to design and carry out their own synthesis; they use FT-IR spectroscopy to learn about quality control and product development in collaboration with a local industry. The collaborative, autonomous nature of these projects aided by FT-IR spectrometer and computer modeling gives the students a glimpse of the real professional world and prepares them adequately with all the requites of the cyberspace/virtual reality age.",
