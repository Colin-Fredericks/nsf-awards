Research  activities are centered at MSRI, and Dr. Lynne M. Butler is on the  program committee for the workshop on enumeration and partially  ordered sets and is giving a series of lectures on this topic at  MSRI's introductory workshop.    Interactive activities engage her with postdoctoral researchers,  graduate students at the University of California - Berkeley, and  local high school teachers.  They include teaching a UC-Berkeley  graduate course in Coxeter groups, mentoring and supporting the  women mathematicians (undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral) in  Berkeley's Noetherian Ring, and experimenting with outreach to high  school teachers during MSRI's introductory workshop.",
