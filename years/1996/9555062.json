 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since its inception, the software industry has languished in  a perpetual state of crisis.  Academic computer science  departments have contributed to this by largely failing in  their responsibility to appropriately educate and prepare  software professionals. We propose to address this failure  with the following three-pronged effort:  A comprehensive  and integrated four-semester software-development curriculum  will be created and installed within the undergraduate  computer science programs at The Ohio State University and  at West Virginia University. Fundamental to this curriculum  is the guiding philosophy that software is properly  conceptualized and constructed in terms of carefully  engineered reusable software components. A software  composition workbench, consisting of an integrated set of  software tools, will be developed. The workbench will be  capable of guiding and supporting students and software  developers in their use and application of the methodologies  taught in the software development curriculum.  The proposed curriculum and workbench will be rigorously  evaluated through content-oriented, performance- oriented,  and attitude-oriented studies. Central to this effort will  be development of appropriate, longitudinal evaluation  instruments for each of the courses in the curriculum and  for the workbench.  The goal of this project is to create a  system capable of producing software professionals with  greater awareness and understanding of the technical issues  faced by the software industry, and with measurably better  software design and development skills.",
