 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514888     Becker      The gonadal steroid hormones have long been known to influence  female behaviors.  However, the mechanism by which these hormones  generate their behavioral effects is largely unknown.  There are  data that do not conform to the classical mechanism for steroid  hormone action, i.e. binding of hormone to intracellular receptors  and subsequently altering nuclear gene transcription.   Consequently, novel non-genomic effects have been postulated by  investigators, including Dr. Becker, to resolve the temporal  inconsistencies between the behavioral observations and the time  required to alter gene transcription.  The present research goes  beyond this level to explore the non-genomic effects of the steroid  hormones in specific brain regions and investigates the ability of  steroid hormones to influence dopaminergic neuronal activity in the  striatum and accumbens, and how this classical neurotransmitter  acts in these areas to modulate female behavior.  Moreover, other  investigator have shown a strong interaction between striatal  dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid in controlling movement.   Logically, Dr. Becker will investigate how estrogen alters the  activity of the neurons containing these neurotransmitters and the  direct consequences on female behavior which is dependent on  movement.  These studies are exciting and highly innovative.  They  will revolutionize the thinking about female behaviors and the  components required for their generation.  Investigating the  interaction of dopamine-and gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing  neurons in the striatum may open new avenues for understanding  presynaptic regulatory mechanisms in the brain, which will impact  not only the neuroendocrinology field, but may also reveal more  about the behavior of animals in their natural habitats and the  critical cues that trigger female behaviors.",
