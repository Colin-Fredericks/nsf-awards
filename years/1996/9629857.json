 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Division of Chemistry supports the early stages of   development of the Princeton Environmental Institute: Research Initiative   in Science and Engineering.  Ten science and engineering departments will   participate in a joint effort to prepare science and engineering graduate   students for life-time careers of effective participation in   environmental problem-solving.  In addition to pursuing the usual   departmental research programs, students will engage in a supplemental   course of study and research addressing the environmental implications of   their research topic.  This educational effort is also expected to result   in a better alignment of faculty research programs with environmental   objectives.  Emphasis will be placed on improving information flows among   various disciplines and the development of interdisciplinary research   programs.  The program will be led by Dr. Thomas G. Spiro, Chemistry   Department, Princeton University, and Dr. Robert G. Socolow, Director of   the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies in the School of   Engineering.  Faculty from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and   International Affairs in the area of Science, Technology, and Public   Policy will staff courses on policy issues.  Students will have   opportunities for internships in industrial and other non-academic   settings.  Examples of case studies to be examined include: interplay of   stratospheric ozone chemistry with advanced engine design for supersonic   transport; metals cycling in the ocean; pollution management at   coal-fired power plants; dioxin transport in the biosphere; and dioxin   formation in combustion of chlorinated feedstocks.",
