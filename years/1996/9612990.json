 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this Technology for Sustainable Environment award, the Inorganic,   Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program, as part of the   NSF/EPA Partnership, is supporting the research and educational   activities of Dr. Terrence J. Collins of the Department of Chemistry at   Carnegie Mellon University. Professor Collins will focus his work on   developing new activators for oxidations associated with special purpose   bleaching and cleaning agents.  This is a collaborative effort with the   Clorox Company, a major US corporation specializing in the laundry   additive business. The activators of interest show high reactivity,   longevity, aqueous solubility and stability. Studies will be focused on   investigating the mechanism of oxidation and changes associated with   variations in reaction conditions.   The studies performed under this award will provide a basis for the   design of environmentally benign and highly stable activators for   eventual use in the bleaching industry.  Industries associated with   bleaching technologies are multibillion dollar global activities. The   widespread use of these activators could substantially reduce the   quantities of oxidants currently in use.",
