 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will design an Environmental Geology laboratory  course that addresses urban and suburban problems in a scientific  manner. Exercises designed for this course will be practical,  based on a problems that that could be encountered in a variety of  urban settings, with solutions derived through quantitative  analysis of datasets on the computer. Students will be asked to  evaluate or design remediation methods for a number of  environmental problems. Several instruments will be designed and  built for this project. Northern New Jersey is the ideal area to  develop such a course because it is largely urban or suburban,  because it contains many severe environmental hazards at all  scales, and because New Jersey spends more per capita on  environmental clean up than any other state in the union. The  Rutgers-Newark campus contains a culturally and ethnically diverse  student body that is largely from this highly populated area;  urban environmental geology issues will have particular relevance  for this student clientele, and will help to recruit minority  participation in geoscience education.",
