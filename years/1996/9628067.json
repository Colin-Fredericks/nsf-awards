 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal seeks to use fractal or self-similar models to  describe the long-range correlations observed in measurements of traffic  from actual networks, and apply techniques to deal with fractal models,  well-known in physics but hardly ever used in the area of network  performance analysis, to obtain relevant insight into the performance of  modern high-speed networks for their design, management, and control.    The research seeks to quantify the impact of fractal traffic  characteristics on network performance, building on the present experience  with self-similar traffic models.  First, the work will extend the  understanding of simple single-server models achieved by the PIs and other  authors.  The effects of complications such as multiple service classes and  finite buffer sizes, and the modifications needed when self similarity is  only asymptotic (relevant for variable-bit-rate services) will be  considered.  Second, the effects of connecting a large number of nodes in a  network will be investigated including issues such as the robustness of  self similarity.  Finally, the project will tackle the difficult problems  of understanding the transformations induced on self similar traffic by  network controls as well as the consequences of self similarity on the  effectiveness of the controls themselves.    The work will consist of constructing simple models for networks, testing  their validity through numerical simulations, and comparing their behavior  with experimental measurements from real networks.   The behavior of these  models will be studied through a combination of numerical and analytical  techniques.",
