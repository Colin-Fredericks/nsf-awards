 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deployment of wireless, mobile networks is rapidly increasing as advances  in digital cellular systems promise large-scale, reliable voice, data, and  multimedia communications in a mobile environment.  The realization of  Personal Communications Services (PCS) will increase dependence on mobile  networks by the mass public and private sectors, implying that system  failure resulting in loss of communication or critical data will not be  tolerated.  Fault tolerance analysis provides an understanding of system  functionality in the wake of failures.    Fault tolerance analysis such as the reliability, availability, and  survivability problems continues to be well researched for wired networks.  The mobility of the user along with the unpredictability of motion indicate  that models and assumptions for wired networks cannot be carried over to  the wireless, mobile domain.  Very little focus has yet been placed on  fault tolerance analysis for mobile networks in particular.    This project fills this void through exploratory research on fault  tolerance analysis of systems which provide large-scale PCS, including  voice, data and multimedia communications.  These systems are comprised of  radio frequency communications within mobile cellular or picocellular  networks that are interconnected to the existing (wired) infrastructure.  The fault tolerance criteria and evaluation approach are not immediately  apparent for these systems due to the heterogeneity of the services  provided and of the underlying interconnection network, and due to the  inherent unreliability of the wireless communications medium.  The goal of  this project is to formulate the appropriate research problems regarding  fault tolerance of mobile systems and to indicate an analysis strategy.  This includes identifying fault tolerance parameters (or propose new ones)  which are most useful to measuring system robustness, developing a network  modeling approach (or set of approaches), and proposing preliminary fault  tolerance algor ithms using these models.",
