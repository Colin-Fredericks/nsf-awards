Biodegradable microparticles are being studied for use in a  wide variety of drugs as a means to deliver the drug in the  body in a controlled manner. A significant obstacle to the  use of microparticles is their tendency to settle quickly in  commonly used injection carrier materials such as saline.  The settling makes it difficult to administer the entire  injection volume of microparticles, and also the  microparticles have a tendency to clump in the needle of the  syringe, when injection becomes impossible.    This Phase II investigation involves the development of  technologies by which biodegradable microparticles  containing drugs would be surface treated so they remain  suspended in aqueous media for long periods. As a result of  studies conducted in the Phase I investigation, the Phase II  study will focus  the direction of the surface treatment so  as to produce the greatest results with the least pote",
