 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past academic year, fourteen faculty from the  sciences, mathematics and education departments at SUNY  Cortland participated in an NSF Development Grant.  During  this project, course outlines were developed for a  restructured math/science/pedigogy/composition program for K-  6 pre-teachers, SUNY Cortland has the largest elementary  teacher preparation program in the State of New York.  The  proposed project would develop the curriculum and  instructional materials to implement a 27 cr. hr, block of  experiences. in addition to the fourteen SUNY Cortland  staff, science/math faculty from five regional Community  colleges would be involved in the curriculum development and  implementation phases of the proposed project, A  research/assessment team from Cornell University would  evaluate all aspects of the project.  The Level One block  contains content courses specifically designed for the K-6  pre-teachers and will be taught utilizing a conceptual  change approach, Composition 101 will be taught in  conjunction with the Level One Science course.  Pedagogy  courses in both science and math will be taught in  conjunction with the Level One content courses.  In both  pedagogy courses, the pre-teachers will be involved in  experiences with elementary school-aged students.  The Level  Two block is an integrated and interdisciplinary  math/science experience in which students will be introduced  to problem solving strategies and will utilize the  strategies to investigate six significant real world science  problems, The mathematical concepts will be developed  through the context of science content, During the Level Two  block, pre-teachers will work with elementary-aged children  in a math/science lab setting.  In a culminating  math/science experience, the pre-teachers will participate  in a Science, Technology and Society (STS) block in which  they will be engaged in conducing real world STS research  under the guidance of a faculty facilitator and a  business/industry mentor.  Each c urricular block will be  pilot tested three times before the curriculum is integrated  Into the academic program of the host institution and that  of the five satellite campuses.",
