The correlation between residence in a very poor  neighborhood and negative labor market outcomes is very strong.   The question is to what extent these labor market outcomes are  the result of low skills and low motivation of individuals alone  as distinct from neighborhood effects.  The Gatreaux housing  program moved similar families to a variety of neighborhoods in a  quasi-random manner, therefore the labor market experiences of  the individuals in these families can be used to separate  individual effects from neighborhood effects.",
