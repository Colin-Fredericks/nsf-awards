 "awd_abstract_narration": "While computers have revolutionized introductory mathematics and statistics courses, students often find that more advanced courses do not take full advantage of the new approaches and training that they have received. However, powerful and user-friendly software for visualizing complex geometric relations and for typesetting mathematical documents is now available to be used effectively in middle- and upper-level undergraduate courses.   The objective of this project is to prepare mathematics majors to address large problems_such as understanding the motion of a drum_using computers. Computer graphics help students visualize a problem, and mathematical typesetting tools allow them to synthesize their understanding by writing documents that incorporate text, graphics, and mathematical formulations. This project concentrates on three intermediate- and advanced-level courses in the calculus sequence and three more in statistics. The department is developing modules for class discussion and exploration using computers and disseminating them through the Web site and the FTP site maintained by the mathematics department, as well as through presentations to meetings of the Mathematical Association of America and the American Statistical Association.",
