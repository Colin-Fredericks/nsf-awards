 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA diagnostics are taught in the context of many fields within the Biology Program, but reinforcement in the laboratory has lagged. The major goal of this project is to incorporate into Cell Biology and Genetics a cohesive series of DNA analysis laboratories. Together, these courses serve 150 biology majors in the liberal arts or secondary science education each year. The laboratories being developed demonstrate the utility of DNA as a molecular marker, provide our students with earlier and more individual hands-on experience in a variety of techniques, and relate to interesting issues in human disease. A new facility is being established with six stations to do DNA restriction endonuclease mapping, a thermal cycler to amplify DNA by PCR, a freezer, two microcentrifuges, and a photographic recording system for gels. A novel feature is the establishment of a network of three personal computers for data acquisition and analysis. Students access and discuss human genetic disease information found on CancerNet and OMIN on the Internet.   With its focus on human genetic diseases, the material in the new series of laboratories may be more relevant and especially useful to secondary science education majors as a classroom resource. Supplemental use of the facility can be arranged for select laboratories in electives, for student research, and for a laboratory component added to a nonmajors course in Human Genetics.    One way in which information in the facility can be disseminated is through the Internet World Wide Web page set up for the students, the teacher graduates, and other local area teachers, to whom the depatment can provide occasional workshops.",
