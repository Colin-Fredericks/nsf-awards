Rajagopal of the University of Pittsburgh and Jan Kratochvil of the Czech Technical University is to develop a unified theory and coherent model that can explain a range of inelastic phenomena in solid materials.  Specifically, the researchers intend to address the details of microstructure and their impact on the evolution of mechanical properties in a body, which may possess more than one stress-free configuration.  In the process, the researchers plan to incorporate in this theory their experimental observations concerning: 1) dislocation structures and non-local effects due to such dislocation structures; 2) \"fading memory\" for stress based on a \"path length\" measure in strain space; and 3) maximized dissipation.   Their findings should contribute to our understanding of the basic physical properties of mechanics and yield results that can benefit current technology where inelasticity in materials such as metals or polymers presents persistent manufacturing and infrastructural problems.    This mechanical engineering research project fulfills the program of objective of advancing basic scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of mutual interest and competence.           ??",
