Modeling and simulation of intermetallic growth at the solder/substrate interface is carried out by using DICTRA and newly-developed THERMO-CALC softwares.  The study is conducted to improve the mechanical, thermo-mechanical, and electrical properties of low and higher melting temperatupe lead-free solders and solder joints; hence, the focus is on three areas:  (1) design of hierarchical high temperature (260 to 310(C) lead free solders; (2) dynamical microstructural evolution and its effect on the properties of solders and solder joints; and 3) design of fluxes aimed at improving the solderability of the lead-free solders.  Powders of Cu-Ni-Al and Ni-Ti alloys that exhibit pseudoelastic behavior are dispersed into selected lead-free solders.  The investigation of properties are measured as a function of solid-state aging for bulk solders and solder joints and the microstructural parameters are quantitized.   %%% This project is important to gaini ng increased fundamental understanding of physical, electrical, and  chemical properties of lead-free solders and solder joints. The result of this investigation of  the alloy design and development at high temperature lead free solders is expected to contribute significantly to the environmental and health concerning new electronic package technology.   ***                          ;                                                                 O  h    +'  0                                                               &       2       >     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               F       N       Z       w                                               @   Macintosh HD:Applications:Microsoft Word 6.0.1:Templates:Normal         9523447         jyu         Bruce MacDonald      '@    \"\" ^b  @     v     @     xgb                   @                   Microsoft Word 6.0.1                 6                                  ;                                                                                                                                                                       h O       e                                                                               j       j   j       j       j       j       j                                                                           1                                                                                                                       &   *   X       -                           j                                                                                          j       j                                                                       j               j                                       ~               j       j       j       j                           )                                                                                                 9523447 Fine  Fundamental aspects of alloy design, microstructural evolution, and solderability are addressed in this lead-free solders research project.
