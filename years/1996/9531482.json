Interface roughness is a central  issue in thin film deposition and directly controls many physical  and  chemical  properties of the films. The  goals  are  to  grow  amorphous  films and test unambiguously the validity  of  various  proposed   mechanisms  based  on  noise  induced   growth   front  roughening.  Differentiation of various roughness mechanisms in a  molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth front will be carried out  as  will   the  development  of  real  time  diffraction  techniques,  especially light scattering for quantitative measurement of rough  surface growth in a hostile deposition environment.  %%%  This research will support the investigation of the formation  of  interface  roughness  during  growth/etching  of  surfaces  under  conditions far from equilibrium.
