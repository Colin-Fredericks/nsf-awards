In  particular, emphasis is on the nonequilibrium dynamics of  granular materials and of collective motion in driven  disordered systems such as flux lattices in type-II  superconductors and sliding charge density waves.  Recent  experimental work on these systems has revealed rich  dynamical behavior that may be amenable to detailed  theoretical understanding.  The research goal is to  understand both the deterministic and noisy response of  these systems and to identify unifying physical principles  that may be applicable to a broad range of complex systems.  %%%  This new award focuses on the theory of the dynamical  properties of inhomogeneous condensed matter systems.
