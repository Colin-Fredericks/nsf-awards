The conference will be held 9-13 September 1996 on the campus of the  University of Reading.  Endorsement and co-sponsorship for this meeting has also  been obtained from the World Meteorological Organization's Commission on  Atmospheric Sciences.  The conference will host sessions on a number of  phenomena and research programs of interest internationally, including mesoscale  aspects of fronts and frontal cyclones (with emphasis on the upcoming joint U.S.-  European Fronts and Atlantic Storm Tracks Experiment), orographic flows and  gravity waves (including work relevant to planning for the Mesoscale Alpine Project,  tropical convection (the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean -  Atmosphere Response Experiment), and related modeling and forecasting activities.        The setting on the campus of the University of Reading will not only allow  for desirable reduction of per diem costs, but also affords ready access to such  notable facilities as the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting,  the United Kingdom Meteorological Office, and Oxford University.  Support  provided under this proposal will be distributed to a limited number (approximately  12-15) graduate students or beginning post-docs who meet the following eligibility  requirements: (1) is a U.S. citizen, (2) has a paper accepted for oral or orally-  introduced poster presentation at the Conference, and (3) agrees to cost share their  travel costs.  The selection process and actual distribution of funds will be  administered by the executive office of the American Meteorological Society.  ***",
