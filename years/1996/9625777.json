Nonparametric counterparts of such commonly   used linear model ideas as regression  coefficients, correlation coefficients,   coefficient of determination,  and principal components are considered.    The research also studies nonparametric techniques for model diagnostics  that can be used for dimensionality reduction and to address the   question of adequacy of particular models.  Both asymptotic and finite sample   properties are studied, and the problem of developing reliable   data-based methods for smoothing parameter selection for functionals and   curves is addressed.   %%%       With the advent of computer data bases of unprecedented size and  complexity and with the dramatic increase in computer power, it has   become increasingly more desirable and possible to develop more flexible   models, concepts, and procedures that can be used to study relationships   between variables and to construct models without relying on rigid global   assumptions.  Much of  the recent work in statistics have addressed this   need for more general and flexible methods.  This research  further extends this work with a special focus on procedures that are   counterparts of many commonly used linear model concepts and that expose   important features in the data using intuitive and familiar ideas.  ***",
