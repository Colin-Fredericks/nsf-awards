Laminated  beams have been observed to fail through several mechanisms,  including  yielding  of  the  laminate,  crushing   of   the  concrete, and brittle fracture through delamination  of  the  composite from the concrete.  Available experience has shown  that fracture through delamination can occur at stress below  material limits and under loads within normal service.   The  emphasis  of  this  study will be on  delamination  and  its  causes,  specifically in the presence of  combined  flexural  and shear cracks in the retrofitted concrete beam.  Fracture  mechanics based combined experimental and numerical  studies  of  failure  initiating  from the concrete-adherent-laminate  interface  region  will  be  performed  on  concrete   beams  laminated   with   fiber-reinforced  plastics.    Parametric  investigations    involving    different    materials    and  construction   techniques   will   determine   the   optimum  effectiveness of these combinations.  The project will  have  the   collaboration  of  Swiss  Federal   Laboratories   for  Materials  Testing and Research (EMPA) in Switzerland  where  large   scale  tests  will  be  conducted  with   consistent  parameters as will be used in this study.  This research  is  expected   to  provide  a  fundamental  knowledge   of   FRP  delamination, and be developing the needed design guidelines  to  have a direct impact on engineering application  in  the  retrofitting  field  in an efficient, economical,  and  safe  manner.  ***",
