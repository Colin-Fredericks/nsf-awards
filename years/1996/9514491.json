Informal arguments take place when  individuals exchange views on belief about an assertion or a  possible action.  For example, debates between friends or family  members, classroom sparring about an idea, scientific exchanges  about empirical results or theories, and negotiations in business  are all informal arguments.  This research will develop a theory  of these arguments in terms of the conversational moves that  participants can make within them, for example, asking for a  justification, giving a reason, offering an objection, or  conceding a point.  This theory will determine to which of the  argument's claims each participant is committed publicly at any  stage of the argument and will identify changes in commitment as  the argument unfolds.    Three groups of experiments will assess and refine the theory.   The first group will test predictions about people's memory for  arguments and understanding of them.  In these experiments,  people will read a series of naturalistic dialogues between two  characters and will then judge which of the dialogues' claims  each of the characters accepts.  The theory's predictions about  changes in the characters' commitments as the dialogue proceeds  will be compared to the people's judgments.  The theory also  predicts that arguments vary in the demands they make on  participants' and overhearers' memory, since some arguments  require participants to keep track of claims in order to return  to them later.    The second set of experiments will examine people's judgments  about burden of proof.  In this context, burden of proof is the  responsibility a participant has to support his or her case.  The  theory predicts that which participant has the greater burden of  proof depends, among other factors, on the number of claims that  are currently under dispute and the strength of support for these  claims.  The experiments will evaluate the theory's predi ctions  about shifts in burden of proof as currently disputed claims  become settled.  They will also investigate the effects on burden  of proof of making an argument's first or last claim.    The final group of experiments will investigate circular  reasoning or question-begging in arguments.  The fallacy of  begging the question occurs when participants presuppose the  conclusion of an argument in trying to justify one of its  premises.  In the context of most arguments, however, the points  that a participant argues for (the conclusions) and the points  argued from (the premises) emerge as the argument unfolds and  depend on which points other participants accept.  Thus, in some  circumstances, but not in others, repetitions of a conclusion can  beg the question.  The experiments will examine conditions under  which subjects recognize instances of question begging.  ***",
