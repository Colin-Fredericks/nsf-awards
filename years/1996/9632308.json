Rare events, may have important,  even pivotal roles in ecosystems, but they are hard to  study.  From a conservation standpoint, rare events may be  of greater importance to diversity patterns than normal  events.  Studies of natural catastrophes can in turn provide  a biological and predictive framework for interpreting human  impacts on natural systems.  This knowledge is vital to the  design of biologically meaningful conservation plans.  Effects of volcanic eruptions on reef ecosystems (e.g. Mount  Pinatubo). By studying effects of the current eruption on  the reefs around Montserrat, we have an opportunity to  expand our knowledge of volcanic impacts on reef ecology,  and strengthen our effectiveness in reef conservation.    Dr. Brosnan will study the effects of volcanic eruption on  the reef community by repeating surveys of the reefs.  She  will set up permanent monitoring quadrats at impacted reefs  (south and east coasts), and control reefs on the northwest  coast that receive no volcanic input and monitor changes in  the reef community and compare changes in impacted and  nonimpacted reefs.    ***",
