 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530384  Millero         This research project is part of the US Joint Global  Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1)  a better understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic  and inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the  physical, ecological and biogeochemical factors and  processes which regulate the magnitude and variability of  these fluxes, and (3) placing these fluxes into the context  of the contemporary global carbon cycle.       This work is one of forty-four projects that are  collaborating in the Southern Ocean Experiment, a threeyear  effort south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone to track  the flow of carbon through its organic and inorganic  pathways from the air-ocean interface through the entire  water column into the bottom sediment.   The experiment will  make use of the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer and the R/V  Thompson.       It is known that the flux of gaseous carbon dioxide  from the atmosphere to the ocean is controlled by the airsea  difference in the partial pressure of CO2.  In the ocean the  dissolved carbon dioxide is in chemical equilibrium with the  carbonate and bicarbonate ions.  The carbonate ion  concentration controls the rate of dissolution and  precipitation of calcium carbonate, and the rate at which  inorganic carbon is delivered to the sediment.   What is not  known very well is how these inorganic relationships are  affected by biological processes in a region where  production and transformation processes are quite large.       This component concerns the direct measurement of the  carbonate system on seven cruises between 1996 and 1998.  This will involve measuring total inorganic carbon dioxide  (TCO2), the partial pressure of gaseous carbon dioxide  (pCO2), and total alkalinity (TA) in the surface waters, as  well as the pCO2 in  atmosphere, continuously along the  cruise tracks.  Complementary depth profiles of the oceanic  parameters will be made at some of the stations.       These measurements will be made in  cooperation with  the carbon-related measurements planned by other groups that  receive support to participate in the experiment.  The  resulting carbon-based and nutrient measurements should  provide the necessary field data that will be required in  examining the flux of carbon dioxide across the air-sea  interface and the changes resulting from primary  productivity and the oxidation of plant material.  ***",
