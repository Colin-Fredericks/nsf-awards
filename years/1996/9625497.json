 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robert Harris of the University of California, Berkeley is   being supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to continue his research in two distinct areas.  The   first deals with the existence of superpositions of handed molecules,   while the second deals with magnetic responses in molecules.  A basic   consequence of quantum mechanics is the existence of superpositions of   handed molecules.  Until recently there were no suggestions as to how to   prepare these fundamentally quantum objects.  Harris has very recently   advanced an elementary theory of how the superpositions may be prepared,   and their coherence assessed.   One purpose of the proposed research is   to generalize both the idea of these coherences and construct more   realistic and varied ways of preparing and measuring them.  Given their   production in a variety of conditions, it is proposed to investigate the   behavior of these superpositions.   In particular, the PI will examine   how they collide with other systems, as well as how their coherence   degrades in condensed matter.  Finally, rotational coherences which are   chiral will also be investigated.  The second area involves magnetic   responses in molecular systems which historically involves calculating   diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions separately.   A recently   proposed magnetic field density functional theory emphasizes that density   functional theory allows,  in principle, a gauge invariant theory to be   automatically constructed.   In addition, all responses are universal   functionals of the electron density in the absence of magnetic fields.     Calculations of magnetic responses will be carried out.   In addition, a   theory of changes in electron density due to distant groups and their   relation to magnetic responses, will be constructed.    The first aspect of this work deals with the existence of superpositions   of handed molecules, which arrises as a basic consequence of quantum   mechanics.  Until recently there were no suggestions as to how to prepare   these fundamentally quantum objects.  The PI and his colleague J.Cina,   have very recently advanced an elementary theory of how the   superpositions may be prepared, and their coherence assessed.   In work   to be carried out, a detailed theory will be constructed for real   molecules so that experiments may be carried out.   A second purpose is   to see how the excited state photochemistry, which is a consequence of   the superpositions, differs from that of ordinary handed molecules and   mixtures of those molecules.  The second aspect of this work deals with   Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.  (NMR) is used to determine the structure of   a variety of molecules and more complex systems such as proteins and RNA.     The assessment of these structures is based on the variation of the NMR   parameters of the system with changes in geometry and environment.  The   research proposed is based on a new method by the PI for calculating in a   systematic way the NMR parameters.  The method is based on the electron   density of the system, and how it changes with geometry and environs.     This way of looking at NMR parameters has no precedent and should be   useful in the construction of the electron density itself.",
