 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, is directed toward achieving a fundamental   understanding of catalytic reactions at solid surfaces.  Solid state   Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy used in situ  is the   principal instrumentation involved. Among the catalytic materials to be   investigated are zeolites, metal halides and metal oxides.  Theoretical   modeling via computer will provide guidance and confirmation in the   interpretation of experimental NMR results.  Transient approaches will be   used to determine the identity and structure of short-lived reaction   intermediates.  In addition, photodissociation processes in confining   media are to be studied.  This research will increase our understanding of how chemical reactions   promoted by catalysts take place.  Catalytic materials play a very   important role in the production of chemical products in such   technologically significant areas as the petroleum, lubricants, and   pharmaceutical industries.   Catalysts are used for many reasons and   significant among them are energy efficiency and a more positive   environmental impact.  The type of spectroscopy (NMR) employed in this   work is well suited to study the way catalytic reactions occur at solid   materials such as zeolites and metal oxides.",
