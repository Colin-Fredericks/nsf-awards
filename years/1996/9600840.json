 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600840  Marden    This  research  investigates the locomotor physiology  of  a  model  organism  at molecular through cellular,  organismal,  and  ecological levels, and will demonstrate how effects  at  one  level  interact  with effects at other  levels.  In  so  doing,  the research would lead to a novel understanding  of  mechanistic   and   evolutionary   processes   that   govern  performance physiology of muscle.    Dragonflies (Libellula pulchella) undergo a dramatic  change  in flight  performance  and  thermal  sensitivity  of  muscle  function  during adult  maturation.   Preliminary data suggest  that  the  mechanism  underlying  this  developmental  transition  is  a   tenfold  increase in calcium sensitivity of muscle activation,  which  appears  to  be caused by a change in isoform expression  of  the    calcium    regulatory   protein   troponin-t.     The  investigators  will  use recombinant troponin-t  to  perform  isoform   extraction/replacement   experiments   that   will  experimentally   demonstrate  the  role  that   age-specific  troponin-t  isoforms play in determining calcium sensitivity  of  muscle activation.  These experiments will provide  some  of the first data that address the specific cellular role of  troponin-t  isoform  variation.  Troponin-t  isoform  shifts  occur  during  muscle development in many types  of  animals  (including  humans),  as well as human heart  muscle  during  cardiac  arrest and recovery from cardiac arrest.  Mutations  in  troponin-t  cause, by mechanisms presently  unknown,  an  inherited  heart  disease  in humans  (hypertrophic  cardiac  myopathy).    Thus,   the   results   will   have    general  andpotentially even clinical value.    Preliminary  data  also  indicate that  changes  in  calcium  sensitivity of muscle activation affect the timing and force  generation of muscle twitch contractions, which in turn  may  cause  changes  in the energy efficiency of locomotion.  The  researchers  will  test this prediction by  determ ining  how  energy  efficiency  of flight varies  with  age  and  muscle  maturation.   They  will perform parallel  experiments  with  distantly   related  dragonflies  that  show   similar   and  dissimilar  patterns  of  muscle  maturation  in  order   to  determine if the results allow accurate predictions that can  be extended to other species.",
