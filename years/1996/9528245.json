The  Committee occupies a pivotal position in the statistical  community, providing expertise in methodology and policy  formulation.  Members of CATS are appointed by the Chairman of  the National Research Council.  This project is for core funding  for CATS.  CATS activities supported exclusively by core funding  are: one CATS meeting, CATS participation in the annual Board on  Mathematical Sciences Department Chairs Colloquium, the  initiation and administration of all CATS projects, and  continuous oversight of all CATS-related activities.  These  include giving recommendations on research directions to federal  agencies and reports on education in the statistical sciences,  interaction of the statistical sciences with other areas, the  health of the statistical sciences, and emerging research  directions.",
