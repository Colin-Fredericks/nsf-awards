 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIOUS system is an experimental software architecture  for efficient data management and I/O in heterogeneous  parallel and distributed computing environments. PIOUS  offers scalable concurrency control with standard  consistency semantics, presents global or segmented views of  parallel files to applications, and declusters physical data  for improved performance.  Concurrency control in PIOUS is  based on transactions, and permits either volatile or stable  file access semantics for increased throughput or resilience  to system failures.  The goal of this project is to complete  and implement the PIOUS prototype system on the PVM message  passing substrate.  The system will consist of an API  library that is designed to present familiar file system  syntax and semantics, while permitting multiple concurrent  accesses and declustering across multiple disk devices.  The  PIOUS infrastructure will  then be further enhanced by designing appropriate file  system primitives that will enable the efficient  implementation of high level file access semantics and  permit large structured and heterogeneous data sets to be  efficiently stored and accessed in distributed networked  environments.  An appropriate file model will be defined,  based on an extensible and flexible, multilayered  architecture, and will specify a set of access interfaces;  these methods will be realized as a suite of portable and  efficient runtime libraries and support software.  ***",
