 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular genetic tools are employed in an ever-increasing variety of fields in both academia and industry. This department, like many others, has offered a very good program in traditional cellular biology, but has been unable to offer courses addressing the theory or application of molecular techniques. Thus, many biology majors proceed to graduate academic programs and industrial workplaces without the background necessary to take advantage of these important tools. The Department of Biological Sciences is working to correct this deficiency by offering two new courses in molecular biology with strong laboratory components concentrating on modern molecular genetic approaches to basic biological questions.   Both courses emphasize a hands-on approach and accommodate students from a wide range of biology education backgrounds. The first course deals with traditional molecular subjects in the lecture and makes use of a project-oriented approach in the laboratory. Students work in small groups using a variety of modern molecular techniques to duplicate a published research program. This approach enhances instruction by placing techniques within their appropriate context, increases student interest, and encourages team working skills. The second course exposes students to the theory and practice of the different DNA fingerprinting techniques being used in many areas of biology. These exercises provide students with a practical working knowledge of a wide range of molecular techniques and a particular familiarity with DNA fingerprinting.   Students completing this course will be prepared to pursue this highly practical technology in areas of biological science ranging from ecology to forensics. Both courses are intended to enhance current upper-level biology courses, prepare students for independent research projects, serve as models for similar efforts at other undergraduate institutions, and provide the basis for outreach programs to K-12 instructors.",
