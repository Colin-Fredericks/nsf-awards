 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program of the Chemistry Division   of NSF, Professor Kenneth R. Fountain of Northeast Missouri State   University  will study the alpha effect, i.e. the rate enhancement in   nucleophilic substitution reactions deriving from the presence of a   second lone pair of electrons adjacent to the attacking pair on the   nucleophile.  The project lies within the NSF Program for Research in   Undergraduate Institutions.  The issue to be examined is the extent to   which single electron transfer (SET) models the reactivity in such   reactions.  Rates of transfer of alkyl groups from alkyldiarylsulfonium   salts to alpha or non-alpha nucleophiles will be measured.  Since the   sulfonium salts are amenable to electrochemical analysis,   structure-reactivity studies affording plots of log(rate) vs. redox   potential can be constructed and the effect of SET capability deduced   therefrom.  Computations at the 3-21G** level, kinetic isotope effect   studies, and certain studies of symmetric substitutions expected to lead   to radical trapping, will also contribute to the project.  Study of nucleophilic substitutions, reactions well known to   undergraduate students of organic chemistry,  will provide understanding   of an effect of a certain structural change of the nucleophile on   reactivity.  The experimental work will be supported by computational   modeling.  The project design encourages students to view their   individual work in the context of a larger and overarching scientific   goal.",
