 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630779  Gelvin  Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes the disease Crown Gall on many species of plants.  The molecular mechanism of Crown Gall tumorigenesis involves the binding of bacterial cells to the plant cell wall, and the processing of a region of the Ti-(tumor inducing) plasmid and transfer of this T-(transfer) DNA to plant cells.  Ti plasmid has been modified to be used as a vector for genetic engineering in plants.  As a result of two decades of research, we know much about the contribution of bacterial genes and proteins to T-DNA transfer and tumorigenesis.  However, we know little about the role plant genes and proteins play in these processes.  In an attempt to identify host-encoded factors necessary for Agrobacterium binding, T-DNA transfer and integration, and phytohormone signal transduction, Dr. Gelvin has recently screened different Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes and T-DNA insertion mutants for susceptibility to crown gall tumorigenesis, as well as the ability to express other T-DNA-encoded functions both transiently and stably.     In this research project, Dr. Gelvin's proposes experiments to identify specifically the steps of crown gall tumorigenesis that are blocked in Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants that have already been identified.  The characterization of these host genes will not only increase our understanding of crown gall tumorigenesis, but will also contribute to our knowledge of basic plant cell biology.  Finally, an understanding and the isolation of the host genes involved in these processes may allow us to manipulate these species so that they become more amenable to T-DNA-mediated genetic transformation.",
