 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to contribute scientific methods to improve the quality of social measurement.  Social concepts such as cultural beliefs and social norms are defined by social conventions, and unlike much physical and psychophysical measurement, have no direct outside criteria for comparison and validation.  Measurements necessarily must be inferred from the pattern of responses among informants.  One major focus of the research is on repeated measures of the cognitive representations of semantic structure for a single individual.  This would make it possible to measure the extent to which representations in the mind of one person correspond to representations in the mind of another person.  Such measurement facilitates the development of quantitative models of culture as shared cognitive representations.  It allows the precise measurement of the overall degree of sharing among members of a culture as well as the extent to which each individual, or subset of individuals, exhibits cultural differences due to individual variables such as gender, first spoken language, or occupation.  Breakdown in sharing in individual performance such as in the case of dyslexia or Alzheimer's disease might also be measured.  Another major area of the research is in the area of `information pooling.`  Information pooling occurs when several informants each provide their answers to the same set of questions; e.g., `will candidate A win the election` or `how much money can be saved by adopting policy B.`  When the informants' answers differ, it is important to be able to pool their answers to reach a `consensus.`  Over the last decade, the investigators have developed an approach to information pooling called `consensus analysis.`  Consensus analysis consists of a collection of statistical information pooling models for a variety of questionnaire formats.  In each format, it provides a process model for the measurement of the knowledge of the informants where, unlike the typical psychometric test-theory case, the answers to the questions posed to the informants are not known in advance.  The unknown answers can be estimated in the model to provide a `consensus answer key.`  The current research will develop the linkage of consensus analysis to the extensive literature on consensus algorithms in the area of classification research.  Typically consensus algorithms are non-statistical deterministic pooling procedures, and one objective of the research will be to develop statistical versions of the algorithms to deal with such problems as differential competence among informants or questionnaire reliability.  This will provide ways to factor error variance and response bias out of the pooling process by using standard statistical estimation theory.  The overall significance of the research is that it will provide new methods of social measurement comparable in quality to those used in areas such as perception and psychophysics, where direct comparisons with objective physical stimuli are utilized.",
