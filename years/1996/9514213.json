 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on jaw biomechanics has operated under the assumption that mandibular morphology  is a reflection of the stresses encountered during chewing behaviors. These chewing stresses  have been inferred using simple engineering models, despite claims that the structural and  material complexity of the mandible compromises the explanatory utility of such simple models.  By contrast, computer-driven mathematical models of the jaw's behavior are capable of making  very precise predictions about the stress environment. Application of such techniques, however,  is problematic because they require knowledge of certain variables (muscular forces, tissue  interactions under load, etc.) for which reliable measurement is not currently possible.  Improvements on both techniques can be realized through documentation of stress and strain  distributions under controlled experimental conditions. The proposed research will sample  mandibular bone strain simultaneously from multiple locations in preserved primate jaws under  a variety of controlled loading conditions. The profiles of recorded strain will be used to  evaluate the accuracy and reliability of alternative structural models of the mandible. This  research will allow the central issue in jaw biomechanics to be addressed; specifically, the  experiments performed under this proposal will provide a much clearer understanding of the  relationship of variation in mandibular form to differences in feeding behavior among the  primates.",
