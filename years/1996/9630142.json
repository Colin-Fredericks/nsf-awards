 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630142  Fowell      Central Asia represents a sizable gap in Quaternary paleoclimate  databases because relatively few sediment cores have been collected  from this part of the world.  This is particularly unfortunate due  to the growing need for detailed records of terrestrial climate  change and ecosystem evolution.  High-resolution climate data are  already available from oceans and ice sheets, and comparable  continental records are necessary in order to further understanding  of global climate changes.  Located in the interior of the Asian  continent, Mongolia is subject to the seasonal interplay of the  Siberian and Indian-African monsoons, home to numerous endemic  species of fish and insects, and the site of exceptionally well  preserved Mesozoic and Cenozoic vertebrate fossils.  Mongolia is  thus a natural field laboratory for paleoclimate research, and  climate records from this country have unique potential to  elucidate relationships between monsoonal circulation, glaciation,  orbital forcing, tectonic uplift, terrestrial climate change, and  rates of evolution.    As a prelude to in-depth studies of Mongolian climate history, a  planning meeting and field workshop for ten U.S. scientists with  research interests in paleoclimate, paleontology, and global change  will be held in Mongolia in the fall of 1996.  During a recent NSF-  sponsored workshop on Mongolian research held in South Carolina  during October of 1995, all ten of these scientists expressed a  keen interest in attending a one-month reconnaissance trip to   Mongolia.  Since the October workshop, plans for multidisciplinary  field-based research projects have advanced rapidly to the point  where an exchange of results and ideas between U.S. and Mongolian  scientists has become instrumental to the success of future  projects.  In addition to planning meetings and seminars, there  will be visits to potential field sites and collection of  preliminary samples in order to eliminate the difficulty and risk  of remote site sel ection.         The planning meeting will be held in Ulan Bator during August of  1996, during which time U.S. scientists will spend five days  meeting with members of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences to  exchange information and discuss logistics of potential projects.   Meetings will be followed by a two-week expedition to Lake  Khubsugul, with stops along the way to survey glacial features,  loess deposits, and shallow lakes or bogs suitable for collection  of short cores.  Khubsugul has been selected as the destination of  the field trip so that short sediment cores for preliminary  palynological, paleomagnetic, and carbon isotope analyses may be  collected from the lakeshore and from nearby ponds.  Furthermore,  the trip to Khubsugul is intended to ascertain the feasibility of  a large-scale coring project designed to extract and extended  paleoclimate record from this central Asian lake basin.  ***",
