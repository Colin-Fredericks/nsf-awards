 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9531290  Henkens  This Phase II SBIR project will develop and commercialize ASV-based instruments for metal testing in field or small laboratory applications for process monitoring and environmental testing. The methodology will include the use of screen printed sensors containing an ultramicroelectrode array of nanometer-sized gold particles, that provide high heavy metal sensitivity. The sensors will be inexpensively mass produced, pre-calibrated, and used with inexpensive, small, electronic monitors. Lead monitors, in particular, are clearly needed. Lead poisoning is an environmental and public health hazard of global proportion. Ubiquitous environmental contamination has led to mandated screening programs instigated by numerous countries that will require millions of tests annually, most accomplished in small laboratories. Demand for portable instruments capable of field and small laboratory testing for heavy metals in complex sample matrices is increasing dramatically, especially in the environmental market. Ground waters and industrial process waters and effluents require tests of metal levels; lead, copper, cadmium, mercury and zinc being of particular concern. Traditional heavy metal determinations employ relatively large, expensive instruments used under the supervision of skilled professionals. The fieldable sensor/monitor units resulting from this project can measure a wide range of metals and overcome the expense and difficulty of operating and maintaining these large instruments.  The expected products are disposable, high-sensitivity, metal-specific sensors paired with a reusable hand-held electrochemical monitor. The disposable sensors in combination with the monitor will determine the concentrations of lead, copper and other heavy metals and will meet the criteria of 10 minute assay times in field and small laboratory settings, with appropriate sensitivity and accuracy, at approximately $1.00 per test.  ***",
