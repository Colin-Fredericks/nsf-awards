 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9628949  Malone       This grant provides funding for research leading to the establishment of a knowledge base  for agile manufacturing.  The purpose of the knowledge base will be to collect and disseminate  knowledge about agile manufacturing and other agile business practices.  The project will  develop conceptual methodologies and software tools to help gather, codify, organize, and  distribute information on agile manufacturing practices.  The primary objectives of this research  are to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach and to develop the tools and methods  to expand and maintain an agility knowledge base.  This research will build on the Process  Handbook project, which is developing methodologies for analyzing business processes and an  on-line repository of business process descriptions, and the Intelligent Information Infrastructure  Project, which is developing tools for facilitating large scale electronic discussions and for  accumulating bodies of knowledge and experience.       If successful, this research will augment ongoing activities in the area of agile  manufacturing.  It should enable the collection of information from several agile manufacturing  projects and provide for the dissemination of that information within the projects themselves and  to industry seeking to implement agile practices.  The overall objective of the agile  manufacturing projects is to increase the productivity and profitability of U.S. industry.  ***",
