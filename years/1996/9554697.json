 "awd_abstract_narration": "A comprehensive course in polymer chemistry, comprising lecture,  discussion, laboratory, and field trips is designed for college  faculty who wish to incorporate material on polymers into lower  division chemistry courses or to teach upper division courses in  polymer chemistry.  The pedagogical approach aims to overcome much  of the reluctance to consider polymer chemistry as an important  aspect of undergraduate training in chemistry.  The course includes  polymer synthesis, modification, and molecular level  characterization and physical properties of macromolecules.   Biopolymers, especially lesser known ones such as the polyesters  produced by some bacteria, are included.  Polymer recycling is  discussed.  Contemporary topics in research in polymer chemistry  such as polymers for microelectronics, biomaterials, and  electronically conducting polymers also is included.  Visits to the  National Plastics Museum in Leominster, MA, Mypro, Inc., in  Clinton, MA, and the General Electric Research and Development  center in Schenectady, NY, are also planned.",
