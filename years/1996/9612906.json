 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612906  Hunter    Vanguard will create and evaluate a model process for systemic reform and ongoing innovation within a large school system. The essential elements of the Vanguard model are as follows:    * An entire K-12 school community builds its capacity to serve as a testbed for  innovation for the overall school system.    * A structure and culture become institutionalized in the testbed school community that encourages voluntary groups of teachers and others to initiate, investigate, plan, implement, and evaluate innovative practices that take into account new standards of student performances, as well as new opportunities offered through technologies.    * Computer-based technology, LAN/WAN Internet access, and electronic resources are ubiquitous across the school community and the members of the community are fluent in the use of such resources.    * The processes of building local capacity (e.g. professional development) are carried out in a manner that operationalizes and tests emerging policy initiatives of the school system leadership.    * Linking across the curriculum, linking across the community, and linking across the entire school system, are leveraged strategies for creating new environments for learning and teaching in the modern age.    * The linkages between the testbed school community and the rest of the system (e.g. in teacher-led professional  development forums or student work groups across schools) - made possible through the technology infrastructure and applications-promote rapid diffusion of the innovations across the system.    * Innovations in curriculum, instruction, collaboration, assessment, and school restructuring are evaluated using a wide range of assessments of student learning as well as costs, possible cost-displacements, and scalability across the system .    * The processes by which the school system supports and learns from the testbed  schools become institutionalized across all levels of the school system, thereby creating a school system in whic h innovation is a way of life rather than an occasional add-on activity.    Vanguard builds upon past and current research on educational reform and technology.  The success of Vanguard  could have a significant impact on our understanding of how school systems can make the transition from the industrial age to a knowledge-based society.  ***",
