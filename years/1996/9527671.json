 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Ramachandran - 9527671    Trickle bed and packed bed catalytic reactors are widely used in petroleum processing and in bulk chemical manufacturing processes.  Commercial applications include hydrocracking, hydrodesulfurization and fine chemicals manufacturing.  In such systems the interactions of hydrodynamics, mass transfer and kinetics are complex and the design of the reactor is initiated through numerical simulation.  Such simulations are useful in optimization studies and may provide guidance in reactor selection which is then followed by experimental testing of the most promising cases only.  The objective of this work is to develop new numerical techniques based on the boundary integral and the dual reciprocity methods to solve such physical/chemical problems on the particle scale and to incorporate these into an overall reactor simulation model.    The techniques that will be further developed include the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and the Dual Reciprocity Boundary Element Method (DRM).  The BEM can be used to solve partial differential equations and its advantage is the necessity to only discretize the surface of the object.  It has been used for the study of linear diffusion reaction problems for single reactions and networks of linear reactions.  This technique permits easy modeling when non-regular shaped catalyst particles such as trilobes, quadrulobes, wagon wheels, etc. are used.  DRM has been used in solving 2-dimensional non-linear diffusion reaction problems with partial wetting effects.  The emphasis in this work is on: (I) developing reliable a posteriori error indicators, (ii) standardizing the basis functions for the approximation of non-linear rate terms, (iii) developing 3-dimensional algorithms to simulate realistic catalyst shapes, and (iv) developing efficient methods for large scale computing of complex reaction networks.",
