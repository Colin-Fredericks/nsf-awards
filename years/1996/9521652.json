 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521652  Demers  This project will demonstrate experimentally and  analytically the feasibility of strengthening and  retrofitting steel girders in composite steel concrete  bridges with epoxy bonded carbon fiber laminates.  To  upgrade the flexural capacity, carbon fiber plates or tapes  are epoxy bonded to the girder tension flange. For  retrofitting, this material is epoxy bonded to the girder  tension flange which may contain pre-existing fatigue  cracks.  Three beams will be tested under static loading to  determine the flexural strength of a composite section of  concrete deck, steel girder, carbon fiber tape, and epoxy.  This will investigate:  Fatigue strength in the positive  moment region with pre-existing fatigue cracks; fatigue  strength as a function of applied stress range;  classification of fatigue strength according to the AASHTO's  Standard Categories; and the ability of retrofit to arrest  fatigue crack growth.    This project is a joint effort between the University of  Arizona and the Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  All full-  scale tests will be conducted at the University of Arizona.  The coupon tests will be performed at the Worcester  Polytechnic Institute.  The analysis of results and  development of guidelines and methodology for application of  this technique will be performed by the investigators at  both institutions.  ***",
