 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to acquire a Beckman Instruments Optima Series XL-A  Analytical Ultracentrifuge equipped with UV scanner and Rayleigh optical  systems. This instrument will replace 2 heavily used Beckman Model-E's in  the Analytical Ultracentrifuge Research Laboratory (AURL) at Boston  Biomedical Research Institute (BBRI). One of the Model-E's is currently  equipped with a real-time video-based Rayleigh optical system, developed by  the PI, that is being used heavily in sedimentation velocity and  sedimentation equilibrium analyses. The rapid acquisition Rayleigh system  has allowed the efficient application of the high precision time derivative  method, also developed by Dr. Stafford, for sedimentation velocity analysis  achieving a 100-1000 fold increase in the sensitivity of the  ultracentrifuge optics. The Model-E's have become increasingly difficult to  maintain and it is unlikely that Beckman Instruments will continue to  support them after they introduce the Rayleigh optical system in late 1995.  Many researchers at BBRI as well as many outside collaborators have  benefited from the ultracentrifuge facility over the years. The continued  viability of the AURL requires the acquisition of a new XL-A equipped with  Rayleigh optics. The instrument will be shared by seven major research  groups at BBRI and will be used in several on-going or planned outside  collaborations. Some of these researchers have benefited from the facility  in the past. Others are either currently or will in the future use the  ultracentrifuge facility to investigate various protein-protein and  protein-nucleic acid interactions. These include but are not limited to: P.  and A. Wang, structure, molecular weight of Caldesmon and the affect of  phosphorylation on its interactions with actin; T. Tao, structure and  molecular weight of calponin; future studies will involve studies of the  interaction of calponin with actin; T Tao, calcium dependence of  interactions between troponin I and troponin C; R Lu, interactions  of  myosin regulatory and essential light chains with the cloned regulatory  domain of the myosin Sl head; S.S. Lehrer, interactions of calponin and  caldesmon with tropomyosin, and studies of the end-to-end polymerization  properties of various cloned fragments of tropomyosin; H. Wohlrab,  investigation of properties of the mitochondrial phosphate transport  protein and interactions between it subunits; N. Sarkar, characterization  of recombinant poly (A) polymerase I and poly(A) polymerase I and their  interactions with primer RNA; Z. Grabarek, investigation of calcium  dependent conformational changes in calmodulin and troponin-C and the  calcium dependence of their interactions with target proteins; V. Raso,  Targeting c-erbB-2 Epitopes with scFv Immunotoxins and Acid-Releasable  Anti-Diphtheria Toxin (DT) Monoclonal Antibodies.",
