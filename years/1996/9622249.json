 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract   Berenstein  9622249    Berenstein will investigate several problems in complex analysis   and integral geometry which have applications to subjects like   computational algebra and medical imaging.  The original link between   these problems lies in the use of methods from complex analysis,   especially multidimensional residues. Specific questions on the first   subject include effective bounds for the Nullstellensatz over fields of   positive characteristic. On the second, the use of wavelets and   hyperbolic geometry to study, respectively, localized versions of the   Euclidean Radon transform and the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map for the   Laplace operator in the Euclidean plane.    The project involves an interplay between Pure Mathematics (complex   and harmonic analysis) and applications to several imaging and detection   problems. Most notable is the localization of the Radon transform using   wavelets. We expect that this algorithm will help to significantly decrease   the radiation dosage received by patients during CAT scans, as well as   reduce processing time. The last consideration would be especially   important if it could be applied to MRI scans and we plan to consider how   to adapt our method to this widely used medical imaging procedure also   (eventually helping reduce its cost). Another question we study is   motivated by a different imaging method, Electrical Impedance Tomography.   This low resolution but very low cost procedure has applications to   Medicine as well as Material Sciences (detection of cracks). Finally, the   problems of Commutative Algebra mentioned in the proposal also arise from   engineering applications, for instance, robot motion planning    and control of distributed parameter systems.",
