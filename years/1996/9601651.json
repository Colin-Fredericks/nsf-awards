The instrumentation includes an  oscillator power supply for use in melt-spinning and induction  melting for metal alloys, a furnace for mechanical testing at  high temperatures, a microhardness tester, upgrades and  attachments to a scanning force microscope, and parts for  building a machine for making cluster-assembled materials.  Research activities that will use the requested equipment  encompass the synthesis and characterization of metallic glasses  and nanocrystalline materials, studies of size and shape effects  on the coalescence of small-scale precipitates, and morphology  and corrosion of metallic glass alloys.  %%%  The research fills a national need for both research and  educational activities in the important area of new bulk metallic  glasses and nanocrystalline materials. The properties of these  new materials have sufficient potential that a considerable  investment has been made abroad for their study. It is important  that a strong effort be maintained in the US as well.  ***",
