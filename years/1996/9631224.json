 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9631224    Danyluk      Chemo-mechanical polishing (CMP) chemically enhances removal of the surface layers of metals, oxides, and polymers in manufacturing large-scale integrated circuits.  It is an alternative process to reactive ion etching (RIE) of semiconductor device, polishing of other non-metallic systems such as quartz for laser windows, and silicon nitride ball bearing.  The university has been developing hydrodynamic models for the tribological contact between a polishing pad and a silicon or silicon dioxide surface, measuring fluid film thickness, constructing sensors for the situ measurement of wear rates, and developing models for the wear of silicon dioxide.   This project provides an opportunity for two graduate students to spend three months of summer in industry implementing and applying the experimental techniques and models to the polishing of silicon dioxide (dielectric).  This collaboration will lead to am improved understanding of CMP through (1) the implementation of models and measurement techniques developed at the university; and (2) the knowledge gained through industry experience and the need for production of consumable and CMP tools.",
