 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zelevinsky    This award provides funding for a project that will mainly be conducted in   the following two areas: (A) Multivariate discriminants, resultants, and  hyperdeterminants. (B) Representations of quantum groups and piecewise-  linear combinatorics. Both of these subjects have deep relations with the  theory of multivariate hypergeometric functions. Another unifying feature  is that in both areas an essential role is played by new kinds of   combinatorics whose main objects of study are lattice points in convex  cones and polytopes and their piecewise-linear transformations. The   principal investigator is going to continue his work on the following   topics: (1) explicit polynomial formulas for multivariate discriminants  and resultants, (2) singular loci of discriminant varieties, (3) algebraic  and combinatorial properties of canonical bases in representations of   quantum groups, (4) geometry of totally positive matrices, (5)  Chow varieties of 0-cycles and symmetric functions in several vector  variables, (6) secondary polytopes and maximal minor polytopes.    This research explores connections between Combinatorics, Algebra, and   Geometry. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods   to study how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior   of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For   example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone   systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete   sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.",
