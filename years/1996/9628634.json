 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD - 9628634  Gutheil  MeHarry Medical College    The objective of this proposal is to expand research capabilities  and training opportunities in Biochemistry and Physiology, with an  emphasis on Molecular Biochemistry and Physiology, at Meharry  Medical College.  The proposal seeks to improve the research  infrastructure which supports a research and training program  focused on the molecular aspects of enzyme function and cellular  communication.  The specific aims of the proposal are:         1.   To further develop the opportunities within the            Department of Biochemistry for training in the discipline            of enzyme kinetics, Dr. Gutheil's research proposal will            focus on kinetic studies of the bacterial glutathione            dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase.         2.   To further develop the opportunities within the            Department of Biochemistry for training in the structure-            function studies of flavin monooxygenases, Dr. Atta-            Asafo-Adjei's research will focus on probing the            structure and function of rabbit liver flavin-containing            monooxygenase (FM05) by cassette and site-directed            mutagenesis.         3.   To further develop the opportunities within the            Department of Physiology for training in the discipline            of cellular signaling, Dr. Motley's research will focus            on mechanisms of mitogen-activated protein kinase            activation in VSMC.    The Departments of Physiology and Biochemistry are currently in the  process of expanding their capabilities in the areas of Molecular  Biochemistry and Physiology.  The proposed research will provide  training opportunities for under represented minorities in the  disciplines encompassed by the proposed research and allow these  research areas within the institution to be further developed.   This objective will be met by providing some salary support for  each of the investigators, by providing support for two minorit y  graduate students for two years, and by providing some support for  materials and supplies for the proposed research projects.",
