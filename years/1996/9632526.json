The research combines  experimental and theoretical studies to develop an understanding  of the interrelationship between the properties of nanostructures  and the degrees of freedom available for their design and  fabrication.  Materials to be studied include multilayers of  functionally dissimilar materials, e.g. metals and insulators,  arrays of nanowires, and ultrafine granular materials.  The MRSEC  also supports shared experimental facilities for materials  research, exploratory research through seed funding, and  collaborations with industry and other academic institutions.  The Center's educational outreach program includes summer  internships for talented high school students in collaboration  with the Johns Hopkins Institute for the Advancement of Youth.  The Center supports 7 senior investigators, 3 post-doctoral  research associates, 5 graduate students, 1 administrative  assistant, and 4 undergraduate students.  The MRSEC is directed  by Professor C-L. Chien.  %%%  The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at  Johns Hopkins University supports interdisciplinary research on  materials whose structure is modulated on a nanometer scale.
