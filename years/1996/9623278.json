These arise to describe the level spacing distribution functions for random matrix models. Other random variables  also have distribution function given by Fredholm determinants. The primary focus of this research is to describe the distribution function of random variables for different matrix models. In the classical case the operators are convolution operators, but for other models the operators are generalizations of the convolution type. The techniques already developed to study the classical Szego limit theorems will be generalized for use in the more complicated cases. If the random variable is of a certain discontinuous type, then the operators have singular symbols. The known theory for discontinuous symbols will be extended to apply in the more general setting. This will involve extensions of the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture.    Many physical systems possess such complicated behavior that exact predictions become impossible. However, it is sometimes still possible to describe the average or statistical properties of the systems. For   example in slow nuclear reactions it is important to understand the average properties of the energy levels of a compound nucleus. Quantum mechanics tells us that the energy levels of the system are simulated by   the eigenvalues of a large Hermitian matrix. A matrix is a square array of numbers and the eigenvalues are a set of fundamental numbers associated to the matrix. The purpose of the proposed research is to   study the statistical properties of the eigenvalues for different classes of randomly generated matriaes. The theory of random matrices also occurs in other areas of mathematics and physics, such as the distribution of  the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, the study of disordered conductors and chaotic systems.",
