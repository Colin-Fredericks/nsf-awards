 "awd_abstract_narration": "In today's industry, rapid prototyping is an integrated part of most engineering design and development processes because of its cost effectiveness and quick production capability of complex three-dimensional physical parts from computer models. Currently, the Computer Aided Design (CAD) Laboratory hosts more than 24 486-66 PCs, 2 RISC 6000 IBMs, and 1 SUN-SPARC model 41. Workstations are all computer networked and fitted with solid modeling and finite element analysis software. This project adds a rapid prototyping system that is necessary to enrich students' experience with such new technology.   In order to manufacture competitive products, engineering and engineering technology students must have the technical skills and appropriate methodology to design products and develop applications suited for today's modern and competitive industrial environment. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to develop a rapid prototyping capability at the CAD Laboratory. The incorporation of such modern techniques supported by actual industrial applications in the CAD Laboratory can greatly enhance both the teaching and training activities in the Mechanical Engineering Technology Department. It is estimated that 700 students annually can benefit from the training and exposure to this new technology. In addition, the proposed equipment will be part of the center for technical education and distance learning that was realized through an ARPA-TRP Manufacturing Engineering Grant to disseminate interactive educational courses to local universities, community colleges, and nationwide audiences.   This campus is also the main hub of an educational computer network called `Exel-Link,` which connects most of New York state industrial firms and educational institutions.",
