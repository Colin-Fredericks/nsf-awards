 "awd_abstract_narration": "The accurate perception of scientific and technological testimony in courts of law is often crucial to protect the interests of individuals and corporations.  In the civil justice system, significant monetary decisions hinge upon jurors or judges accurately perceiving the S/T testimony of scientists and engineers.  Technological and scientific innovations that are supported by reliable S/T data may not be fairly adjudicated if those data are not processed accurately by the judge or jurors making the decision.  In previous work in our laboratory, some of the difficulties jurors have processing complex S/T testimony in civil liability cases were examined.  In this study, we will examine the locus of the investigator role in the adversarial and inquisitorial systems.  We hypothesize that participants who adopt the inquisitorial role of investigator for the court will gain a more accurate and complete understanding of the S/T evidence than will participants who are asked to take the adversarial position.  Moreover, it is hypothesized that inquisitorial participants will bring a more representative distribution of evidence to the attention of decision makers than will the combination of the defense and plaintiff advocates in the adversarial system.  In our society, the legal system is where many decisions that affect the implementation of science and technology arise.  The current proposal seeks to provide information on the impact of important elements of the current adversarial system on the accurate perception of S/T evidence in civil proceedings.",
