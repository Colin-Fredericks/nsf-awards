 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  general  objective  of the research  is  to  develop  a  new  approach  for recognition of moving objects or parts as  well  as  extracting  and  classifying their trajectories.   A  prospective  application of this research is recognition of human gestures and  motion of body parts, such as limbs, fingers, etc.   The approach  is  based  on iconic recognition of image patches that correspond  to  object  surfaces that are roughly planar.   Each  surface  is  recognized separately invariant to its 3D pose, employing  affine  invariant   spectral  signatures  (AISS)  and   multi-dimensional  indexing  in the frequency domain.  The AISS are based  on  novel  Gaussian   kernels  with  2-dimensional  modulation   which   are  organized  in  subsets  of  distinct  orientations.   A   2-level  hierarchical   indexing   scheme  is  used   for   pose-invariant  recognition  of  flexible objects.  The indexing scheme  provides  pose  information  of each recognized object/part. Thus, full  3D  motion (including rotations) is directly available from processed  image   sequences.   A  novel  method  is  planned   for   motion  recognition   using   multi-dimensional  indexing   of   the   3D  trajectories of objects/parts.  The 3D trajectories of body parts  are  segmented  into motion vectors and then a set of  sequential  indices  is  constructed using ordered subsets  of  these  motion  vectors.  These ordered subsets are then used to vote for model",
