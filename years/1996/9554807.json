 "awd_abstract_narration": "A  common  feature of ecological field and laboratory courses  at  the   undergraduate   level  is  a  lack  of  appropriate   field  experiences.  In particular, field experiences for the most  part  consists  of mensurative habitat studies, e.g., making  lists  of  species   abundances  from  contrasting  areas.   However,   much  ecological  research  and some of the most  important  conceptual  advances  have arisen from manipulative experiments  designed  to  meet rigorous statistical standards of replication, dispersion of  treatments,  and avoiding the pitfalls of pseudoreplication.   To  address  this  dichotomy  between  teaching  and  research,   the  establishment  of  a  long-term  field  experiment   to   improve  undergraduate  teaching in ecology and environmental  science  is  proposed.  The long-term experiment is designed to address topics  of  ecological succession contrasting the effects of  mowing  and  fertilizer  treatments  in  upland  and  lowland  abandoned  farm  fields.    Elementary,  Middle  and High school pre-service  and  in-service  teachers,  and  students  taking  courses  in  Southern  Illinois  University's Environmental Studies Program (as a minor for a wide  range   of  major  degree  programs)  will  participate  in   the  establishment, running, data collection and analysis of the field  experiment.   The student's participating in the experience  will  assess  the  advantages, disadvantages and limitations  of  field  experiments,  and  be  prepared to integrate  research  data  and  results  in  an  understanding  of  ecology.   Because  of   this  intervention,  students'  will  better  appreciate  the  role  of  scientific  research  in understanding  the  natural  world.   An  important corollary is that the students will be better  able  to  describe  and  articulate  one of the most  important  ecological  processes,  i.e.,  succession.   The  improvements  to  the  SIUC  undergraduate   curriculum   that  will   occur   following   the  incorpora tion  of  the field experiment into appropriate  courses  will   be   a   model   for   other   programs   nationally   and  internationally.",
