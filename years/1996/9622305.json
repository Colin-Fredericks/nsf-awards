 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622305  Phillips       This project is a study of differential equations from two  areas, the   Ginzburg--Landau equations as they apply to superconductivity and  the  calculus of variations related to nonlinear elasticity. Features  of   solutions to the Ginzburg--Landau equations are to be studied.  Experimental   evidence for the materials they model and numerical simulations  for the   equations themselves indicate that stable solutions contain  coherent pattern   formations (vortex arrays). It is proposed to analyze solutions  for simple   geometries (e.g. cylindrical rods and thin films). The principal  investigator   seeks to establish the existence of these patterns and to  understand the   mechanisms that bring them about. He also seeks to determine how  one can  control the patterns (pin the vortex distributions). Doing this  will lead  to a better understanding of the models and to estimates for the  effectiveness   of a material to carry a supercurrent when subjected to an  applied current or  a magnetic field. The second part of the proposal deals with the  regularity of   solutions to variational problems related to nonlinear  elasticity. P. Bauman  and the principal investigator have established that solutions to  certain   boundary value problems from two dimensional elasticity are  locally Lipschitz   continuous homeomorphisms. It is proposed to investigate whether  or not these   solutions have singularities. Analytically this is to ask if the  solutions are   differentiable everywhere.  %%%       Scientists describe how a given material can conduct an  electric current  or how an elastic body can be twisted and bent by expressing such  phenomena as   solutions to mathematical equations (called partial differential  equations)   based on the underlying physics in each instance. The principal  investigator   studies the features of these solutions. For example in the case  of a   superconducting material (a material that can conduct electricity  very   efficiently) it is observ ed that the current naturally circulates  around a   symmetric array of points called vorticies. It is also observed  that if the   current is sufficiently strong the array begins to drift causing  the current   to die off and superconductivity is lost. Pattern formation and  the onset of   instability are features that can be investigated through the  solutions.  Understanding and being able to predict these features is  important both for   theory and engineering applications.  ***",
