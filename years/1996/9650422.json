 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1992, the Introductory Biology course has been taught as a tightly integrated lecture/laboratory experience involving group-based semester-long projects. One theme of the course, and of a special science course cluster for freshmen, is the study of light as a signal (gene regulation), as an energy source (bioenergetics), and as a tool for studying biological processes. This project makes heavy use of UVMS spectroscopy, some fluorimetry, and some microscopy. To increase students' understanding and appreciation of the role of light in biological processes, the department needs to add the techniques of fluorescent microscopy to increase the levels of measurement. In addition, the department is arranging to increase the opportunities for observing and recording experiments with the addition of another stereomicroscope with video camera and printer. Previously, there have only been limited controlled environment space and growth facilities for plant tissue cultures, cell suspension, and algal cultures. There is an effort to increase the capabilities for alternative environments so that students have more choices for experimentation.   Students who have completed these sorts of laboratory experiences are much more demanding in their later courses and tend to drive the department in new directions. They also disseminate to other students the message that research is intellectually stimulating and fun.",
