 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is for the acquisition of a Field-Emission Gun Scanning  Electron Microscope (FEG-SEM) and associated X-ray microanalysis  system. Field emission electron sources are very stable even at low  accelerating voltages (1 KeV) and their usage in a SEM greatly enhances  the capabilities of a FEG-SEM when compared with instruments that use a  thermionic emitter electron source. The most significant advantage of a  FEG-SEM is its ability to image specimens that are below the limits of  resolution of a conventional SEM. A FEG-SEM can have a resolution that  is 1 to 1.5 orders of magnitude greater than a comparable conventional  SEM. The fact that a FEG-SEM can operate at low accelerating voltages  means that one is often able to examine samples that do not require  much additional conductive coating.    Despite the large number of researchers at the University of Georgia  who routinely use scanning electron microscopy, a SEM of suitable  quality for high resolution/low KeV work is presently not available  anywhere on campus. The ability to create SEM images of microscopic  specimens is of critical importance to a wide variety of researchers at  the University of Georgia. This is especially important when one is  working at very high magnifications where the coating itself may be  what is visualized and not the object of study. As configured, this  FEG-SEM would also enable researchers to conduct elemental analyses  using EDS X-ray at a much higher level of precision than is possible  with the Center's present instrument. A final advantage that a FEGSEM  has over the Center's present SEM is the ability to capture the images  digitally in a high resolution format that can then be further  processed or analyzed either on the Center's imaging computers or on  any computer linked to the Ethernet.    The Center for Ultrastructural Research is the central facility that  provides University of Georgia researchers a variety of specialized  equipment and expertise in the area of electron and light mic roscopy.  For the past five years the Center has assisted with an average of 60  different research laboratories representing 25 different departments  or academic units per year. The Center also teaches formal courses  (Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy,  Techniques in Modern Microscopy) to both graduate and undergraduates  students. The addition of a FEG-SEM to the Center would greatly enhance  the research capabilities of those working with both biological and  non-biological specimens and is seen as a critical acquisition in  ensuring that researchers and students have access to state of the art  imaging instruments.",
