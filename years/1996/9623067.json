 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spencer    The Probabilistic Method has been developed intensively and become one of  the most powerful and widely used tools applied in Combinatorics. In this  methodology, as developed by Paul Erdos, one proves the existence of a  combinatorial object by showing that a suitably defined random object has  the desired properties with positive probability. Closely aligned is the   study of Random Graphs and other Random Structures. Also closely aligned is   the analysis of Randomized Algorithms in Computer Science. A particular set  of problems in this investigation involve radom greedy algorithms, which  combine all of these elements. Asymptotic packing is a problem of current  interest. Given a family of objects, one wants a disjoint subfamily, a   packing, taking up as much space as possible. Results over the past decade  have given general conditions such that almost all of the space can be  covered. This project considers bounds on the amount of space not covered.  Recent years have seen the use of more subtle probability methods in this  area. Martingales have long been a powerful tool for probabilists, but  now we are seeing how to use them to give strong bounds on discrete   problems. The Lovasz Local Lemma and probability inequalities of Jason and  Talagrand are used to good effect. Random algorithms are analyzed via   birth processes and differential equations. The percolation of the random  graph when average degree is near one is analagous to bond percolation in  the plane near critical probability. For random graphs, the appropriate  reparameterization is known. For bond percolation on the n by n grid, an  analogous result is in sight. The random graph percolation also corresponds  to a birth process with the expected family size near one. This gives new  insight into the random graph model and led to a surprising connection  between enumeration of graphs and a conditional form of Brownian motion.    This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of  Combinat orics is to find efficient methods to study how discrete collections  of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely   important to modern communications. For example, the design of large   networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of   algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this  makes use of combinatorial research.",
