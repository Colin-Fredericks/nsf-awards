 "awd_abstract_narration": "The instrumentation for this project is designed principally for an innovative laboratory course to help students grasp both system and circuit aspects of modern wireless systems. This rapidly growing area includes personal communication networks, intelligent transportation systems, and other applications that employ micro-, meter-, and millimeter-wave frequency bands.    This project establishes a Wireless Systems Design Laboratory and an associated course that enables students to develop knowledge of the principles of wireless systems and circuits and the relationships between them, gain practical experience in related system and circuit engineering techniques, and acquire key skills in using modern engineering tools.    To motivate students, the project uses a simple personal communication system (a pager) as a case study. Experiments are based on signal flow through the system together with performance characteristics of its individual components. The course also features computer simulation, computer-assisted design (CAD), and fabrication and test of component designs.    The unique integration of circuit and systems engineering fundamentals makes the course a model for electrical engineering curricula. For students specializing in related areas, this lab provides an excellent foundation for further study. The course is also part of an integrated curriculum development effort in the wireless/radiofrequency and communications area. The ability to develop new senior elective courses with hands-on content for the revised curriculum bodes well for highly productive use of the equipment. For example, additional use of the proposed instrumentation is planned for senior design projects.",
