The researchers work in the newly created area of Set Theoretic Analysis.  This is a branch of Real Analysis, the theoretic foundation of Calculus, that is characterized by extensive use of modern set-theoretic techniques.  The objectives of the project are to further understanding of the basic properties of such a fundamental concept in the whole of mathematics as the notion of a real function.  New developments in Set Theory will provide the necessary tools to make the realization of this objective possible.  In addition to the senior personnel, the project involves five graduate students (two of whom are women).  Their involvement in an international activity, at this early stage of their careers, will be of great importance for them and will likely lead to broader international cooperation in the future.      This research in mathematics fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.    ***  ??",
