The Symposium  will  be  held  at Dartmouth College from August 26th to August 30th, 1996. This  conference   is   the   largest   (approximately   150   participants)  international  meeting on fundamental research in  ice.  The  previous  meeting  was held in Sapporo, Japan in 1991, and the last  meeting  in  the  United  States  was  held in 1982. The  research  topics  at  the  Symposium span a range of disciplines including such areas as physics,  chemistry,  geophysics, geochemistry, and glaciology. The  results  of  the  Symposium  will be published and will be of immediate  use  in  a  range of scientific and engineering fields.  %%%  This  award  provides  partial  support  for  the  1996  International  Symposium on the Physics and Chemistry of Ice.
