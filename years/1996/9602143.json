 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602143  PI:  Sur  The long term objective of this project is  to elucidate the mechanisms by which the activity of developing nerve cells   during embryonic development influences the patterns of connections in the brain  to generate a functioning system.  It is postulated that the mechanisms involved in development may be similar to those known to play a part in regulating the plasticity  of  connections of the mature brain.  The proposed experiments address the role of nitric oxide, a substance recently shown to play  a part in the transfer of signals from one nerve cell to another,  in  regulating the establishment of synapses (the structures through  which nerve cells in the brain communicate).  It has previously been demonstrated that substances that block the  normal function of the relevant synapses, also prevent the normal development of the visual  processing region of the brain. This may be effected through changes in the permeability of the cells to calcium ions.  The overall outcome of these experimented will be  to provide a fuller explanation of  how orderly  patterns of nerve connections develop in the brain.",
