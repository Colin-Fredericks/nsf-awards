 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623750  Sullivan         Mississippi's eight public universities are graduating  minority students in science, mathematics, engineering, and  technology (SMET) fields in unprecedented numbers!  The success of  the Mississippi Alliance for Minority Participation (MAMP) in  causing this increase over the past four years has been the direct  result of a true partnership among member institutions which  features the sharing of resources to achieve a common goal.  The  Mississippi Alliance, especially at the historically white  universities, has a growing enrollment trend in SMET disciplines.   Together, these eight institutions increased in the B.S. degrees  granted to minority students in SMET from 288 in 1991 to 472 in  1995.  The dramatically increased pool of SMET minority students  now in the pipeline for graduate school dictates an added focus for  MAMP in the Phase II.  We must help these students more effectively  to earn graduate degrees in SMET.         MAMP Phase II objectives are:       1.  To increase the number of minority SMET graduates from 543       annually in 1996 to 782 annually by 2001, a forty-four percent       (44%) increase over the five-year period.              2.  To significantly increase the number of minority students       who enroll in graduate programs.         3.  To significantly increase the number and percentage of       minority students enrolled in SMET at the historically white       institutions.         4.  To significantly increase the retention rates at all MAMP       universities.         5.  To forge cooperative links with business and government       across the state and region.         To achieve these objectives, MAMP will build on the experience  of the past four years in developing and implementing strategies  which are focused on empowering students to take responsibility for  their own success.  These strategies were developed with the  assistance of students, whose participation in the design of  activities will continue to guide the framework  of the MAMP  approach.  In addition to the bridge to graduate school, activities  to be emphasized will include peer mentoring and study groups;  workshops; undergraduate research, both academic year and summer;  summer bridge programs for freshmen and community college transfer  students; drop-in centers; stipends; outreach programs with pre-  college students; recruitment; and curriculum reform.  Formative  evaluation will provide the necessary continuous feedback required  for maximum success.  Dissemination activities will be expanded  from primarily an inter-institutional focus to the region and  beyond.",
