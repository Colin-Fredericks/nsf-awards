 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides assistance in improving laboratory instruction in introductory physics courses. Faculty believe that many students in these courses fail to develop adequate understanding of the basic concepts presented.   Therefore, this project addresses the identified reasons for this failure:  students are not (l) actively involved in the design of experiments; (2) sufficiently engaged in small group, collaborative learning; (3) receiving feedback on the results of many experiments; or (4) using their laboratory time efficiently and for laboratory-dependent activities.   This project is making improvements in laboratory instruction by revising the curricula of two introductory physics courses and integrating the use of microcomputer-based laboratory tools into the laboratory component of those courses.   Students taking the physics courses improved by this project are in majors that prepare them for work as technicians in manufacturing, engineering, or technical service environments.   This project can serve as a model for the instruction of physics to college students in technical programs.  Evaluation of both program improvements and student outcomes can be conducted as part of the project.",
