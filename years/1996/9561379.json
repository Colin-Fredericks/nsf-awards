 "awd_abstract_narration": "9561379  Chandler     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to discover one or more chemical additives for LiBr-H2O vapor absorption chillers that will significantly improve absorption rates compared to currently available additives. Current state-of-the-art absorption chiller technology uses performance additives to increase rates of vapor absorption in order to reduce absorber size and cost and to make the technology economically feasible. An additive meeting this goal will enable absorption chillers to be built with significantly smaller copper tube heat exchangers, resulting in reduced first costs. This in turn will allow for increased market share for absorption chillers in the air conditioning industry, and significantly enhance the competitiveness of this non-CFC containing alternative technology. Candidate additives will be selected based on the chemical properties that can be expected from their structure. Absorption rate enhancement activity will be determined using a falling film test absorption machine.   Potential commercial applications include all machines in service and all new designs of LiBr-H2O absorption chillers, used for cooling buildings requiring 100 tons to several thousand tons.",
