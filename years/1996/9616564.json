The Center will draw upon the efforts and expertise of a wide ranging group of San Francisco Bay Area participants from industry, research, and education to formulate powerful responses to challenges and opportunities in science, mathematics, engineering and technology education.  During the proposed planning period, the Center will initiate reexamination of the basic methods and practices of these fields in light of the pedagogical potential to newly developing learning technologies.    At the heart of the Center's activities will be a set of carefully selected projects that address major educational challenges and opportunities.  The Center is particularly interested in projects that focus on the convergence of new hybrid technically-augmented learning spaces/situations and new pedagogical theory.  By focusing efforts on a specific problem or content area of sufficiently wide interest to the fields, the Center will be able to identify core issues for education as a whole; and thus be able to design generalizable research strategies.  It is anticipated that important work will be undertaken by members from primary and secondary school system and by informal educations (such as directors of public libraries or broadcasting groups) of different kinds.",
