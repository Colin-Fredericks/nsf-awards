 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623615  Garcia         The Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities (WAESO)  is a regional alliance building upon the highly effective Southern  Rocky Mountain AMP which is well on its way (and ahead of schedule)  to completing its goal of more than doubling the number of minority  SMET B.S. degrees in the region.   By adding three institutions in  Nevada, the WAESO alliance adds to the 35 colleges and  universities, 7 professional organizations, 2 government  laboratories, 4 educational organizations, 16 corporations and 147  academic and support programs of the Southern Rocky Mountain AMP.   A key component to student success is SMET  faculty participation  which is also similarly extensive.  WAESO draws on over 500  resource individuals (349 of which are SMET faculty) at 75 campuses  and participating organizations.  Approximately 85% are university,  government laboratory or industry scientists and engineers, while  15% were administrators.  Just over 40% of these resource  participants are underrepresented minorities themselves.         WAESO will help undergraduate students in all of the eligible  SMET areas including biological/life sciences, chemistry, computer  and information science, engineering, geosciences, mathematics,  physics and astronomy, agricultural science, technology, and other  eligible NSF fields.  With NSF funds, 600 undergraduate students  per year will participate in: (1) Undergraduate Summer Transition  to Upperclass (for college sophomores and juniors; community  college students expecting to go on to a baccalaureate); (2)  Faculty-Directed Undergraduate Student Projects (for community  college or four-year college students); (3) On-Site Peer Study  Groups (for incoming freshman in their summer prior to  matriculation, community college, or four-year college students);  (4) The National Electronic Peer Group Study Network (NEPS); (5)  Hypermedia Financial Aid and Academic Program Locator (for incoming  students, community college, and four-year college stude nts); (6)  computerized Undergraduate Preparation program for Graduate Study:  Sophomores, Juniors, Seniors; (7) Curriculum Development and  Reform: Summer Bridges, Undergraduate Research; and (8) Internship  Programs (for community college and four-year college students).   Additionally the WAESO will disseminate information on academic  programs, internships, GRE test taking skills, and other important  skill building workshops to another 400 undergraduate minority  students per year.  In all, for the 5-year period, the WAESO plans  to have 5,000 undergraduate minority SMET student participating in  activities and utilizing the services and advanced interactive  databases produced by the alliance.  Non-NSF funds will be used to  serve 10,066 students at the pre-college level through Project  PRIME and the navajo Higher Education demonstration Model which  have shown substantive increases in the number of minority and  majority students who actually graduate from high school and enter  college with SMET programs.",
