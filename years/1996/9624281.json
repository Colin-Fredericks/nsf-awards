 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Vincent Catalano, Department of Chemistry, University of Nevada,   Reno, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic   Program of the Chemistry Division under a Faculty Early Career   Development Award  for studies of extended metal-metal interactions.   Multi-metallic complexes will be prepared by bridging multiply bonded   metal-metal dimers to late transition metal complexes using bidentate or   multidentate ligands.  The reactivity of these systems with small   molecules such as carbon dioxide will be explored.  Also, helical shaped   platinum bipyridine complexes will be prepared by covalently linking   multiple bipyridines through alkene linkages.  These complexes have the   potential to act as vapo-, baro-, or solvato-chromic sensors. The   educational plan is aimed at increasing science literacy at all levels of   education through simple programs that can be implemented based on a   `think globally-act locally` approach, which includes tying chemical   concepts to topical issues, integration of teaching with research, and   public outreach through chemistry club and science fair activities.  Synthetic systems will be designed in which metal atoms can interact with   one another in extended linear networks.  These systems are expected to   be unique in their reactivity and in their physical properties due to the   extended metal-metal interactions.  They are of fundamental interest from   the standpoint of understanding metal-metal bonding and through-space   interactions, and they may have applications as sensors and in small   molecule activation.  The educational plan focuses on modifications of   traditional chemistry courses to include topical issues and to integrate   teaching with research.",
