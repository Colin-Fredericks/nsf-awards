 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major scientific objective of this proposed four-year study is to understand the coupled ocean mixed layer-ice system response to the passage of atmospheric storms.  The most intense surface cooling and wind stresses in the Arctic are associated with these storms, and their long-term cumulative effects on the heat and water budgets for the Arctic Ocean cannot be predicted without including (i) realistic mixed layer physics, (ii) ice thermodynamics, and (iii) three-dimensional wind-driven ocean circulation.  The investigator has shown in previous work that oceanic instabilities may lead to significant deep oceanic convection and possible formation of bottom water.  The initial energy source to trigger these instabilities may be provided by transient atmospheric forcing.    Numerical models will be developed including a three-dimensional simulation of the upper ocean (temperature, salinity, circulation, and ice) response to passage of atmospheric storms.  This numerical model will consist of an existing ocean primitive equation model with embedded turbulence-closure mixed layer and an ice model with realistic thermodynamics and mechanical properties.  The embedded mixed layer will include previously-neglected physics to predict the onset of conditional instabilities and possible formation of deep water.    The realistic prediction of deep convection is necessary to understand the start of the global conveyor belt and the role of the oceans in climate change.  A major deficiency in earlier ocean models has been the lack of adequate convection physics to realistically predict the correct temperature and salinity properties for the convectively-produced deeper water masses.  The proposed modeling program, including realistic storm forcing and realistic ocean convection will directly tie atmospheric forcing and ice thermodynamics to mixed layer dynamics and the start of the global conveyor belt in the Greenland-Iceland Seas.  The results will lead to more realistic parameterization of subgri d scale convection of heat, mass, momentum, nutrients and tracers in basin and global oceanic models.",
