The project activities will apply physics and mathematics to experimental observations and studies of astronomical sources of radio emission; measurements of distances, velocities and vectors, analysis of plate motion data and studies of earthquakes; and investigations of the earth's atmosphere, its variations and human effects on the environment. The students will engage in classroom discussions, group activities, research and field trips. Each student will be provided an opportunity to work with a scientist or mathematician who will serve as a mentor. The Observatory's instrumentation and computers will be used in the gathering and analysis of data, in the electronic networking of the students with each other and with the Observatory staff. There will also be group activities throughout the year and strong interactions with the science teachers and other students in the class.  ***",
