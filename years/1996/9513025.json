 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds for the purchase of an area-detector  facility for macromolecular crystallography. Requested equipment  includes an image-plate area detector and associated computer for data  collection, an X-ray generator, a heat exchanger, focusing mirrors, and  cryogenic equipment for low temperature (100 K) data collection.       This proposal is part of a major effort by the University of Utah  to move from a single-investigator laboratory in the area of  macromolecular crystallography to a multi-user facility. An important  first step in this effort was the hiring of Dr. Ramakrishnan (P.I.) as  a senior faculty member. The University also recently created a  Research Assistant Professorship, currently held by Dr. Bancroft, whose  duties include maintaining and upgrading X-ray equipment and associated  computing. The expanded facility will be used to solve structures of  macromolecules related to a wide variety of research at the University  of Utah, including: HIV-1 structure and assembly, ribosome structure  and function, chromatin structure, protein-RNA recognition,  transcriptional regulation, ubiquitin biochemistry, protein turnover,  isoprene biochemistry, and hypertension.       Macromolecular crystallography at the University of Utah is  currently being performed by Dr. Hill (co-P.I.). The Hill laboratory  maintains and operates an R-axis II image-plate area-detector. A large  number of projects, originating both within the Hill laboratory and in  collaboration with others, have saturated the existing equipment.  Indeed, many projects already languish for lack of available detector  time. With the arrival of Dr. Ramakrishnan in September 1995, this  already large demand will increase dramatically. Furthermore, the  thriving biomedical research community at the University of Utah is  increasingly focused on biological problems with essential structural  components and this new emphasis will place increased demand upon the  X-ray data collection facility in the near  future. Finally, a number of  new structural projects are expected to emerge with the recent opening  of the Huntsman Cancer Center (est. 40 new faculty positions) and a new  Genome Sequencing Center (focused on extreme thermophilic bacteria).  Thus the purchase of a second data collection facility is essential  and, indeed, the anticipated growth is expected to more than saturate  even the expanded facility.       The University of Utah will provide matching funds for 50% of the  instrumentation requested in this proposal. A second significant  University contribution to the expansion of macromolecular  crystallography at Utah is the remodeling of space to provide the  infrastructure necessary for an efficient, multiuser crystallographic  facility. Following proposed remodeling, the major structural groups  will occupy greater than 10,000 sq. ft. of contiguous space with  extensive shared facilities including X-ray data collection and  computer graphics suites, biophysical instrumentation laboratories,  constant-temperature crystallization rooms, and preparative  laboratories and cold rooms.       In summary, the University has made a major commitment to create  an expanded macromolecular crystallography facility that will both  complement and serve a vital biomedical research community. The  purchase of the new area detector facility described in this proposal  is an essential step in realizing that goal.",
