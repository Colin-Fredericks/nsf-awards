In this proposal a combination of  numerical and analytical techniques will be used. We propose to  determine the domain of existence of invariant tori both by using  recursive generation of the Fourier series for the tori, and by  continuation of the Cantor sets from the anti-integrable limit. The  goal is to develop methods for estimating practical stability  boundaries and for investigating the transition to chaotic behavior.  Computations will determine the robustness of the tori of various  frequency vectors, leading to a generalization of the noble numbers  that provide the most robust frequencies in two dimensions.  A study  of one dimensional, resonant tori will also be undertaken-these may be  more persistent than two-tori, and form an important component of the  barriers to transport. Transport in four dimensions. will be studied  by numerical computation of exit time decompositions for cylinders of  various homotopy types. Our goal is the development of a geometrical  description of trapping regions and resonance zones and a  characterization of the practical stability domain around an elliptic  point. New techniques for control of transport will be developed for  symplectic systems.    All of the fundamental equations of physics are formulated as  Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We propose to study the structure of  the orbits of these systems with the motivation being to understand  the problem of \"transport.\" This is of primary importance in such  areas as particle accelerator confinement, chemical reaction rates,  fluid mixing, plasma confinement in magnetic fusion devices, asteroid  and planetary ring stability, etc. The basic question is: how does a  system evolve from one state (e.g. a confined beam in an accelerator),  to another (e.g. beam hits the tunnel wall), and how long does this  take. Typi cally trajectories must wend their way through exotic  structures such as Cantor sets and self-similar fractals, some of  which exhibit a remarkable \"stickiness\", in order to move through the  phase space. The construction and visualization of these structures  requires careful computer study guided by mathematical insight. A  major problem is that the systems of interest correspond to four and  higher dimensional spaces--our ordinary three-dimensional intuition  fails. In various applications transport is either to be encouraged  (speeding up reaction rates) or discouraged (confining particles); we  will investigate techniques for accomplishing both tasks.  ***",
