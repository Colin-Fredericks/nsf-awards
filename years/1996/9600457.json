Great thinkers - Aristotle, Hobbes, and Darwin,  to name a few - have pondered over the existence of  cooperation in both humans and non-human animals.  Although  there are many different categories of cooperative behavior,  reciprocal altruism has received, by far, the most  attention. In order to model reciprocity, researchers have  adapted the mathematical theory of games and added an  evolutionary element to this technique.  It has, however,  been difficult to test models of reciprocity . Part of the  difficulty, no doubt, was finding a reasonable ecological  scenario in which animals were hypothesized to use  reciprocal altruism, and then devising controlled  experiments to examine which strategies animals invoke in  such systems.  Without question predator inspection behavior  has become the paradigmatic case for systematically  examining reciprocity and the evolution of cooperation.  Predator inspection in animals is essentially analogous to  guard duty in the army and an ideal system within which to  study cooperation.  I will employ field studies, laboratory  experiments, and the creation of new mathematical models to  examine: 1) the costs of predator inspection and how such  costs relate to reciprocity and the evolution of  cooperation, 2) how assortative interactions favor the  evolution of cooperation, 3) cultural transmission, predator  inspection and the evolution of cooperation, and  4) the  evolution of cooperation in large groups.   An incorporation  of 'natural selection thinking' into human behavioral  experiments could have a large impact on studies of human  cooperation. Before such bold statements can be supported,  however, animal experiments should be undertaken to test  evolutionary models of cooperation.  If such experiments are  successful, there is great reason for optimism with respect  to human co operation, because strong precedence exists for  incorporating evolutionary models designed to examine  cooperation in non-humans into the human realm.  The  experiments I outlined above are the first step in this  direction.",
