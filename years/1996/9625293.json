 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625293  Reimanis    A coordinated teaching and research program that targets  several national critical needs in the semiconductor and the  structural ceramics industries will be implemented.  The  educational component will emphasize materials selection in  design and will develop the integration of computer-based  design and/or numerical modeling into several undergraduate  classes in materials science.   The research aspect of the  program will examine relationships between the residual  stress distribution and the fracture behavior in graded  composites. Graded composites represent a new class of  materials in the sense that many of their properties can not  be predicted with existing scientific models. One of the  P.I.'s long term goals is to develop some of these models.  The effect of the size scale of the microstructure relative  to gradation on mechanical properties will be examined by  synthesizing composites with different graded layer  thicknesses and different gradation architectures employing  vapor deposition, and powder metallurgy. Both thermal and  mechanical loading will be used to examine failure  mechanisms. Crack trajectories will be observed so that  fracture criteria may be developed.  %%%  The proposed research plan of this CAREER proposal is to  develop an understanding of the failure mechanisms in  metal/ceramic composites and coatings that are  compositionally graded.  Understanding these mechanisms will  enable materials engineers to design better advanced  materials for the automotive and aerospace industries.  ***",
