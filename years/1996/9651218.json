 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of advanced computer simulation technologies such as finite elements has become increasingly common in engineering design. This is especially true in linear and structural problems, where the computer tools have developed to the point where most graduates of an engineering program can use them on a regular basis. Because of the mathematical and physical complexities of fluid mechanics, CFD software has not reached this same state of ease of use. In spite of the complexities of using CFD, it is becoming increasingly clear that engineering undergraduates must have some exposure to the technique.   The objective of this project is to develop a national model for appropriate integration of CFD into an undergraduate curriculum to support the design process. This is being accomplished through a series of projects in several different courses. All students in the program are exposed to the fundamentals of CFD to learn its strengths and limitations, and those who have an interest have the opportunity to develop an expertise in using the software. This is done in conjunction with experiments using both existing equipment and the proposed equipment. This project is part of an overall plan to more intensively integrate computers into the curriculum.",
