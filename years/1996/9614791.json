 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614791  Strzepek    In November  5-7, 1991, the First National Conference on Climate Changes and Water Resources Management was held in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to inform water resource managers about the state of the science on climate change, the ability to predict regional climate change, and management strategies for coping with climate change.  Almost five years have passed since the conference, and there have been major developments in our understanding not only of climate change and water resources, but also of climate variability  and water resources.  There is much more certainly about climate change and there have been significant improvements in capabilities to forecast extreme events and long-term climate.  In addition,  a significant amount of research has been done on how water resource managers can prepare for changes in extreme events and climate.  Water resource managers and planner can benefit by meeting with scientists and water resource researchers to learn about and discuss the latest developments in science.  In addition, they can benefit from discussions about how to plan for and adapt to changes in climate.    We propose to organize a conference that will present the latest developments in the understanding of climate change, climate variability, forecasting, and hydrologic analytic methods as they relate to water management.  The presentations will be by academic,  govenment, and other researchers and by water resource managers.  The target audience will be the research community and water resource managers.  The conference will be organized so water managers can learn about the latest research on managing water resources in light of climate variability and climate change and can tell researchers what  additional Climate variability and climate change.  We intend to involve all the major federal agencies information, methods, and models the water managers need to successfully adapt to the risks  from involved in climate change and climate variability related activities.     The conference will take place in 1997 to allow sufficient time for organization and advertising.  We hope to attract 100 to 150 attendees. Speakers will be solicited and invited based on the relevance of their work to the conference goals and objectives.  An emphasis of the conference will be feedback from water resource mangers on where federal research on climate change, variability, forecasting, and water resource management to cope with climate should be directed.  A proceedings with the best peer reviewed papers will be published .      Sessions will be on such topics as the use of improved weather and climate forecasts  in water resources management, impediments to the use of weather and climate forecasts in water resource management, water resource management under uncertainty, implications of climate change for long term supply and demand management, use of models and other analytic techniques to analyze vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, and incorporation of climate change in formal analytic methods for water resource management.",
