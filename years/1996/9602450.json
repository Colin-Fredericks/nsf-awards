 "awd_abstract_narration": "LIGASE: Long Island Group About Science Education    The goal of LIGASE (Long Island Group about Science Education) is to educate a highly skilled work force for the growing biotechnology industry on Long Island. A consortium consisting of SUNY Stony Brook, Nassau Community College, Suffolk Community College, Brentwood High School, Uniondale High School, and firms utilizing the Long Island High Technology Incubator has been formed to accomplish this goal. Three different strategies are being used to develop and deliver the curricula:  1) the Teacher Enhancement Institute, located in the School of Professional Development at Stony Brook, is educating high school and community college faculty in current concepts and laboratory techniques in biotechnology, 2) with the assistance of the biotechnology industry, innovative curricula are being developed at the high schools and community colleges, 3) academic year and summer programs are being established that allow faculty and students to gain hands-on experience at the participating institutions. Campus based teaching is being supplemented by off-campus electronically delivered curricula. All developed materials are being made available to other institutions via the LIGASE home page, publications and workshops. Additional activities stress the recruitment of underrepresented minorities and women. Imaginative approaches to broaden instructional capability, including teaching with representatives from both education and industry are also being emphasized. An ongoing outside evaluation allows for positive feedback, modification and change on a regular basis. The overarching structure is provided by the LIGASE Steering Committee, consisting of teachers, faculty and industry representatives.",
