 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624628 Gedney  In recent years, the speeds and densities of  semiconductor devices have increased dramatically, resulting in single chip devices with millions of transistors, digital devices operating  with clock speeds approaching 500 MHz, and microwave devices with operating frequencies upwards to 250.  In order to support such high speed devices,  the electronic packaging, namely, the electrical interconnect networks supporting the semiconductor devices,  must be miniaturized and their design optimized to maintain signal integrity.  Therefore, it is vital to develop rigorous methods to accurately analyze and design electrical interconnect networks of electronic packages.  This research effort will develop full wave analysis tools that this is capable of analyzing practical  large scale electronic packages for digital circuit and microwave circuit applications.  To this end, the principal objectives are: 1)  To provide the capability of full-wave electromagnetic field analyses of dense electronic packages.  2)  Develop explicit and implicit time-domain solutions of  Maxwell's equations specifically using  higher-order basis functions, and also utilizing Wavelet expansions.  3)  Develop a hybrid explicit/implicit solution of Maxwell's equations using the finite-difference time domain and finite-element time-domain methods.  4)  Extend the perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary condition to explicit and implicit time-domain schemes based on unstructured meshes.  5) Develop innovative parallel algorithms for implicit and explicit schemes for heterogeneous distributed multiprocessor computing environments, and for hybrid explicit/implicit methods.  6)  Establish industrial affiliates to mentor the practical applications of the full-wave simulation tools and to provide test beds for these tools to be applied in a design environment.  The teaching effort will initially focus on the modification existing courses in electromagnetics.  The objective of this effort is to provide an applied knowledge to  students through the use of interactive software toolboxes and the development of a case study library that can be presented for instructional purposes at the undergraduate and graduate level.  This will enable students to have a better physical understanding of electromagnetic field and wave interactions by being able to visualize understanding of electromagnetic field and wave interactions by being able to visualize  the physical phenomena in real world applications.  Furthermore, through case studies, students will be provided with a better applied knowledge of electromagnetics.  Finally, multiprocessor computers are reaching the point where they are becoming economical for industry and will be used more and more in engineering design.  However, only a select few engineers and computer scientists are trained on development of software on these platforms.  On of the goals will be to provide a course in the fundamentals on parallel computing, with hands on experience of parallel algorithm development using a number of platforms and paradigms.  This course will be cross-disciplinary and will provide a foundation and practical understanding of parallel algorithm development and parallel paradigms to engineering students at a number of Universities as well engineers in Industry in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. ***",
