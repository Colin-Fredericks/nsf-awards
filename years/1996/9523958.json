 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital audio and video are increasingly common as data that are  manipulated in computer and communication systems.  Current resource  allocation mechanisms for network-based multipoint information delivery are  static in nature and cannot support interactivity for each participant.  Point-to-point approaches can support interactivity but are inefficient for  scaling to a large number of participants.  Currently, no techniques have  demonstrated the ability to renegotiate and scale service parameters per  session in progress as required to adapt to differing terminal equipment  characteristics and network congestion.    The proposal addresses this problem through the definition of decomposable  service groups that permit aggregation of interactivity, terminal  characteristics, and levels of service scaling.  Interactivity implies the  availability of a unique service group.  A mechanism is proposed to  dynamically reassign elements to service groups based on changing  interactivity and session requirements.  Such a mechanism will allow the  adjustment of service quality based on cost, available resources, or  user-equipment characteristics, and will adapt to changing network loading.  The proposed approach applies the characteristics of end applications and  data storage requirements to the design of a data scaling mechanism.    Specific tasks of this research are to (1) formalize a model for  characterizing and aggregating service groups, (2) develop a protocol for  dynamic service aggregation, (3) identify a mapping for application  requirements to service groups and network quality of service, (4) the  establishment of a network access mechanism to support service degradation  and scaling for multiple sessions, and (5) the simulation, implementation,  and evaluation using established multipoint applications and multicast  protocols.",
