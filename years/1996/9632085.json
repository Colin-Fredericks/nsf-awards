 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632085    The long term goal of this project is to determine the total  DNA sequence of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome.  For the  next three years, the specific goal of this project is to  produce at least 8.5 Mb of finished sequences of DNA using a  two-pronged, BAC-based strategy for generating megabase  quantity of high quality genome sequence data.  One focus of  the strategy will be to perform single-pass sequencing from  the ends of BAC clones from a well-constructed genomic  library of Arabidopsis. The second focus will be on the  complete sequencing of BAC clones using a random shotgun  approach.  When each BAC has been completely sequenced and  assembled, the BAC contig sequence will be compared to the  database of BAC end sequences.  A BAC or BACs which have  minimal sequence overlap with the completed BAC will then be  selected for the next round of shotgun library construction  and sequencing.  By repeating this sequence/search process  after the completion of each BAC, a sequence-based map of  the minimal tiling path of Arabidopsis BACs will be  generated for the genome without requiring  a separate BAC  mapping effort.  The finished sequence data will be released  on TIGR's web site and in GenBank three months from the time  when work begins on the sequencing of each selected BAC.  Clones will be freely available through the Arabidopsis  Biological Resource Center at Ohio State.    This award is one of the three awarded by the triagency  (Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, and US  Department of Agriculture) Arabidopsis thaliana genome  research program.  The activity of this project will be  coordinated with the other groups engaged in large scale  sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome.  The results will  contribute to determining the overall strategy for the  completion of the sequence of the entire Arabidopsis genome.  More importantly, the information and data produced will be  useful to the general research community and will contribute  to rapid advances in pl ant biology.",
