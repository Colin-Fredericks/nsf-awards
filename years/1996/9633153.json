This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement study will examine the meaning and practice of fatherhood for these young men and explore how incarceration and parole affect their understanding of fatherhood and their ability to fulfill fatherhood responsibilities.  Particular focus will be placed on the areas of paternity establishment, child support, visitation, and in-kind support.  The study is also intended to explore variations in fathering patterns for different groups of young parolees.  It is expected that a number of factors, including race and education, are important in explaining differences in fathering attitudes and behaviors among parolees. The research questions will be approached by examining attitudes and experiences of white, black and Latino parolee fathers in the California Youth Authority System.  To collect data from the young men a multi-stage design will be employed. The stages will include observations in parenting classes, a probability survey, and in-depth interviews.  The data generated by this multi-method design will be conducive to both quantitative and qualitative analytic techniques.  The information obtained from this study will provide a broad understanding of fathering in a young parolee population.  ****  ??",
