 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this proposal is to develop an integrated approach for  increasing the dependability of parallel computers. For detection and diagnosis  of hardware faults at the local (node) level, this approach will combine off-line  built-in self testing, on-line concurrent checking, and software techniques  implementing path and algorithmic-based checks.  The aim of this proposal is to  develop a systematic method for generating and placing checks into the  implementation of an application. For automating the verification process and  placement of checks in programs, an interactive tool, VERIFY, will be developed.  For estimating the coverage factor provided by these techniques, a software  fault-injection tool will be created.  Efficient and fast reconfiguration  algorithms will be developed for avoiding single and multiple faulty nodes and  links. A user transparent software layer will be created for implementing the  proposed algorithms.  This will be written on top of the existing system software  that residents in every node of parallel computing systems.    The Software Object-Oriented Fault-Injection Tool (SOFIT) will be ported on the  nCUBE and Tandem SeverNet. The recovery time overhead will be estimated in the  presence of single and multiple faults injected by SOFIT into the nodes and links  of the nCUBE and SeverNet when programs are being executed. A dependability  evaluation study will be performed.  The objective of this research is to show  that this integrated approach can be used successfully for improving the  reliability of the nCUBE and SeverNet by an order of magnitude.",
