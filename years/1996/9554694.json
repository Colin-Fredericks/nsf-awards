 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to present faculty members with an  integrated methodology for teaching undergraduate control theory  and its application to a wide variety of mechatronic systems.  The  program combines the insight and understanding of classical control  (frequency domain) theory with the computational power of modern  control (time domain) theory.  Often, the tools of these two  domains are taught in separate sections of a course, or in separate  courses.  This need not be the case, as is demonstrated in our  undergraduate and graduate courses at Georgia institute of  Technology.  The GA Tech classroom approach will be integrated into  the mechatronics laboratory curriculum developed at RPI to provide  the students with the ability to realize their control designs on  inexpensive controllers. Through this course we will provide  faculty with the means to educate students such that they will  develop an excellent intuitive understanding of control theory, a  firm grasp on powerful computational tools currently available, and  the ability to physically implement these systems.  The integration  of theory, computer tools and laboratory experiences will yield an  educational opportunity for the students that far exceeds any  standard classroom experience currently taught.",
