The University of Texas at San Antonio    Research in Parallel Computer Systems Design using   Workstation Clusters with High-Speed Networks     This award is for the acquisition of a cluster of four multiprocessor  workstations to support several research projects, including the   research on the design of architectures and compilers for distributed   shared memory multiprocessors and on large-scale applications such as   the design and implementation of parallel discrete event simulators.   The proposed instrumentation provides a multi-granular parallel and   distributed computing platform, where both tightly-coupled and   loosely-coupled systems coexist. It interconnects four Sun workstations   with an SCI (scalable coherent interface) based high-speed network.   The SCI interconnect will provide low-latency message passing and   shared memory support. The SUN workstations with Solaris OS support   threads and high precision clocks. The low-latency inter-workstation   communication and threads will be used to implement parallel architecture   simulators and parallel discrete event simulators. Precise clocks will   be used to extract message communication and shared memory traces from   applications. These traces in turn will be used to evaluate the new   architectural mechanisms through simulations. The shared memory support provided by the interconnect will be used to run the parallel code   generated by a parallelizing compiler. Several benchmark applications   will be compiled and run on the equipment to evaluate the effectiveness   of various dependence analysis techniques.",
