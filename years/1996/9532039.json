 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 95-32039:  Wellner    This research involves the study of  empirical processes,  bootstrap methods in statistics, semiparametric models, and   inverse problems and nonstandard asymptotics.  The research will   involve limit theory for infinite - dimensional  M - estimates  and   related bootstrap methods, preservation theorems for uniform  Donsker   classes of functions, uniform in P bootstrap limit theorems,   estimation of monotone and convex functions, convergence of  iterative   convex minorant algorithms, and the behavior of global  functionals in   models with interval censoring.    %%%  For the analysis of failure time data which are subject to right   censoring and/or left truncation, many methods are now available.    However, in many biomedical studies, including those arising from    HIV/AIDS studies, failure times are censored or truncated in more    complicated ways.  One such complication is ``interval  censoring'',   in which one knows that the event of interest occurs within a  random   time interval, but not the exact timing: for example,  HIV  positivity   or the drop of the CD4 count below a certain threshold may only  be   determined to be between two clinical visits, but not the exact  time  may remain unknown.   This research will involve developing new   statistical method for data arising from these and other more   complicated censoring mechanisms ranging from animal   carcinogenesis experiments to data in sociology and   econometrics modelling.  A detailed study and evaluation    of the properties of methods recently proposed by other  statisticians   will be completed.   ***",
