(ABET)    Proposal Title: The Pilot Study for the Implementation of Engineering Criteria 2000    Abstract:  This project by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. (ABET) is a Pilot Study for the Implementation of Engineering Criteria 2000.  This is an outgrowth of a consensus building process to develop a reformed accreditation criteria that will maintain strong focus on quality and professional preparation while offering flexibility for major innovations in curricular design and delivery methods.  Engineering Criteria 2000 is a simplified, flexible set of outcome assessment based criteria that responds to the national call from leaders in industry, government, and academe for a reformed criteria.  The Pilot Study, leading to the implementation of Engineering Criteria 2000 in the Fall of 2001, consists of a series of workshops, structured reviews, and pilot accreditation visits.  Participants include institutional representatives such as deans, department heads, industry advisory representatives, faculty liaisons, and ABET representatives including team chairs, visiting teams, and members of the professional societies who work together to forge a reformed process for accreditation under Engineering Criteria 2000.  The Pilot Study will produce case studies and training materials covering such topics as the Development of Program Goals and Objectives, Assessment Plans, and Assessment Measurement and Tools suitable for a diverse spectrum of institutions and evaluators.",
