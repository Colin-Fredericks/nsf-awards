 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Michalowski  9634193  There has been an increase in interest in reinforced soil structures following the major seismic events in the U.S. and in Japan in the last few years. Reinforced soil structures appear to have performed very well during earthquakes, and showed little structural distress.    This project addresses the stability analysis of such structures. Both soil nailing and geosynthetic reinforcement are considered, and seismic loads, given as patterns of base acceleration, are accounted for.    Two major objectives are: (a) progress in understanding of soil reinforcement mechanisms, including some \"non-traditional\" synthetic reinforcement such as thin continuous filament, and (b) development of techniques for analysis and synthesis of soil structures reinforced with soil nails or geosynthetics, and presenting results in a manner useful for design practice.    The analysis is based on the theorems of plasticity theory. The contribution of soil nails or geosynthetics are accounted for through inclusion of additional work dissipation terms in the energy balance equation. An effort is made to investigate the influence of non-associativity of plastic flow of granular soils on the results of the stability analysis. The structural loads considered include self-weight, forces applied as boundary loads, and inertial forces due to seismic acceleration (base shaking).    This research will contribute to the state of knowledge in the area through development of a new analysis for stability of soil-nailed or geosynthetic-reinforced structures, and through development of a new approach to modeling of soils reinforced with continuous thread (filament). It will also contribute to engineering design practice. An effort will be made to create useful design charts.",
