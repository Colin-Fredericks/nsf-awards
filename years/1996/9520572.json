 "awd_abstract_narration": "9520572  BRYANT            The normal male karyotype of the housefly, Musca domestica,  consists of five pairs of autosomes and a pair of dimorphic sex  chromosomes.  Some males however have two X chromosomes and a portion of  the Y chromosome containing the male determining factor attached to one of  the third autosomes.  This new male karyotype which was rare or absent  fifty years ago is now found around the world and has replaced the normal  male karyotype in many populations.  Surveys suggest that the third  chromosome containing the translocated male determining factor decreases  with latitude and overall frequencies continue to increase with time.  Since genetic recombination is normally absent in male houseflies, the  third autosome containing the translocated male determining factor is  prevented from exchanging genetic material via crossing over.  Theory  predicts that this should result in the accumulation of mutations on this  chromosome causing it to diverge from normal third chromosomes.  This study  is concerned with determining how much the new male determining chromosome  in the housefly has changed since the acquisition of the male determining  factor.          This study will survey the frequency of the new male determining  chromosome from several different populations from around the U.S.  Strains  containing the translocated male determining factor on the third autosome  will be studied and compared in terms of the accumulation of deleterious  mutations, gene inactivation and dosage compensation.  The accumulation of  sexually antagonistic alleles associated with the new male determining  chromosome will also be investigated.",
