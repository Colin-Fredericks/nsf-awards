 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526628  Islam    The goal of this proposal is to investigate the space-time dynamics of land-surface processes on land-atmosphere interactions at the mesoscale.  The achieve this goal, a well coordinated observational data analysis and numerical modeling approach will be pursued.  Following are the main tasks of this research:  *Explore the use of MM5 as the atmospheric module to refine the coupled land-atmosphere model   *Compare the land surface response of the coupled land-atmosphere model with the FIFE data.  *Establish a spin-up time scale as a function of initial atmospheric states and initial land surface states.  Examine the dependence of spin-up time on the nature of forcing data.  *Develop a methodology to asses the effects of spatial heterogeneity on the response of near-surface atmospheric processes.  Evaluate the relationships between characteristic scales of variabilities in soil wetness and space time dynamics of evapotranspiration and near-surface atmospheric variables.  Identify the physical mechanisms that control the space-time scales of soil wetness anomalies.    This proposal is designed to characterize the space-time dynamics of land surface hydrology and atmospheric response by using a coupled land-atmosphere model and measured datasets from the FIFE and Washita '92 sites.  Resulting information from this research would provide the incremental knowledge needed for accurate interpretation and widespread application of mesoscale models and field experiments for land-atmosphere interaction studies.  They will aid in addressing the spin-up and scaling properties of mesoscale models and in developing realistic land-surface hydrology parameterizations for atmospheric models.  In addition, this effort is directly relevant to scaling of water and energy fluxes and testing and evaluation of coupled land-atmosphere model segments of the GCIP  GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) Continental-Scale International Project  and EOS (Earth Observing System) science plans.",
