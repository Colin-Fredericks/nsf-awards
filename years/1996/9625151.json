 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9625151     Foss    The general research goal of this Career proposal is to synthesize metal particles of sufficient  uniformity and complexity such that they engender optical behaviors heretofore unseen in  metal particle composite materials. This project deliberately targets particles whose  dimensions lie between ca. 5 nanometers (nm) and 50 nm. Metal particles within these limits  contain a sufficient number of atoms so as to possess bulk optical properties, but are small  enough that they do not scatter appreciably light at visible and longer wavelengths. The  synthetic work will focus specifically on three basic structural types: 1) cylindrical particles  composed of two or more different elemental subunits; 2) branched metal nanostructures; and  3) chiral nanostructures. Type 1 particles will be prepared via template synthesis, which  involves the electrodeposition of metals into the pores of anodic aluminum oxide films. The  template synthesis method will allow for electrochemical control of both cylinder radius and  length, as well as the sequence of the different metal layers of which the cylinder is  composed. Type 2 particles will be prepared in similar fashion to type 1, except that the  anodic alumina films will be grown using a voltage reduction regime that produces branched  pore structures. The preparation of chiral structures (Type 3) will involve the vacuum  deposition (at grazing incidence) of gold and other metals onto nanoscopic silver post  substrates prepared via template synthesis. Oxidation of the silver foundation will facilitate  release of the chiral particles into solution. Structural characterization of all particles will  involve transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and/or atomic force microscopy (AFM).  UV/Visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic studies of particles in all three types will  be done to assess the relationship between particle structure and plasmon resonance  absorption. Composite materials containing oriented particles of types  1 and 2 which have  been prepared so as to lack inversion symmetry will also be evaluated for bulk second  harmonic generation (SHG). Solutions containing type 3 particles are expected to exhibit  optical activity, and will thus be examined using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.  %%%  This project is concerned with the application of template synthesis methods to prepare  nanoscopic metal particles of unprecedented geometric and compositional complexity. By virtue  of their complexity, these particles are expected to exhibit optical behaviors that are normally  considered the sole province of molecular entities. The project will lead to a more detailed  understanding of the relationship between metal particle structure and composite optical  properties. Furthermore, as some of the anticipated properties have not been observed previously  to arise from gross particle asymmetry, this project may also lead to new applications of  nanoscopic metal particles. Relatedly, since the proposed synthetic strategies are based primarily  on chemical and electrochemical methods (as opposed to photo- and electron beam  lithographies), they will be easily available to many research groups.",
