The focus of these conferences has changed from year to year as this rapidly moving field has progressed. The fifth conference is entitled \"Plant Developmental Genetics\" and will be held from August 10-15, 1996 at Vermont Academy in Saxton's River, VT. Much of the recent progress in plant development has occurred as a result of the use of classical genetic approaches to identify genes involved in various developmental processes, followed by a molecular analysis of these genes. This meeting will summarize recent advances in this exciting area of plant biology. The sessions will carry us through the plant life cycle starting with gametogenesis and ending with reproduction. Woven through the sessions will be a consideration of the cellular, molecular and environmental factors that regulate plant morphogenesis. Although much of the recent work in this area has been carried out on Arabidopsis and maize, other systems -- including ferns, petunia, snapdragon, tomato, pea and the algae, Fucus and Acetabularia -- have  also made significant contributions. Each of these systems has unique advantages for studying particular aspects of the plant life cycle. The invited speakers include both young and established investigators. Additional speakers will be drawn from attendees on the basis of submitted abstracts. Ample use will also be made of poster presentations. By bringing together investigators studying these different systems, the organizers hope to facilitate the exchange of ideas and information between scientists who otherwise might not interact.  ***",
