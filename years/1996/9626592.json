(1) Is  there  a simple C*-algebra that contains   both finite and infinite nonzero projections? (2) Determine the   K-theory of the simple C*-algebras generated by the reduced group   C*-algebras associated with free products of cyclic groups and   certain projections, and simple C*-algebras generated by a   weighted bilateral shift and an isometry. (3) Classifying these   non-nuclear, purely infinite, simple C*-algebras up to isomorphism.   The problem (1) is an outstanding problem  in the theory of simple   C*-algebras and the program of  classifying separable simple   C*-algebras. The proposer intends to attack this  problem by some   techniques in the associated multiplier algebras. The C*-algebras   in (2) and (3) include non-nuclear, purely infinite, simple   C*-algebras which might serve as  standard models in  certain   classes of non-nuclear simple C*-algebras.  Investigation on  the   structure of these C*-algebras will supplement the expansion of   classification program to the category of non-nuclear simple   C*-algebras.  Encouraged by the interests of several leading   researchers on the projects above,  the proposer expects that   this investigation will stimulate fruitful research activities   on  the subjects.              The collection of all linear transformations in the three   dimensional space, and in any finite dimensional space,  is generated    by translations and certain rotations (via  addition, scalar   multiplication, and composition). This collection is the basic   example of simple C*-algebras and can be identified with the algebra of all   square matrices. These elementary simple C*-algebras are fully   classified by the dimension of the space.  Many problems in the   quantum physics and in modern technologies (for example, computer   programming) are reduced  to the investigation of simple C*-algebras   of this sort, and more generally, a variety of simple C*-algebras   generated by certain linear transformations in the infinite dimensional   space.  The proposed project is concerned with the structure of   simple C*-algebras generated by some square matrices of infinite   size. In the process of increasing knowledge about these simple   C*-algebras, one important step is to understand their structure   and then to classify them. The proposed project is  especially   concerned with studying invariants that distinguish these algebras.   The classical dimension is no longer the distinguishing invariant,   and thus, finding and studying new distinguishing invariants   become two key problems. The proposed project aims at attacking these  outstanding problems in this area.",
