 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chaos is the generic term used to describe the irregular and  unpredictable time evolution of physical systems.  In classical  mechanics, chaos may be defined in terms of the behavior of  nearby particle trajectories.  Since classical mechanics can be  thought of as a special case of quantum mechanics, it is of  interest to know how the irregularity of a classically chaotic  system, influences the dynamics of the corresponding quantum  system.  One of the trade marks of quantum mechanics is the  quantization of energy levels.  It now seems apparent that chaos  manifests itself in the distribution of the energy levels.  A  distribution of energy levels presupposes that the energy levels  are discrete.  However, if the electron is nearly stripped from  its nucleus, the widths of the energy level spacings essentially  go to zero and the energies become continuous.  Continuous  energies are also present in unbound quantum systems like the  model studied in this project, the Hydrogen atom in an external  magnetic field which is perpendicular to an electric field.  This  work will address how one looks for signatures of chaos in this  model.  We plan to check the validity of the meaning of the  energy level distribution in an important energy range that has  not been previously investigated.",
