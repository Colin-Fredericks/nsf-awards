 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past ten years the Harvard Forest has developed an  integrated and cross-disciplinary research and educational  program involving researchers and students from across the  northeastern U.S. that focuses on the response of forest  ecosystems to disturbance and stress resulting from natural  and anthropogenic processes.  This program is structured  around six approaches:  (1) reconstructive studies; (2) long-  term measurement and observation; (3) experimental  manipulations; (4) controlled environment studies; (5)  integration of results within our research group and  collaboratively with other research groups; and (6)  application of results to policy issues in natural resource  management, conservation biology, and human health and  environment.  The pressing need for expanded new facilities  to accommodate the growing numbers of visiting scientists  and students led to the development of a ten-year plan for  the renovation and construction of additional laboratories,  office space, archival facilities, housing, and computer  telecommunications and networking systems.  With support  from Harvard University and NSF, this plan has been  substantially accomplished.  The remaining major project is  the development of housing and meeting space for visiting  students and researchers.  A recent gift of property  directly contiguous to the main Harvard Forest buildings  presents the opportunity to complete this final element in  our ten-year plan.  The property consists of one large house  (the Fisher House with 13 bedrooms and 5 baths), a  caretaker's cottage, outbuildings and 20 ha of forest land.  due to its large size, ideal location and solid  construction, the Fisher House represents a perfect  opportunity for the development of free-standing  accommodations that are desperately needed for our large  visitor and collaborator groups.  This project will renovate  and restore this facility for educational and research  purposes using joint funding from Harvard University and  NSF>  The comp leted structure will greatly enhance science  and education in ecology by increasing our capability to  serve and to integrate the diverse array of students,  researchers, and visitors who comprise our extended  community.  This facilities development will also directly  improve research operations for collaborating scientists by  removing non-research uses (i.e. housing) from our main  office, laboratory and administrative building (Shaler Hall)  and freeing up approximately 2300 sq. ft of new office and  work space in ten rooms in Shaler Hall.",
