The  project  hypothesis is that stratification in the oceans,  although often transient, has led to the development of a  limited number of physiologically and genetically distinct  and recognizable groups (\"species\") of cyanobacteria  specifically adapted to the high light, low nutrient mixed  layer and others adapted to the higher nutrient, low light  life below it. Even this simple scenario is much more  complex than the current oceanographic paradigm. There is  currently little knowledge of the spatial or temporal  variations in natural cyanobacterial diversity, and we can  only guess at the factors that may be driving it. The  importance this diversity may have in determining  oceanographic rate processes, such as in situ growth or  carbon fixation rates, is unknown, and its role cannot  really be addressed until we understand the extent and  patterns of cyanobacterial diversity. This project is the  first step in being able to assay the growth rates and  metabolic activities of individual physiological or genetic  types. Since similar genetic and physiological processes  probably also occur in other groups of phytoplankton, these  questions are of general significance to biological  oceanography.    This project will also begin to look at not just the number  of microbial \"species\" in an environment, but why that  number? The microbiota of the marine environment are coming  to be seen as remarkably diverse, and an understanding of  the processes underlying this diversity will best be gained  by examining the diversification of a related group of  microorganisms in detail in relationship to physiochemical  parameters. The marine environment is probably the best  place to begin to understand these questions because there  is also considerable experience in understanding the  physiochemical gradients surrounding the o rganisms. RNA  polymerase gene sequences from strains and bulk community  samples, flow cytometric analyses, pigment analyses,  antibody assays for motile Synechococcus and other strains,  strain isolation techniques, physiological studies on  nitrogen and light utilization, and physiochemical data will  be the initial set of tools we will bring to these problems,  with others under development. Three sites in the  oligotrophic boundary of the Southern California Bight will  be sampled at several depths for two consecutive years at  the same season to ensure the reproducibility of our  conclusions. A third cruise will focus on characterizing the  same sites at a different season in order to begin to  explore temporal variations in diversity. This focused  sampling effort will ensure a tractable approach to  understanding the importance of cyanobacterial diversity to  marine ecosystems.  ***",
