The slenderness ratios of these columns will be  selected so that both modes of failures, global buckling and  local buckling will be investigated in this study.  In the experimental investigation, full-scale specimens will  be prepared from commercially available pultruded sections.  The experimental work will be conducted in two phases.  In  the first phase, 32 different specimens will be prepared from  wide flange and structural tubing sections, and they will be  loaded to failure by means of a concentric axial load.  In  the second phase of this program, 24 specimens made of  similar sections used in Phase I will be loaded axially for a  period of 10,000 hours.  The sustained loads will be  calculated based on 40%, 50%, and 60% of the ultimate loads  obtained in the first phase of the study.  Based on the experimental findings and on basic stability  theory and anisotropic materials, a unified limit state  design criteria for FRP columns will be developed.  Guidelines and code-like design provisions will be suggested  as an initial Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) method  similar to that which has recently been developed for timber,  cold-formed steel, and masonry structures.***",
