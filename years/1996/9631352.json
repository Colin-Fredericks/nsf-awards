 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:   CTS-9631352     Principal Investigator:  Johari     This is grant to support a collaborative effort between Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Physical Sciences Inc. to investigate the concept of vortex generator jets for turbulent boundary layer control.  Detailed flow visualization experiments will be performed to probe the near field of a pulsed vortex generator jet embedded in a turbulent boundary layer.  Studies will be made in both a water tunnel and a wind tunnel.  Data obtained from this study will be used to model the interaction of the pulsing jet and the boundary layer flow.  Information  of this type will be useful in developing improved boundary layer control systems with a variety of applications including flow control on airliner wings.  The project will utilize experimental facilities at Physical Sciences and WPI.   This research has the potential to significantly enhance the performance of jet injection vortex generators in comparison to conventional vane generators that have inherently higher parasite drag. The concept is quite important to the success of MEMS technology. The blending of the academic and industrial research facilities greatly enhances the overall capability for carrying  out the proposed research.  This project will be cost shared with Physical Sciences Inc. under the GOALI program.",
