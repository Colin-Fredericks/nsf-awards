 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chan  9626755       The investigator and his colleagues study computational  mathematics issues in nonlinear diffusion models in image  processing.  These problems are computationally intensive and  accurate and efficient methods are needed.  Traditionally, the  standard methods involve computation in the frequency domain,  facilitated by efficient FFT and wavelet algorithms.  Recently,  there has been a new movement towards a partial differential  equation (PDE) based approach, which is motivated by a more  systematic approach to restoring images with sharp edges, as well  as for image segmentation.  The image is diffused (denoised)  according to a nonlinear anisotropic diffusion PDE, designed to  diffuse less near edges.  Moreover, the PDEs are designed to  possess certain desirable geometrical properties such as affine  invariance and causality.  From a computational standpoint, the  PDE formulations call for new computational techniques that are  different from the traditional frequency domain and algebraic  approaches.  As yet, the nonlinear diffusion models are considered  somewhat expensive compared to traditional methods, and it is one  of the goals of this project to make them more efficient while  retaining their desirable geometric properties.  Additionally,  attempts are made to improve and extend these methods to color  and other vector-valued images.  Specific computational algorithms  being studied include primal-dual minimization methods,  preconditioning techniques, and wavelet algorithms.       Image processing has many important applications in both the  physical and the medical sciences.  In the current revolution in  communication and the advent of the information highway, more  and more images are being transmitted and better mathematical  algorithms are needed to compress and remove noise and other  distortions occurring in the transmission.  Applications in the  medical sciences and biotechnology field range from computer  topography to processing of microscopic images of  molecular  structures.  In the environmental area, satellite imaging has been  used to map natural resources as well as environmental pollution.  In the area of manufacturing, imaging systems are used to detect  defects automatically.  In all of these applications, a key  process is that of image restoration, namely, cleaning up an  image polluted by noise and blurring.  This is the main subject of  this project.  These problems are very computationally intensive  due to the large number of pixels and the possibility of  sequences of images (e.g. videos), solving them requires clever  mathematical algorithms as well as high performance computers.",
