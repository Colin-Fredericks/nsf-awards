Project funding will enable Dr.  Kudaravalli to spend one year in Japan, resident at Nihon  University, in order to investigate the thermal and fluid  dynamics phenomena for design of cryogenic pulse tube cooler  components for optimum performance. Dr. Kudaravalli has  previously investigated the heat transfer, fluid dynamics  and thermodynamic aspects of various cryogenic systems in  general and heat exchangers and regenerators of cryocoolers  including pulse tube coolers in particular. Professor  Matsubara is one of the leading researchers in the pulse  tube cryocooler area. He has pushed the technology further  by multistaging of the cooler and by invention of the  regenerative tube. Professor Matsubara's demonstration of  liquid helium temperatures (3.6 K) is the record low  temperature ever produced by a pulse tube cryocooler. Dr.  Kudaravalli will combine his expertise with that of  Professor Matsubara to study the thermal and fluid dynamics  phenomena in cryogenic pulse tube coolers achieving optimum  performance.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of advanced cryogenic cooler  technology. The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to  become familiar with research techniques, equipment and  facilities at AERI while contributing to the overall  research effort. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the  objectives of the program in its exchange and transfer of  scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.  ***",
