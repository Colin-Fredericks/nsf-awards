Although most ice core research has been in polar regions, ice cores from high elevations in the Americas have also provided unique and detailed insights into paleoclimates of the past, and this workshop will build on the analysis which has been carried out in the past.  The workshop will bring together interested parties from different research institutions in the region:  Argentina; Bolivia; Brazil; Canada; Chile; Ecuador; Peru; and the United States.  The primary goal of the workshop is to prepare a document outlining the opportunities that ice core studies in the high mountains of the Americas can provide in understanding ENSO-related interannual variability and cold region processes.  The is goal will be achieved by:  identifying the principal scientific questions which can be answered by ice core studies; determining which ice caps have the potential of yielding high resolution paleoenvironmental records; prioritizing the most important sites; planning preparatory glaciological and geophysical surveys to determine in detail the optimum coring sites; establishing which research institutions and individuals have the necessary technical and analytical skills and the motivation to carry out the required work; determining what funding would be required to carry out the proposed research and to establish a time-frame for accomplishing the work; and developing a plan for inter-institutional exchange of scientists and graduate students to ensure that the research program is truly collaborative, international, and multidiscilplinary.  These objectives will contribute to the study of a IAI research priority which is to what extent climate variability in the two hemispheres is synchronous.    The workshop  will identify institutions and individuals and their relevant expertise to assign areas of responsibility for subsequent research. A prioity list of sites where research should be initiated will also be prepared in order to build on existing knowledge or new areas for reconnaissance studies.  Workshop participants will discuss what mechanisms currently exist or will be required to ensure that the proposed research will be carried out in the framework of full international collaboration.  %%%  The purpose of this workshop on Climate Variability in the Americas from High Elevation Ice Cores is to develop plans for obtaining a set of ice cores from sites distributed along the mountainous western axis of the Americas, from Alaska/Yukon to the southern tip of South America.

Climatic variations of the last 2000 years are of particular relevance to contemporary human endeavors.  Although climatic fluctuations over this time period were small in comparison with those expected from a doubling of greenhouse gases, the last 2000 years have witnessed the most extreme condition of the Holocene period.  Furthermore, there is abundant evidence that even such relatively small climatic anomalies have had significant impacts on human societies such as prolonged droughts and other climate-related disruptions.  It is necessary to  understand these fluctuations and their causes and interactions between one region and another because it is the background of natural variability that the anthropogenic greenhouse effect is being impaired.  Climate-related proxy records can provide the longer time frame necessary to document the significance of underlying trends, to analyze the nature of any periodicities in climate, and to address the critical issues of abrupt climate change.  A long-term, detailed record of global climate is thus an essential pre-requisite of placing contemporary climatic conditions in perspective, and this proposal will construct high resolution proxy records from the Americas to construct a globally comprehensive view of such climatic variations in the past.    This proposal assembles a team of scientists from the following countries: Argentina; Bolivia; Brazil; Canada; Chile; Ecuador; Peru; and the United States.  These countries are Member States of the IAI, an initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global change issues among the scientific institutions of the Americas.  The National Science Foundation is the designated U.S. Government agency to carry our the Unites States responsibilities within the IAI.  ***",
