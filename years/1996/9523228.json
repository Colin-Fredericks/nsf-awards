It is comprised of three components. The  first project is concerned with Porphyritic Molecular  Metals. Quasi one-dimensional metals based on  metallophthalocyanines and related macrocycles show  properties without parallel in other classes of molecular  metals. The new materials will be used to study the  fundamental question of electron localization associated  with a lD - 3D crossover transition, and a novel M-I-M  transition seen at low temperatures and high pressure. The  second project deals with Magnetically Ordered Charge-  Transfer Salts. The aim is to explore the mechanism for  interstack ferromagnetic exchange and to examine the  detailed character of the magnetically ordered state in  molecular magnets. The third project is connected to  Conductors and Magnets From Functionalized Porphyrazines.  Breakthroughs in the synthesis of functionalized  porphyrazines provide the foundation for a long-term program  to prepare new classes of crystalline molecular metals and  magnets derived from porphyrazine (tetraazaporphyrin)-based  multi-metallic complexes, and new types of highly  processable metal-linked ribbon polymers.  %%%  This research program is devoted to the synthesis and  characterization of novel conductive and magnetic materials,  both crystalline and polymeric, that are based on metal-  organic complexes. It is comprised of three components: 1)  studies of Porphyritic Molecular Metals; 2) examinations of  Magnetically Ordered Charge-Transfer Salts; and 3)  investigation of Conductors and Magnets From Functionalized  Porphyrazines. The successful completion of this research  will eventually result in the development of new conductors  and magnets.",
