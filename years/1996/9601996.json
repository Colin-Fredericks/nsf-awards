 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601996  This award provides support for the Mid-America Drosophila  Stock Center at Bowling Green University.  The center  maintains a large collection of mutant strains of  the fruit  fly Drosophila melanogaster, an organism widely used in  basic investigations of genetics and developmental biology.  On request, samples of  mutant strains are provided  for use  in research and education.  The collection was originally  established in 1960 at the Institute for Cancer Research in  Philadelphia using strains from the personal collections of  H.J. Mueller and J. Shultz.  The collection moved to Bowling  Green University in 1996 and, since then, has grown to  include over 4,000 strains isolated by a number different  investigators.  During the period of this award, it is  expected that the most useful strains will be shifted to a  similar, but larger,  NSF-supported collection at the  Indiana University.   This merging of the two collections is  expected to increase the effectiveness with which collection  holdings are made available to the research community in the  future.",
