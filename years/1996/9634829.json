 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634927  Leckie  This project is to study the fundamental aspects of joints in  metal (MMC) and ceramic (CMC) matrix composite structures.  The  research philosophy emphasizes the understanding of the  underlying mechanics and its relationship to microstructure and  processing.  The research approach is based on the design,  manufacturing, characterization and analysis of relatively simple  joint geometries which allow the study of individual features of  the physical problem and its underlying mechanisms, e.g. the  strength of the interfaces defined by the fiber ends and the  associated debond process.  The MMC research will focus on  aluminum alloys reinforced with polycrystalline alumina fibers  while the CMC joints will be fabricated by vacuum infiltration of  multi-alumina slurries into polycrystalline alumina fiber cloth  arranged in layers with prescribed discontinuities.  The  microstructure and delamination resistance of these joints can be  modified by suitable control of the sintering temperature and  other manufacturing parameters.  The emphasis will be identifying  the relevant mechanisms and their relationship to processing via  microstructure and defects.  ***",
