The work  is the mathematical analysis part of an ongoing project, jointly  with J. L. Lions (College de France) and R. Temam (Indiana  University); that project involves a combination of modeling,  mathematical theory, and scientific computing.  Among the partial  differential equations are the core equations in climatology such  as the primitive equations of the atmosphere-only, the  ocean-only, and the coupled atmosphere/ocean systems.  Part of  the mathematical theory has been attained in previous work about  these core equations of the atmosphere, ocean and coupled  atmosphere-ocean.  A large amount of work such as the existence  and properties of strong solutions and long time behavior remains  to be done, however.  Also, the mathematical analysis of sea ice  equations and some free surface models is also addressed.  Another  part of the proposed work is to justify from the mathematical  viewpoint the geostrophic asymptotics and the associated  quasi-geostrophic equations (well-posedness and long time  dynamics).       The phenomena of the atmosphere and ocean are extremely rich  in organization and complexity.  The study of these complicated  phenomena and the relevant scientific issues are very challenging  and necessitate a joint effort of scientists in many fields.  The  proposed work takes up this study from the mathematical point of  view.  As is now well-known and as pointed out by John von Neumann  in the fifties, understanding and prediction of the weather and  climate involve a great deal of mathematical analysis and a great  deal of calculation.  This project aims at a better understanding  of the mechanisms of the turbulent behavior of the air and  seawater, as well as tools for better prediction of the weather  and possible global change.",
