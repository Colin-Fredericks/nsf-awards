 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the   Chemistry Division, Shaka will develop a new pulsed nuclear magnetic   resonance (NMR) technique called excitation sculpting.  Strong DC   magnetic pulsed field gradients (PFGs) will be used in conjunction with   frequency sweeps to eliminate out-of-band signals, revealing the desired   excitation profile and resulting in significant advantages compared to   conventional pulse shaping.  Preliminary results show effective water   suppression using the new technique, in which protons bound to carbon-12   nuclei are suppressed without loss of the desired signal from protons   bonded to a carbon-13.  Combined with superior carbon-13 decoupling,   superb high-resolution absorption-mode proton multiplets are obtained.    Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is one of the most useful tools   in the chemist's arsenal.  Techniques are constantly being developed   which allow this method to be applied to more problems, so that more   information can be extracted from NMR spectra with respect to such varied   systems as inorganic materials and biologically important molecules.  The   excitation sculpting method being developed in this work is expected to   have a large impact on most important NMR experiments, including some   `routine` experiments carried out in NMR facilities everywhere.",
