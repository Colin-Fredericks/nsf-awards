 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Great Lakes Center of Buffalo State College requests funds to  develop the laboratoryinstNmentation for experiments on the  bioenergetics, physiology and behavior of freshwater fish and plankton.  The experiments conducted with these instNments will be coupled to our  existing modeling programs in fish bioenergetics, spatial modeling of  habitat quality, 3-D foraging models and individual-based models of  fish populations and ecosystems. The new laboratory equipment will  provide a tight coupling and feedback between laboratory  experimentation and model development that will produce an integrated  empirical and theoretical approach to studying freshwater ecosystems.          The core equipment enhancement requested in this proposal is a  computer controlled water quality control system for bioenergetics,  behavior and physiology experiments and for culturing and maintenance  of fish and plankton in the laboratory. The Great Lakes Center of  Buffalo State College has the only modern Aquatic Research Laboratory  (opened 1994) located on the lower Great Lakes (ol Lake Erie) capable  of supporting experimental aquatic research with lake water. The  Aquatic Research Laboratory is a new 7,000+ sq. ft. facility equipped  with fish and zooplankton culture rooms, experimental laboratories with  flow-through water systems (well water and lake water), a workshop,  classroom, biological sorting center and direct access to Lake Erie.  Experimental work at the Aquatic Research Laboratory has suffered from  an inability to maintain water temperature and water quality at levels  required for bioenergetics, behavioral and physiological experiments.          Equipment for laboratory experimental facilities is requested to  collect detailed, speciesspecific data required for studies of  freshwater ecosystems and for the associated modeling efforts. The  equipment will provide facilities needed for experiments on metabolic  rates, consumption rates, predator-prey interactions, reactive  distances, and  physiological responses to stress in both fish and  plankton. These data will provides full sets of parameter values for  species-specific models (bioenergetics, foraging, etc.) and eliminate  the need to \"borrow\" data from unrelated species in model development.  In addition, the data will allow for measures of fish and plankton  physiological responses to changes in environmental conditions that may  occur naturally or result form anthropogenic effects on the ecosystem.          The instrumentation we have requested will add to the Great Lakes  Center's Aquatic Research Laboratory by enhancing our training of  students (undergraduate and graduate) and researchers (postdoctoral and  visiting research scientists). Research training programs will benefit  by adding a laboratory experimentation component to our already strong  field and modeling programs. The Great Lakes Center has recently begun  the only Graduate Program in Great Lakes Environmental Sciences in the  country, and the requested laboratory facility would be a fertile  training ground for students enrolled in this program. In 1995 the  Great Lakes Center hosted visiting scientists from Canada, Israel, and  other institutions within New York to train them on the techniques we  have developed for integrating our field sampling and spatial modeling  programs. The laboratory instrumentation will provide a sorely needed  component to the Great Lakes Center Aquatic Research Laboratory for  training and research on freshwater ecosystems.",
