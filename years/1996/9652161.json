 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the influx of an increasingly diverse, often under-prepared student body,  institutions of higher education have not sufficiently reassessed and revised their  curricula and teaching methodologies in Science, Math, Engineering and Technology to  accommodate the varying cultural backgrounds and levels of preparedness of these  students. All too often students' first encounter with college level work in these  challenging areas is through classes taught in a lecture-format in which little or no  attention is paid to encouraging active learning, attending to differing learning needs or to  exploring the human and social dimensions of science and technology. As a result,  students can become indifferent or hostile to these fields, avoiding further SMET work.  This problem is further complicated by the fact that students who do persevere beyond an  initial course are not afforded a consistent, coherent, interconnected education as they  move among the various SMET courses.                The University of Hartford's reform proposal aims to attract more students,  particularly female and minority students, to SMET fields by improving teaching and  learning in introductory courses as well as by fostering increased curricular and  pedagogical coordination and consistency within SMET disciplines particularly within  the first years. Employing a synergistic combination of innovative teaching practices  and technologies, faculty will reform entry level SMET courses. The objective of these  reforms is to create environments in which students engage in collaborative learning  projects, work in groups with specially trained peers, and employ appropriate educational  technologies that increase interactivity and foster intellectual synthesis. Within the two-  year period of the grant 10 to 12 introductory SMET courses (offered in four colleges of  the University) will be transformed. Furthermore, the project will create a strong cross-  collegiate framework within SMET disciplines for facult y collaboration and professional  development,                The reform builds upon and integrates five highly successful programs already in  place at the University of Hartford. The first is the reform of \"gateway\" mathematics  courses in the College of Arts and Sciences to incorporate the use of graphing calculators,  applications based exercises, group work, and peer facilitation. The second is a program  for women in SMET funded by the US. Department of Education at Hartford College for  Women. In supportive classroom cultures, women engage in collaborative learning;  outside of the classroom they attend \"metacognitive sessions \" which nurture scientific  thinking and study skills applicable to SMET fields, while combating culturally induced  anxieties about working in these fields. The third is a faculty development project for  innovative pedagogies in the natural sciences sponsored by the Keck/PKAL which  introduced science faculty to collaborative and problem-based learning techniques,  effective interactive multimedia tools, and pedagogical methods most responsive to the  needs of women students. The fourth innovation is the College of Engineering's   reconceptualization of its first-year curriculum to include work in teams on small scale,  practice-oriented research projects and experience with current technologies. Finally, the  Advanced Education Computing Grant funded by FIPSE has trained a cadre of faculty  (70 by the end of AY 1996) in the authoring and use of interactive multimedia in the  classroom in order to foster student-centered learning.                The University expects to develop a national model of excellence in SMET  education at small comprehensive universities; this model will enhance consistency and  coherence of students' experience of science, encourage student-centered learning  experiences, foster greater student success in introductory SMET courses, and encourage  increased persistence among students in pursuing further SMET work. Its uniqueness  stems fr om a realistic assessment of the process of change, experience with successful  small scale change initiatives, and institution-wide commitment to reexamining the first  year experience and reallocating resources to introductory level courses and support  services.",
