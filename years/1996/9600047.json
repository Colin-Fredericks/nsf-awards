 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600047  Roselli      Steroid hormones are integral modulators of neural communication  and development.  These simple molecules, acting as hormones, have  the potential to influence all neural functions from initiation of  neural development to the activity of individual synapses in  adults.  Recent advances in knowledge about non-genomic actions of  steroid hormones, the involvement of non-neuronal elements in  reproductive function and the role of steroid hormones on neural  organization, have had striking effects on neuroendocrine  physiology, neuronal cell biology, reproductive physiology and  non-reproductive behaviors such as learning and memory, aging,  aggression, feeding and emotion.  This action will provide support  for a Young Investigator Symposium to be held at the 1996 Workshop  on Steroid Hormones and Brain Function in Breckenridge, CO on March  30-April 3, 1996.  This workshop brings together scientists using  different approaches to address important and timely issues  concerning steroid hormone and growth factor involvement in brain  function.  Molecular biologists, neuroanatomists,  neurophysiologists and behavioral scientists will discuss issues  such as neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of estrogen, the  neurobiology of androgenic anabolic steroids, functions of  G-protein linked steroid hormone receptors, and steroids and  reproductive behaviors.  These are fundamentally important  questions in a field that is rapidly changing and advancing.  The  inclusion of the Young Investigator Symposium will provide a  mechanism to foster young scientists and facilitate collaborative  efforts that may significant enhance our understanding of basic  neurobiological mechanisms.",
