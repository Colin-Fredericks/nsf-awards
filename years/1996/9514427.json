 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514427  ASHBY    This research will investigate the perceptual and cognitive  processes used in the identification and categorization of  complex perceptual stimuli.  The research program will develop  and test a new theory that assumes category learning is a  competition between two separate categorization systems.  One  system uses rules that can be described verbally and has access  to consciousness (i.e., the verbal system), whereas the other can  learn rules that are impossible to describe verbally (i.e., the  implicit system).  The theory will be described at three  different levels.  A neuropsychological version will provide a  detailed description of the major brain areas and neural pathways  used by the separate systems and that mediate the competition  between the systems.  In addition, two separate mathematical  descriptions of the theory will be developed.  One will provide a  global level description of the dynamical behavior that the  theory predicts should occur when people learn new categories.   The other will provide a more detailed description that can be  used to predict trial-by-trial category learning behavior.  Many  experiments will be conducted to test novel predictions of the  theory.  In addition to making predictions about category  learning in normal human adults, the theory also makes specific  predictions for children, the elderly, patients suffering from  major depression and from diseases of the basal ganglia (e.g.,  Parkinson's and Huntington's disease), and for nonhuman animals.   This research will improve our understanding of one of the most  basic and important of cognitive processes, namely  categorization.  It also has the potential to increase our  understanding of the cognitive effects of several major diseases  and disorders, and of how cognition is affected by normal aging  processes.  This project will combine extensive experimentation  with theoretical investigations that rely heavily on mathematical  modeling techniques and recent discoveries in th e neurosciences.    ***",
