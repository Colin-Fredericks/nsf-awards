Renowned  researches and consultants from Latin America, the United  States and Europe with present state-of-the-art R&R  technology to an audience consisting of professionals,  academics and students from Latin America.  They will meet to  discuss research priorities and potential collaborative  projects.  The seminar will focus on state of practice, current research  and future developments in the repair and rehabilitation of  concrete structures with steel reinforcement.  Prevention and  remediation techniques for corrosion mechanisms will be given  special attention.  The interaction among experts from  different countries climates environmental conditions and  practices, but who face similar problems, will allow useful  exchanges of information, help to set effective research  priorities, and stimulate collaborative projects.  The  participants will also have the unique opportunity of  examining the R&R work on one of the first and longest cable-  stayed concrete bridges in the world, the Maracaibo Bridge.  The seminar papers, the discussions and the proceedings will  provide for effective technology transfer.  The event will be  a valuable opportunity to link participants and institutions  from the Americas.***",
