 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633107 Boone  This project address a key issue, p-type doping in II-VI semiconductors, utilizing nuclear reactions and homoepitaxy to prepare thin film crystalline ZnSe with As dopant atoms 'trapped' at Se lattice sites.  The approach is based on growth of ZnSe using isotopically enriched 74Se exposed to thermal neutrons before growth to allow the doping process to be decoupled from crystal growth, and other processes which can lead to compensation effects. The idea is that most of the resulting 75Se will decay to As after growth is completed, and ZnSe will have been synthesized by a process 'guaranteeing' substitutional As doping. The aim of the research is to provide unique material to gain fundamental insight into fundamental doping mechanisms in II-VI materials. %%% The project is multidisciplinary combining fundamental materials physics and materials processing studies with advanced characterization tools and analysis methods to address basic issues in a topical area of high scientific value and potential technological benefits.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level important to several aspects of advanced electronic/photonic device fabrication and operation.  The knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
