 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Office of Special Projects in the the Chemistry   Division  in support of the research of Dr. Catherine Page at the   University of Oregon. The research deals with the design, synthesis and   characterization of self-assembled inorganic/organic multilayer thin   films. Two specific areas will be investigated: (1) the incorporation of   nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophores into metal bisphosphonate   multilayers, both as new  NLO films, and as a diagnostic tool for    assessing orientational order and kinetics of monolayer formation; and,   (2) the synthesis of new hybrid multilayer films based on transition   metal diisocyanide coordination complexes. In the latter system, the role   of solvent, transition metal and diisocyanide structure will be explored.   Synthesis and dynamics of metal diisocyanide multilayers and hybrid   multilayers of metal diisocyanide and metal bisphosphonates will be   investigated. Multilayers will be characterized by FTIR, grazing angle   x-ray diffraction, ellipsometry and XPS. Additionally, the orientational   order of the layers and the kinetics of monolayer formation will be   determined by second harmonic generation measurements.  This research has elements of both fundamental importance and commercial   relevance. Incorporation of nonlinear optical chromophores into   self-assembled films provide a means of addressing fundamental issues of   film orientation and growth. Additionally, multilayer structures with   nonlinear optical properties offer the prospect of applications in   electrooptic conversion, optical switching and frequency doubling   devices.",
