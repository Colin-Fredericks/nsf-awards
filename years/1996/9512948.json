 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for three ultracentrifuges (Beckman L7-80) and  eight ultracentrifuge rotors (two each of NVT65, 60Ti, SW-55Ti, and  SW-41Ti) to be located in the molecular biology core facility that  serves laboratories in the three departments of Biology, Molecular  Biology and Biochemistry, and Chemistry at Wesleyan University. The  ultracentrifuges will replace two instruments that have recently become  non-operational due to age related circumstances. Acquisition of the  three new instruments will bring to four the number of ultracentrifuges  on campus although use of the fourth machine will be limited due to its  age. The instruments will be used by the laboratories of seven major  and four minor users. They will also be used by two new faculty to be  hired in the areas of cell biology and molecular biology.         The instruments are required for standard methods in molecular  biology and biochemistry including a number of different subcellular  fractionation methods for membrane preparations, and to separate  protein or protein/RNA complexes.  Ultracentrifugation is also required  for certain DNA preparations where purity and yield are important.  These methods will be applied to several different projects.  These  include studies of: Mechanisms of protein localization in E. coli;  Identification of novel antigens for Lyme disease diagnosis; Topology  of a membrane associated regulator of prokaryotic DNA replication;  Dissection of Drosophila Paired protein function; Formation of the  mammalian visual cortex; Analysis of the cell division cycle in yeast;  Regulation of the 2(1) collagen gene in chick embryonic cartilage  cells; and the role of ferritin in defense against oxygen radical  toxicity.         Matching funds from Wesleyan University will pay for 50% of the  cost of the instruments.",
