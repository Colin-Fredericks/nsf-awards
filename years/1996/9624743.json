 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624743    Freckman  Nematodes, microscopic roundworms, are among the most complex  animals capable of survival in the soils of the Antarctic Dry  Valleys.  If dispersal of nematodes to habitats is uniform and  unlimited by geographical constraints, communities of nematodes  could potentially establish in all soils of the Dry Valleys of  Antarctica, as they do in other ecosystems studied.  Nematode  distribution in the Dry Valleys is patchy.  It follows that  dispersal rates are low, or the establishment of nematode  communities is governed by the suitability of potential habitats  and the ability of nematodes to survive harsh environmental  conditions.  Habitat suitability may be defined by such factors  as carbon availability or salinity.  This research project is  organized around central hypotheses that move from individual to  ecosystem scales in order to understand how nematodes disperse,  survive, and develop functional communities in Antarctic Dry  Valley soils.  The hypotheses are: (1) nematode community  function is more influenced by desiccation than temperature, and  (2) habitat suitability, not dispersal, is the major factor  determining establishment and maintenance of nematode communities  in the Dry Valleys. To test these hypotheses, field work will be  conducted to examine the characteristics of habitats that appear  suitable for nematode community growth and establishment by  sampling from a variety of sites, encompassing a wide range of  salinities, moistures, and carbon contents.  Stable isotope  studies (C and N) will provide information on sources of C  entering soil ecosystems and supporting nematodes. Dispersal will  be examined with traps in the field, and molecular techniques in  the laboratory to investigate the genetic variability that exists  between widely distributed nematodes with similar morphological  characteristics. The survival strategies of nematodes will be  examined under field and laboratory conditions to better  understand how these animals are able to p ersist under harsh  climatic conditions.  In addition, the soil food web serves as a  sensitive indicator of environmental change, particularly in this  ecosystem, where biodiversity is low and resource allocation is  primarily invested in survival.  Any knowledge about the degree  of influence of such change, as well as the influence of various  physical and chemical soil characteristics, can ultimately  extrapolated to other environments.",
