 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ermentrout  9626728       The investigator continues his work on the applications of  nonlinear dynamics to cell biology and physiology.  He studies  the effects of dendritic, axonal, and synaptic delays on the  behavior of coupled neural oscillators.  He develops and analyzes  models of neural oscillators in the presence of noise.  He  proposes and analyzes a variety of models for synaptic wave  propagation in neural tissue including:       1.  Systematic numerical exploration of models for spindle  waves in the nucleus reticularis.  Software developed in the  previous grant is capable of interactively solving these  integrodifferential equations.       2.  Analysis of synaptically induced bistability; how do  synaptic time constants and synaptic strengths effect the ability  of a group of synapses to maintain two modes of behavior: resting  and oscillatory       3.  Formal reduction of synaptically coupled biophysical  models to simplified models that are tractable to mathematical  analysis.  Both synaptic and intrinsic slow currents are  incorporated in these models.       4.  Rigorous and formal mathematical analysis of the above  reduced models with particular attention to maintaining  quantitative similarity to the full equations.       He extends his model of vasomotion in collaboration with Dr.  Jose Gonzalez-Fernandez to incorporate spatial aspects and  coupling via the tissue bed.  The goal is an explanation for the  classic results of Krogh on recruitment of capillaries and to  understand the dynamic regulation of blood flow at the  microvascular level.  He and Gonzalez-Fernandez intend to compare  the results with some recent data of Segal's as well as older  studies.  As a side benefit, they hope to develop some new methods  for analyzing systems of oscillators coupled though spatially  continuous, but nonoscillatory media.  He continues his  collaboration with George Oster, using prior results on linear  molecular motors and rotary motors to develop and analyze models  of (i) the p ortal protein of bacteriophages, (ii) proton-driven  motors, (iii) proton pumps.  He collaborates with Leah  Edelstein-Keshet on models for distribution of the lengths of  actin filaments and their spatial variation within the cell.       This work attempts to apply mathematical methods to aid in  the understanding of physiological rhythms.  Many human  biological processes are governed by waxing and waning of  different quantities.  Some examples are the voltage of the heart  pacemaker, the regular drifting in and out of different brain  states during sleep and the control of oxygen flow in muscles by  rhythmic contractions of small arteries during periods of  exercise.  The approach of this work is to use computer and  mathematical models.  Computing tools and tools for the  visualization of simulations are developed as part of this work.  The main goal is to use the models to bridge the gap between  details about the microscopic workings of cells and their  consequences for behavior.   For example, when muscles work hard,  they consume oxygen and thus need more oxygen from the arteries.  Within the cells that form the arteries are special gates that  sense the amount of \"fuel\" so that as this fuel decreases, the  gates tell the artery to open up.  This feedback loop provides a  way to dynamically alter the rhythm of the artery in order to  insure that the tissue is evenly oxygenated.  Thus, by starting  at the microscopic level of these gates or channels, a model is  built that can explain how the consumption of oxygen is regulated  in tissues.  Another example occurs in the nervous system.  Information from different parts of the brain is transmitted  through special connections between nerve cells called synapses.  Reaction times and cognitive abilities depend on the speed of  this propagation as well as the prevention of propagation into  other regions of the brain.  Much is known about the reactions of  individual nerve cells to stimuli.  Models provide a way of  coupling many such cells  together in order to understand the  behavioral consequences of the individual cell properties.  Is  the whole greater than the sum of the parts?  The goal of this  proposal is to try to answer this question for a variety of  rhythmically controlled physiological processes.",
