Nicoletti, Denise    \"Engineering Summer Camp for Middle School Girls\"    The goal of the proposed effort is to create a residential summer  camp for seventh grade girls that will generate interest and  excitement about engineering and technology and the ways it can be  used to help individuals, organizations, and society.  This camp  will address a need for an intervention program in Central  Massachusetts that will reach girls at an early enough age such  that they develop self-esteem and self-confidence in the areas of  math and science and realize the importance of taking four full  years of mathematics in high school.  The central and unique  feature of the camp experience will be a community service design  project in which teams of students solve a problem for a \"customer\"  in the Worcester community using teamwork and an engineering design  process.  Other program activities will include hands-on  experiential workshops and field trips.  The administrative  structure of the camp will be designed to expose girls to a broad  spectrum of female role models along the \"pipeline,\" from female  high school students to engineering faculty and practicing  engineers.    Several strategies will be used to ensure long-term effects of the  camp experience, as well as to magnify the camp's sphere of  influence.  Follow-up activities will be planned during the school  year, and wherever possible, participants will be funneled into  math and science intervention programs for high school students.   Outreach to parents will be an important aspect of the intervention  program, and middle school math and science teachers will be part  of the camp's administrative staff, learning about engineering and  career opportunities along with the girls.  A unique and  potentially powerful aspect of this project is that summative  evaluation of the camp will be conducted using a control group of  girls with similar backgrounds who did not experience the  intervention program.  T hus, the effect of the intervention program  on girls' interest in technology and their progress and educational  planning for the remainder of middle school and high school will be  measured relative to the effects of other variables.  ***",
