 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623543  Kriegsmann    It is proposed to model and analyze a class of physical problems arising in   microwave processing of ceramics.  These problems give rise to challenging   nonlinear initial boundary value problems, the mathematical statements of   which involve one or more nonlinear parabolic equations, governing  the   diffusion of heat and the diffusion of a chemical concentration, and the time   harmonic version of Maxwell's equations.  These equations are coupled   together in a nonlinear fashion and, in addition, nonlinear heat balances are   required in certain applications where surface temperatures produce  significant thermal radiation.  It is proposed to develop and use asymptotic   methods, dictated by certain physical limits, to simplify the mathematical   systems and to develop and use numerical methods to solve the reduced   problems.    The goals of the project are twofold.  The first is the mathematical   understanding of the basic physical mechanisms which make the processes   work.  Such an understanding would give scientists and engineers involved   in microwave processing of ceramics the basic scientific underpinnings to   judge and interpret their experimental findings. The second is the   development and application of asymptotic, numerical, and other    approximate methods required to obtain an accurate description of more   realistic and complicated processes. The successful completion of the   proposed research would allow engineers and scientists to design more   efficient sintering and joining processes for ceramics which would produce   higher quality materials.  It would also help in the design and   implementation of microwave assisted vapor deposition processes which are   highly promising in the construction of composite ceramic materials.",
