 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is using undergraduate independent study and research projects to train students to use mathematics as a tool for exploration and to view mathematics as an experimental science.  The pedagogical idea is to use student research projects which require computer skills, written reports, and other skills from mathematics as well as social sciences and physical sciences to integrate exploration into the undergraduate mathematics curriculum. The institution plan for both the BA and BS programs in mathematics requires that mathematics majors complete a project for graduation. To strengthen the central interdisciplinary role of mathematics in both the social and physical sciences, the lab is open to non-mathematics students with math intensive projects. The program seeks to support recruitment, retention and graduation of minority students through projects and one-on-one interaction between student and mentor.  The project also (a) provides a classroom/demo-room for math courses such as matrix analysis, differential equations, optimization, statistics and modeling; (b) expands the computer-based Calculus program; and (c) provides evening and Summer Workshops for in-service teachers as well as programs in mathematics education for pre-service teachers.",
