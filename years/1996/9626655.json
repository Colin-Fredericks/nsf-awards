 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tang 9626655   A novel concept, the pseudo-random recurrent artificial neural networks (ANN) will be used in control applications.  The Pseudo-random recurrent ANN is a novel concept derived from previous work on pseudo-random interconnection networks.  Instead of using a fully connected feedforward or recurrent network, a pseudo-random ANN is connected with a pseudo-random graph that can provide almost random connections of lots of neurons with a  small number of links at each neuron.  The idea is to use the large number of neurons to capture the non-linear nature of the control system; and yet the small number of links makes real-time implementation feasible.   The underlying pseudo-random graph, known as Cayley graphs have been the densest known graphs which means they have the largest number of nodes for a given degree and diameter.  By exploiting the node-symmetric property of these graphs,  simple simultaneous broadcasting their signals to all other neurons  can be developed.  The result is a \"brain-like\" ANN that have a large number  of neurons (hundreds and thousands) connected in an almost random manner with a relatively small number of connections.  These pseudo-random ANNs will be implemented with reinforcement control strategies such as the backpropagation of utility and the heuristic dynamic programming for some existing  non-linear control applications.  The investigation of ANNs that do not require complete connections of neurons will pave the way for a new form of ANN that has more resemblance to its biological counterpart.",
