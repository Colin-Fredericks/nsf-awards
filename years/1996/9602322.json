 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miami University, located in Oxford Ohio, is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of Hughes Hall,  home of the Department of Chemistry.  Constructed in 1970, the building's systems are inadequate to support research programs in analytical and organic chemistry and biochemistry.  Faculty are currently engaged in the following investigations:  utilizing mass spectrometry to explore the gas-phase chemistry of biomolecules;  Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) studies of peptide and protein ions; synthetic and physical organic chemistry, fatty acid biosynthetic pathways in plants; electrocatalysis, and microsporogenesis and nuclear-mitochondrial communication. The condition of the existing facility is now a detriment to the growth of the Department's research strength.   Laboratories limit the rate at which experimental work can be performed by researchers and, therefore, limit the productivity of faculty.  Research space does not comply with  modern safety standards, nor is it designed to accommodate more than two research students.  The project will consist of renovating twelve laboratories, representing four laboratories in each of the targeted fields, converting an exiting laboratory into a dedicated facility for the departmental FT-ICR, and modernizing an antiquated cold room.  New fume hoods and laboratory casework and benches, will be installed in addition to upgrading HVAC, electrical and plumbing utilities.  This project is critical to the continued development of the graduate program in Chemistry, and since 40% of women  are enrolled in the Program, the project will have a definite impact on the education of future women chemists.",
