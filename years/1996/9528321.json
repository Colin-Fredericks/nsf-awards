 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anthropologists have argued that the front-to-back flattening of the chest of humans and apes  (i.e. hominoids) increases the range of arm movement at the shoulder so that they can reach out  in all directions. This is supposedly essential for swinging from branch to branch hand-over hand,  like most living apes (and presumably, our ape-like ancestors). However, this arm-swinging  hypothesis of hominoid anatomy has recently been challenged by other hypotheses, which argue  that the special shape of the hominoid chest evolved for slow climbing (which also requires  reaching out in all directions) or for climbing on vertical tree trunks. Unfortunately, the function of  the flattened chest in hominoids, like the functions of many other shoulder anatomical features,  cannot be clarified because of a complete lack of data on shoulder mobility in primates. This  study will videographically measure the range of arm movement in 3 dimensions, on sedated  animals and on preparations of bones and ligaments, in order to compare the range of arm  movement in animals with chests of different shapes. This study will also measure chest shape  using x-rays of primate species with different locomotor behaviors, in order to examine the  relationship between locomotor behavior and chest shape. The results of the proposed research  will provide much-needed mobility data for evaluating numerous hypotheses in the study of the  functional and evolutionary anatomy of human and primate shoulders.",
