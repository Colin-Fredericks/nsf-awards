 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award, which supports U.S.-France cooperative research in molecular biology, involves Maria Tasayco of the City University of New York's City College and Michel Godlberg and Alain Chaffotte of the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France.  The objective of their research is to study the protein folding problem.  Specifically, they will investigate pathways by which fragments of E. Coli thioredoxin reconstitute the original structure of macromolecules.  Through the study of the function of thioredoxin, they propose to elucidate structure and the protein folding pathway.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in structural studies and approaches.  This is complemented by the French investigators' expertise in kinetic studies of protein folding.  The research will advance our understanding of the relationship between structure and function in biological macromolecules.",
