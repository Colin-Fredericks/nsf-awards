Venema is currently   investigating problems involving existence of topological embeddings   in codimension two.  For example, he is working on the problem of   determining which elements of the second homology group of a   simply-connected 4-dimensional manifold can be represented by   topologically embedded (possibly wild) 2-spheres.  This is a   special case of the following, more general, problem: If a  compact n-dimensional manifold-with-boundary has the homotopy type of  some closed (n-2)-manifold, then is there a (wild) topological  embedding of the second manifold into the first which is a homotopy  equivalence?  What if the manifolds are highly connected?       This project concerns Venema's efforts to understand knotted spheres  in 4-dimensional space.  Specifically, he is investigating the  question of what sorts of knots can be formed from different kinds of  spheres.  In the study of spheres in 4-dimensional spaces, three  different kinds of spheres have proved to be useful: those that are  smooth (possess continuously varying tangent vectors), those that are  piecewise linear (made up of a finite number of triangles), and those  that are topological (formed by continuous deformation).  Spheres of  the first two types are fairly well understood, and there is a  reasonably well developed theory which predicts when a continuous  function from a sphere into a space can be deformed to a one-to-one  function whose image is a smooth or piecewise linear sphere.  This  research project aims to understand the mysteries of topological  spheres.  ***",
