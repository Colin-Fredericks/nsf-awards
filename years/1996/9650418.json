 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graduates from both the Department of Manufacturing Technology and the Department of Mechanical Engineering often go into industrial positions in which they are directly involved with the usage of computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing equipment. Students in both of these departments are required to take courses that include use of CAD software.   The goal of this project is to enhance several CAD-related courses by providing the equipment necessary to produce physical prototypes. The previous content of these CAD courses has included instruction in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional modeling concepts. This project is expanding the capabilities of the CAD laboratories to include the capacity to produce actual physical prototypes of three-dimensional models described in a CAD system. This gives students quick feedback regarding the validity of their designs by allowing them to examine, hold, and in some cases, assemble and test models of complex three-dimensional objects. This equipment exposes students to new concepts and technologies that are becoming prevalent in industry today. Since the institution has not previously had a rapid prototyping system, this new equipment is also fostering greater cooperation among various departments and should generate opportunities for interdepartmental projects.",
