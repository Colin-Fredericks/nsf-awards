 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major part of this research is concerned with the further  development and use of the Diaz-Gimenez, Prescott, et al applied  general-equilibrium framework to evaluate monetary and fiscal  policy rules.  The thesis underlying this research program is  that the standard assumption that financial markets are costless  to operate is not a reasonable one when it comes to evaluating  monetary and fiscal stabilization policies.  In the framework  being developed, young households borrow to finance houses and  businesses.  The old, who have saved for their retirement, lend  to the intermediaries.  Borrowing and lending rates differ by a  large amount as in fact on average they do.  Preliminary results  are that the effects of public consumption shocks are much larger  in such worlds than in the standard real business cycle model.  Another dimension where the behavior of this model differs from  that of the standard real business cycle model with money  introduced via the cash-credit good constraint is that there can  be large and highly persistent deviations from the empirical  demand for money relationship.  The other part of the research  proposal is to determine whether corporate takeovers, or some  takeover like arrangement, are necessary for economic efficiency.",
