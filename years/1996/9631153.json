 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631153  Bustamante  This application describes a series of experiments designed  to investigate the response of DNA, proteins, and their  complexes when subjected to mechanical stress.  These  studies are a continuation of previous effects by this  laboratory to employ methods such as Optical Tweezers and  Scanning Force Microscopy (SFM) to investigate the  mechanical response of single molecules.  The proposed  studies are divided into three main groups:  i) Studies of  the elastic response of single dsDNA molecules; ii) Studies  of the elastic response of RecA-DNA filaments; and iii)  Studies of the mechanical denaturation of single molecules  of T4 lysozyme and titin.  %%%  The results of these studies will provide completely new  insights into the nature and magnitude of the intramolecular  forces that hold together biological structures.  In fact,  previously published work on the elasticity of single dsDNA  molecules has already resulted in the characterization of  three distinctive regimes of DNA elasticity.  These three  regimes are likely to play different roles in the process of  recombination in vivo.  The experiments proposed here will  extend these studies to directly investigate the mechanical  properties of the recombinant filaments and the denaturation  of single protein molecules.  ***",
