 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622411  Moore  This proposal supports the purchase of tissue and cellular  engineering equipment which will be dedicated to support research  in engineering at Florida International University.  The  equipment will be used for several research projects, including  in particular a study entitled \"Flow and Stretch Effects on  Vascular Endothelial Cells.\"  This project aims to quantitatively  identify how the mechanical environment in arteries affects the  formation of atherosclerosis.  The cells that line the inner  surfaces of arteries are subjected to both shear stress from the  flow of blood, and the circumferential stress that results from  the radial expansion of the artery during heart contraction.  Previous research has concentrated on either shear stress or  radial expansion, but not both.  In this research, cells will be  cultured onto the inner surfaces of tubes which behave  mechanically like arteries, then subjected to realistic  mechanical conditions including both shear stress and radial  expansion.  The secretion of substances thought to be important  in the formation of atherosclerosis will be measured using modern  biological techniques.  Other projects directed by the principal  investigator that will benefit from this equipment include flow  studies in the coronary arteries and flow analysis of vascular  stents.  Within the PI's department, there are at least five  other projects that will be able to make use of the proposed  equipment.  ***",
