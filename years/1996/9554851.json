 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project NATURE is a collaborative research experience involving undergraduate students in an introductory biology  course.  The focus of their research will be on problems and solutions related to the restoration of natural areas, in  particular, prairie restoration.  The project is unique in that it shares the knowledge and biological products (seeds and  plants) produced by undergraduate students with teachers and students in schools and private citizens interested in  preserving and restoring prairies.    About 900 students per year, for the next several years, will be conducting research on seed germination, seedling and  juvenile plant survivorship, and the mortality and survival of vegetative and flowering plants, as well as, the  relationship between plant weight and seed set.  This life history approach to the conservation of plant species is  currently viewed by ecologists as an important way to guide recovery efforts for rare and declining plant populations.    This 5-week collaborative research experience in an introductory biology course will show students that they too can  contribute to the restoration of natural areas, while learning what it means to add their own small piece to a body of  scientific knowledge.",
