 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513846  Anderson  This award provides renewed support for the algae collection at the Provasoli-Guillard Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton (PGC) at the Bigelow Laboratory.  The PGC formally established in 1980, and was designated a National Center and Facility by Act of Congress in 1992.  The collection maintained by the PGC is a unique resource for the study of marine algae, especially those found in the open ocean.  Approximately 1450 cultures consisting mainly of well-identified organisms in pure culture are propagated by serial transfer in liquid or on agar.  The PGC currently sends about 1000 cultures a year to public and private sector researchers in the U.S. and abroad.  There is a small charge for each culture.  Funds raised through sales amount to about 25% of the total budget and are used for collection activities, including purchase and maintenance of equipment, and purchase of materials and supplies.  The collection is managed by a part-time Director, with the assistance of a curator and assistant curator.  Oversight is provided by an external advisory committee which meets annually to advise the Director of the Collection and the CEO of the Bigelow Laboratory. The committee has a formal charter describing its duties and provisions for appointing new members as current members expire.  Funds provided through this award are largely devoted to staff salaries, purchase of equipment and part of the costs of the annual advisory committee meeting.  ***",
