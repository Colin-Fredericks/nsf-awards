 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9627989  University of District of Columbia    \"Behavior of Stratified Sand-Gravel Composites Under Seismic  Liquefaction Conditions\"    The proposed research is to provide an investigation of the  behavior of stratified sand-gravel composites under seismic  liquefaction conditions.  The behavior of stratified soils will be  evaluated for different gravel contents.  The effect of variation  of confining pressure on the liquefaction parameters of sand-gravel  composites will be investigated for two methods of sample  preparation, namely pluviation through air (representing uniform  soil conditions) and sedimentation (representing layered soil  conditions).  The stress-controlled automated cyclic triaxial tests  at the University of the District of Columbia will be used for the  purpose of evaluating liquefaction potential.    The primary objective of the proposed study is compare the behavior  of stratified and homogeneous sand-gravel composites under seismic  liquefaction conditions for various gravel contents and confining  pressures.  Such comparison will enhance our understanding of soil  behavior under seismic liquefaction conditions.  As a result, a  conceptual framework for analytical studies can be made.    The proposed project will only provide a fundamental advancement  for modelling these layered soils, but also improve the research  capability of the civil engineering program at the University of  the District of Columbia.  Student exposure to the experiments will  enhance the representation of minorities in engineering  disciplines.  ***",
