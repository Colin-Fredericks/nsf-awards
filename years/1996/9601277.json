 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be carried out in two subfields of theoretical  elementary particle physics.       One project will deal with string theory, the most promising  candidate for the unification of all the fundamental interactions  in nature.  Particular attention is paid to models that can be  exactly solved to extract physical insights and to apply them to  the real world.  The strategy is to search for exact relations  between apparently different models, which will be then used to  solve more difficult and realistic models.  This project will  also investigate the theoretical basis of novel phenomena in  materials physics, observed in interfaces at high magnetic field.  The phenomena of interest are associated with a class or quantum  statistic, extending ideas associated with researchers such as  Bose, Einstein, Fermi and Dirac.  Understanding the theoretical  basis for the rich variety of complex phenomena in the behavior  of materials strengthens our ability to develop new materials and  applications.       A second project will continue first principle studies of  quantum chromodynamics (the theory of the strong nuclear  interactions) through the use of high performance computer  simulations.  Emphasis is to be placed on testing and refining  improved methods of computation that promise to extend  dramatically the power of numerical simulation at a vastly  reduced computational cost.  The new methods will make it  possible, starting from experimental results, to extract the most  precise information to date about the fundamental interactions in  nature.  They will also be used to explore the high temperature  phase transition between quarks and gluons confined in nuclear  particles such as nucleons and the free quark-gluon plasma.  Such  a phase transition occurred in the evolution of the early  universe and is thought to be achievable in the laboratory in  collisions of heavy ions at the RHIC accelerator currently under  construction at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.  These  studies are important for extending our understanding of the most  fundamental basis of our physical world and of the origins of our  universe.  Ideas concerning new computational methods are likely  to have applications in other computational fields.",
