 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530379  Anderson         This research project is part of the US Joint Global  Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at  (1) a better understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both  organic and inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2)  identifying the physical, ecological and biogeochemical  factors and processes which regulate the magnitude and  variability of these fluxes, and (3) placing these fluxes  into the context of the contemporary global carbon cycle.       This work is one of forty-four projects that are  collaborating in the Southern Ocean Experiment, a three-  year effort south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone to  track the flow of carbon through its organic and inorganic  pathways from the air-ocean interface through the entire  water column into the bottom sediment.   The experiment  will make use of the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer and the R/V  Thompson.       This component is a study of how naturally radioactive  material in the ocean sediment may be used to reconstruct  the flux of biogenic material through the water column to  the sediment, and by inference, the productivity of the  surface layers.  There is evidence that the current surface  conditions of high nutrient levels, but low chlorophyll  levels do not extend back into colder climatic epochs, and  that an examination of radionuclides may allow the  reconstruction of rates of paleoproductivity.       Two aspects of the biogeochemical cycling and physical  transport of radionuclide tracers in the modern ocean will  be investigated.  In the first part, the concentration of a  series of natural radionuclide tracers (thorium-230,  protactinium-231, and Beryllium-10) in the Southern Ocean  will be measured for their scavenging behavior both in the  water column and in particulate material collected by  sediment traps. The goal is to test the proposed use of  radionuclide ratios as proxy variables for the export flux.  In the second part, the concentration values will be  introduced into an ocean general circulat ion model to  evaluate the transport of radionuclides by the ocean  circulation on scales that are larger than the spatial  gradients in particle flux.  These combined efforts will  better define our ability to use radionuclide ratios to  evaluate past changes in ocean productivity, and improve  our understanding of the response of ocean productivity to  climate variability.  ***",
