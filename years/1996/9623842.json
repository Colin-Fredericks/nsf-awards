Josephson tunneling provides  a  phase  sensitive   technique  to  examine  the  energy  gap   and   some  measurements  in  HTS  have suggested a  zero  energy  gap  along  particular  directions indicating a different, d-wave,  electron-  electron   pairing  mechanism  compared  to  s-wave  pairing   in  conventional superconductors.  This research will investigate the  transport properties across a HTS and conventional superconductor  interface.   Three  experiments are  planned:  to  determine  how  electrons  are reflected by the interface; to study how electrons  or  electron pairs behave after tunneling through the  interface;  and  to  investigate induced superconductivity in a normal  metal  film  in  close proximity to the HTS.  Student and post  doctoral  fellow  education  will  be supported and  will  provide  trained  professionals  in   the superconductor and related  semiconductor  industries.  %%%  High temperature superconductors (HTS) have important fundamental  properties   that   differ  from  conventional  low   temperature  superconductors.   Current  transport  that   is   uniform   with  direction  in conventional superconductors varies with  direction  in  crystalline HTS in response to a fundamental anisotropy.  The  goal  of  this  research is to investigate the  origin  of  these  anisotropic  properties.   In  particular,  this  research   will  improve  our  understanding of how conventional  low  temperature  superconductors and normal metals can be connected to the HTS and  how  current  will  be transported across that  interface.   Such  knowledge  is  important for the introduction and improvement  of  superconducting  devices  in the electronics,  telecommunication,  and  medical  diagnostic industries.  Professional edu cation  and  training  will  be  provided for students  and  a  post  doctoral  fellow.  ***",
