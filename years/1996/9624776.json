Particular attention is being drawn to the question of how transport in ultrasmall geometries can cause a system to behave in ways significantly different than its behavior in bulk.  In chemical engineering this focus has translated directly into investigations of the structure and dynamics of liquids at interfaces.  Even for the case of simple Newtonian liquids, novel transport behavior has been recently uncovered related to the interplay between surface tension, surface tension gradients, evaporation, and Van derWaals forces - forces which have been studied for over a century but whose coupling can lead to interesting and unexpected instabilities in very thin films.    The general objective of this research is to develop a complete and fundamental understanding of the spreading kinetics of one liquid on the surface of a supporting liquid higher surface tension with particular focus on issues of stability.  The first project involves the characterization of a hydrodynamic fingering instability which occurs during the advance of spreading surfactant solutions along a moist support. Given the implications of this simple laboratory marker to differentiate surfactant solutions providing stable homogeneous coverage from those yielding unstable, dendritic, and inhomogeneous coverage.  The second instability involves Marangoni stresses coupled to evaporative effects.  A novel fingering instability develops spanwise along the thickened receding edge of a volatile hydrocarbon liquid film receding from a bulk water support after spontaneous hole nucleation and growth.  Understanding how to prevent such an instability can lead to a new technique for hydrocarbon separation involving Marangoni stresses.    The four year experimental and theoretical program will characterize these instabilities wh ich can significantly affect transport behavior in system ranging from surfactant transport in pulmonary flow, to the fabrication of organic films used in optical microdevices, to the separation of hydrocarbon mixtures in the films.  These two types of instabilities and their characteristics pattern formations develop at the advancing or receding front of a thin liquid film coating the surface of a liquid support.  The challenge is to fully characterize the flows from a liquid mechanical point of view and more importantly to use this knowledge to develop practical schemes with which to enhance transport properties and reduce inhomogeneous surface coverage in thin spreading films.  Suggestions for such schemes are described.  ***",
