 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student  visualization  of  spatial  and  temporal  relationships  traditionally  has  presented a challenge  unique  to  geoscience  faculty.  In California, however, the existing teaching  problems  are  being  exacerbated as a growing population of  students  for  whom  English  is the second language is being incorporated  into  university  communities.  This  inexorably  growing  concern   of  communication  of  scientific  concepts  and  principles  to   an  audience  with  lower  levels  of  English  facility  requires  a  fundamental  modification  of  our teaching  philosophy  and  the  methods   of  delivery  of  the  information  in  the  classroom.  Additionally,   because  of  societal  influences,   contemporary  students are oriented toward visual learning rather than auditory  learning.   Although no single solution to our  academic  dilemma  exists,    one    potentially   fruitful   direction,    offering  substantially  increased  efficacy in educational  communication,  lies  in  the  subordination  of the  spoken  word  to  alternate  communication   methods.   Short,  computer-animated   simulation  sequences carefully linked to oral lecture material, can be used.        In  this  scenario  animations will  be  presented  in  the  classroom  using  existing television  monitors  and  video  tape  players.  To implement instructional simulations and thus improve  student  comprehension of geologic relationships,  this  proposal  seeks  support for the purchase of computer equipment  to  create  and     record     animated     sequences     appropriate     for  classroom/laboratory  instruction.   To  maximize  use   of   the  modules,  descriptions and single frame examples of  all  modules  will  be  placed  as  web pages on our existing  web  server  for  browsing. Copies of animations can then be obtained by contacting  the  writer.  If interest is sufficient, the files will  be  made  available on the web server for direct downloading.",
