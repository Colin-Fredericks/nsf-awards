Each feature will take one of three forms:  News Features based on current research, answers to Audience Questions about science, or Skits and Songs that convey basic science concepts.  The AAAS also will begin securing carriage for the pilot programs and a potential longer series of programs.    The PI will be Robert Hirshon who is currently the Project Director and Executive Producer for Kinetic City Super Crew.  Justin Warner, who has been producer/writer for the AAAS radio features Science Update and Why Is It?, will be the Producer/Head Writer.
