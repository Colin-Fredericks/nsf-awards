 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David B. Rozema has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research   Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Rozema received the doctoral degree from   the University of Wisconsin at Madison under the supervision of Professor   Samuel H. Gellman.  Dr. Rozema will continue research at the University   of Utah under the sponsorship of Professor Dale Poulter.  The   postdoctoral research investigates of  the mechanism of the enzyme,   protein farnesyl transferase, a member of the general family of protein   isoprenyl transferases that catalyze the posttranslation modification of   many membrane-bound proteins.  The research focuses on the role of zinc   in substrate binding, the nature of the interaction between zinc and   peptide substrate, and the participation of zinc in the transition state   of the reaction.  The enzyme is a target for anticancer therapies.  The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as   an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge   and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in   contemporary chemical research and teaching.",
