 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    PI:  Gowaty  PROPOSAL NUMBERS  9631801        The hypothesis that the research is designed to test is that  female choice of mates for traits that affect the  viabilities of females  offspring affects females   preferences for particular mates even in social systems in  which females seem unable to chose or in which females   options are ecologically or socially modified.  Social  behavior that can interfere with a female s ability to  achieve mating \\s with her preferred partners include male-  male- interactions female-female s interactions, and  interactions between the female and those males that attempt  to manipulate or modify her choice via forced copulation,  aggressive conditioning, affiliative conditioning, or  brokering of food resources in exchange for matings.  The  research is specifically designed to test the generality of  this hypothesis and will include comparisons of outcomes  from nearly identical experimental protocols on six well-  known and frequently studied species representing  phylongenetically diverse taxa.  This research is  collaborative and cooperative.  It will include experiments  on laboratory populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura,  Drosophilia hydei at the university of Georgia, guppies,  Poecilea reticulata, at Trondheim University Cockroaches,  Nauphoeta cinerea, at the University of Kentucky, mallards,  Anas platyrhynchos at the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands  Research Station, and wild house mice, Mus musculus, at the  University of Southern Illinois at Carbondale.  The research  protocol involves exposing females to sets of males, which  researchers will pick at random with respect to phenotypic  variation of individuals from populations consisting of  virgin males from diverse sources.  Test females will  demonstrate preferences in choice arenas.  After  Establishing her preferred mate, half of the test females  will be placed in breeding chambers with preferred males and  half with non preferred.  The viability (surv ival to  adulthood or independence) of offspring from several types  of control manipulations including those from an identical  series of male choice trials.  The significance of this  research lies in the rarity of studies of the effects of  freely expressed mate choice by females or males on  offspring viability or quality.  It will be the first to  evaluate 1) the theoretical assumption that the effects of  female choice outweigh the effects of male choice for  species with typical post-fertilization investments in  offspring:  2. the prediction that for a species (D. hydei)  with relatively equal post-fertilization investments that  male and female choice are equally important to offspring  viability; 3. how viabilities of offspring vary under freely-  expressed mate choice (By females and males) compared to non  preferred matings; and 4. differences in offspring viability  as a function of whether matings are managed or represent  choices made by freely-acting individuals.",
