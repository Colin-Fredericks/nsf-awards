Fundamental studies of  the equations of state, optical properties, fragilities, and both  fast  and  slow  relaxation processes of  viscous  liquid  glass-  forming   systems;  and  the  optical,  mechanical,  and  dynamic  properties  of glassy, crystalline, and polymeric materials  will  be  conducted using both high-pressure and powerful  optical  and  light scattering techniques.  Students in this program will  have  an  opportunity to conduct high-pressure viscosity experiments by  visiting  the Exxon Research and Engineering Laboratory under  an  existing  collaboration.  Integrally  related  to  this  research  program  will  be  the  development  of  a  unique  upper   level  undergraduate  laboratory for the Growth and Characterization  of  Optical Materials (which is being developed in part under NSF-ILI  award number: DUE 9452409).  %%%  This program will have two integrally related components: (i) the  development  of an academic research program aimed  at  exploring  fundamental properties of liquids and solids under extremely high  pressure,  and  (ii)  the development of  a  unique  upper  level  undergraduate  laboratory for the Growth and Characterization  of  Optical  Materials. A common theme to both components is the  use  of  modern  laser  and  optical techniques. The  first  component  focuses  on  fundamental studies of viscous  liquids  and  melted  polymers  and the ways in which they solidify at low  temperature  or  high  pressure  into either a crystalline  material  with  an  ordered  arrangement of molecules or a glassy material where  the  arrangement   is   random.  The  s econd   component   will   give  undergraduate   science  and  engineering   students   \"hands-on\"  experiences,  using  modern equipment, with  several  aspects  of  materials  research.  This  laboratory  course  will   focus   on  important  semiconducting  and optical materials  as  educational  vehicles   for   developing  skills  in  growing  materials   and  determining  their physical, electrical, and optical  properties.  Undergraduates will be involved in both components  and  graduate  students   will   have  opportunities  to  conduct  high-pressure  viscosity  measurements  at the Exxon  Research  and  Engineering  Laboratory under an existing collaboration.  ***",
