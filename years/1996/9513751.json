 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513751  Murray  Nontranslated mRNAs are packaged by protein particles into messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) in male and female germ cells. Both the storage of these mRNAs and their correct temporal mobilization to polyribosomes are required for germ cell differentiation and the earliest stages of embryogenesis. This research will study the evolutionarily conserved protein components of translationally regulated mRNPs. Translational regulation of maternal and paternal mRNPs is likely to involve both general mRNP proteins and, in some cases, sequence-specific mRNA-binding proteins dedicated to specific mRNAs. The goal of this research project is to characterize the general mRNP component and the mechanism by which it regulates translation of maternal mRNAs in Xenopus laevis.  This research will identify Xenopus oocyte protein particles that inhibit in vitro translation of particle-bound mRNA. The translational regulatory particle (TRP) will be purified, and its composition and activities characterized. Its mechanism of translational inhibition will be determined by analyzing TRP-mRNA interactions, and how this effects translational initiation. We will also evaluate possible involvement of TRP in the translational mobilization process. This analysis of Xenopus oocyte TRP will lead to an understanding of an evolutionarily conserved process that is essential for germ cell differentiation, fertility and early embryogenesis of many species, including human.  %%%  Nontranslated mRNAs are inactive templates for protein synthesis that are packaged by protein particles into messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) in male and female germ cells, the precursors to sperm and egg. Both the storage of these mRNAs and their correct temporal mobilization to polyribosomes when they become active templates for protein synthesis are required for development of the fertilized egg. The frog Xenopus laevis is best suited for this analysis because of its reproductive strategy of releasing thousands of  eggs, and the high degree of evolutionary conservation of some previously studied mRNP proteins to the mammalian proteins.  Xenopus oocyte (egg) protein particles that inhibit in vitro translation of particle-bound mRNA will be identified, the translational regulatory particle (TRP) purified, and its composition and activities characterized. Its mechanism of inhibition of protein synthesis will be determined by analyzing TRP-mRNA interactions, and how this effects translational initiation. We will also evaluate possible involvement of TRP in the translational mobilization process. This analysis of Xenopus oocyte TRP will lead to an understanding of an evolutionarily conserved process that is essential for germ cell differentiation, fertility and early embryo development of many species, including human.  ***",
