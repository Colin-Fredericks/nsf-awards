Ion channels  are large proteins that allow current in the form of ions to pass  across cell membranes.  These channels are the fundamental units  of current conduction in the neuromuscular system and the  interrelationships of a large variety of ion channels shape the  electrical signals of the system.  The study of ion channels is  useful not only for the purpose of deeper basic understanding of  the neuromuscular system, but also because ion channel function  is implicated in various neuromuscular diseases and because  pharmaceutical products, such as anesthetics, are targeted at ion  channels.  An experimental technique known as the \"single channel  patch clamp\" allows recordings to be made which provide important  information about these channels.  The apparently random  character of the recorded currents has led to the widespread use  of statistical models for the dynamics of the channels and to the  use of statistical techniques of data processing.  The very large  quantity of data produced by such recordings poses substantial  computational problems which must be resolved in order that  important information about the channels can be extracted  efficiently.  This interdisciplinary proposal is primarily  concerned with the development of effective statistical and  computational  methodology.",
