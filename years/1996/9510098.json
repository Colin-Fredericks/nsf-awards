 "awd_abstract_narration": "9510098  Kristovich        Mesoscale flows within convective boundary layers must be understood in  order to fully determine the link between synoptic-scale circulations and surface  characteristics. Observational evidence suggests that theoretical criteria are often  unsuccessful in predicting the predominant mesoscale convective organization in the  boundary layer.  In particular, boundary layer flow structure knows as  rolls  are  often observed when cellular convection is predicted.          The proposed study seeks to employ both numerical and observational  techniques to: (1) determine factors which control the development of boundary  layer rolls in lake-effect snowstorms; and (2) determine how the mesoscale  organization of convection influences mass overturning rates, precipitation rates, and  boundary layer depth.  The first goal will be accomplished by careful documentation  of the three-dimensional structure of mesoscale convection near the eastern shore of  Lake Michigan and how it varies with upwind atmospheric conditions and evolution  of boundary layer winds, temperature, and moisture (ice, liquid, and vapor) profiles  across the lake.  Numerical simulations will be carried out over the range of  observed conditions to give a more complete data set for determining the influence  of wind shear, latent heat release, and other factors, on the organization of boundary  layer convection.  The influence of mesoscale convective organizations on mass  overturning rates, precipitation rates, and boundary layer depth will be accomplished  by carefully documenting how these features change near the downwind shore in  both observations and simulations of rapidly changing mesoscale convective  structure.    This work is based on observations taken during the University of Chicago Lake  Snow Project.  Numerical aspects of this work will be carried out with the Advanced  Regional Prediction System model developed at the Center for Analysis and  Prediction of Storms at the University of Oklahoma .  This research will be a  collaborative effort between the Illinois State Water Survey and the South Dakota  School of Mines and Technology.  ***",
