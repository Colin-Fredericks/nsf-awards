 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to participate in a cruise of RV Jan Mayen (University of  Troms() which was planned as a joint USA/Norwegian research cruise between investigators at the University of Colorado and the University of Troms(, Norway.  The Co-Chief Scientists on the cruise will be Hald (Troms() and Jennings (Colorado).  The research plan was developed jointly during a sabbatical of Hald in Colorado and built upon the reconnaissance marine cruises that had been undertaken with INSTAAR leadership in 1991 and 1993.    The cruise will take place between Sept. 21 and Oct. 10th, 1996 (Troms( to Troms() and will undertake a transect from NW Iceland, across Denmark Strait to the East Greenland margin at ca. 68o N (Fig. 1).  The major goal of the cruise is to extract sediment cores which will provide information on the extent of the Greenland Ice Sheet in the Denmark Strait, and the late Quaternary paleoceanography and on ice sheet/ocean interactions across this critical \"gateway\" between the arctic and mid-latitude North Atlantic.  Based on existing core data (mainly 1-2 m long gravity cores), and on a detailed analysis of 1655 km of seismic tracklines on the E. Greenland shelf,  key coring sites have been selected to 1) test potential late Quaternary ice-sheet grounding positions on the shelf: and 2) extend our paleoceanographic time-frame on the shelf well beyond the 8 to 14 ka basal age limit that we encountered previously.  The ability to obtain 10-m cores will potentially allow the team to obtain records into Marine Isotope Stage 2/3, depending on the glacial history.  The Jan Mayen will be equipped with a piston corer that will allow the scientists to obtain 10 m long cores, which will revolutionize their ability to extract the information needed to obtain on glacial ice extent and icesheet ocean interactions.  Preliminary analyses of the East Greenland cores will also be undertaken including visual and x-radiograph core descriptions, laser color logging, bulk density measurements, volume and m ass magnetic susceptibility, AMS 14C dating of foraminifera and potentially molluscs, and coarse resolution foraminiferal biostratigraphy.",
