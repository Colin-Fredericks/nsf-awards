In particular, discrete  \"phase-slip\"  events  have  been identified which are thought to represent  the  creation  and  evolution  of  single  quantum  vortices  in   the  superfluid.  The present work is intended to supply some  of  the  additional information needed to test models of the creation  and  evolution processes. Further, it will study the transition  to  a  different  type of critical velocity behavior that is customarily  observed  in  apertures  and tubes appreciably  larger  than  one  micron in diameter.  %%%  This  work  is  directed at understanding  the  fundamental  flow  properties  of  superfluid  liquid  helium.  The  study  requires  temperatures  near  absolute zero, where physical  systems  often  show  simpler and sometimes unusual properties. In  the  case  of  liquid  helium,  its  purity  and molecular  simplicity  and  the  appearance of a remarkable degree of order in its flow have  made  it  a  superb  system  for testing fundamental  ideas  about  the  properties  and  behavior of fluids. The present studies  concern  the first appearance of disorder in the flow and the accompanying  dissipation  of  energy  as the velocity  is  increased  above  a  certain  level, phenomena analogous to the onset of instabilities  and  turbulence in the flow of ordinary fluids. An integral  part  of this work is the training of graduate students in physics in a  broad range of experimental and research skills.  ***",
