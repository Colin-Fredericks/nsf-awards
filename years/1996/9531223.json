 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531223  Pinski  This theoretical renewal grant focuses on first-principles  calculations of atomic correlations in metallic alloys.  For  iron-nickel alloys, existing theories and computer codes  will be used to calculate several properties of these alloys  including the total energy as a function of volume and  magnetic arrangement, and atomic short-range order.  While  currrent theories should be sufficient in the nickel-rich  region of the phase diagram, the effect of atomic  displacements needs to be included for the iron-rich end.  For iron-nickel alloys with about thirty-seven percent  nickel (INVAR), many properties have anomalous behavior as a  function of temperature, pressure or magnetic field.  This  behavior has been linked to strong magneto-volume coupling.  Current computational codes will be extended to include  these effects.     The utility of the calculated direct-correlation function  can be increased by its use in a theory of first-order phase  transitions.  The current approach looks at the instability  of the random alloy to a concentration wave with an  infinitesimal amplitude and therefore only gives indication  of possible second-order transitions.  Since most alloy  transitions are first-order, density functional theory will  be used to calculate the coexistence region.  %%%  A computationally-intensive program will investigate the  effects of atomic correlations on the properties of metallic  alloys - in particular, iron-nickel alloys.  These state-of-  the-art calculations will yield new insight to understanding  the behavior of this important class of materials.  In  addition, fundamental insight will be gained into the phase  behavior of alloys in general.  ***",
