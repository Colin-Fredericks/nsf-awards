 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the creation of a Mathematica calculus laboratory to allow for the introduction of a reformed, laboratory-based, calculus course using the Duke/Bowdoin Project CALC materials. The 3-semester calculus sequence is the project's major source of contact with science majors. Mathematica is perhaps the most powerful piece of software currently available for use by mathematicians and scientists. The project's effort to present a laboratory-based calculus course enables the mathematics department and the science departments to build on the students' knowledge of Mathematica to enhance instruction in advanced courses. The project's immediate goals are construction of an optimum hardware/software teaching environment for a Mathematica calculus laboratory where students can use the calculus materials developed at Duke University, Bowdoin College, and Rockhurst College; dissemination of information regarding issues of teaching and group-learning mathematics in a laboratory environment to colleagues at both the collegiate and precollegiate level; forging of new relationships with five high schools in the area by offering calculus workshops based on laboratory experiences to faculty and students from those institutions; and comparison of the results of a 3-year project using Hewlett-Packard 48G graphing calculators in calculus with those using a Mathematica computer laboratory.",
