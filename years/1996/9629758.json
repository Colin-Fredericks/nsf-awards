Due to their isolation, these people were long able to maintain their traditional lifestyle. The focus of the study is Nash Harbor, a known late historic village with at least 350 years of occupation. By integrating the oral testimony of island elders with the results of archaeological excavations and known ethnographic accounts, a comprehensive view of the lifeways of this unique culture will be revealed. This project will provide an enhanced understanding of the intimate relationship between the Cupiit people and their environment before the contact period, as well as an assessment of the impacts of Euroamerican culture into the late 20th century. The program involves local people in research, and contributes to an increased scientific and cultural literacy at the community level.    ??",
