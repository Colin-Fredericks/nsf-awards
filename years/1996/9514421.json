 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514421  Thompson    Understanding the functioning of messenger molecules inside  cells is critical for a complete explanation of how nerve  cells communicate.  Activation of molecular receptors on the  surface of nerve cells by neurotransmitter molecules  unleashes a cascade of events, which is orchestrated by the  intracellular messengers.  The key messenger is the  concentration of calcium ions, which controls the production  of the gaseous neurotransmitter, nitric oxide (NO).  Nitric  oxide, in turn, stimulates the production of the cyclic  nucleotide messenger, cGMP.  Calcium ions, NO, and cGMP  together regulate numerous physiological events, including  synaptic transmission and the opening of membrane ion  channels.   The focus of this research project is on the  dynamics of calcium ion concentrations, which are affected  by calcium release from intracellular storage compartments  and by calcium ion inflow through the cell membrane. More  specifically, the experiments are concerned with the  internal signaling pathway that is activated by muscarinic  cholinergic receptors in cultured cells.  Techniques  employed include the voltage clamp and calcium imaging;  these are combined with modern molecular techniques to  examine in detail rate-limiting steps in the activation of  calcium release, for calcium influx, and in the production  of cGMP.    It is expected that these experiments will greatly advance  our understanding of fundamental cellular mechanisms that  regulate signaling within nerve cells.",
