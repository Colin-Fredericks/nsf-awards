It is organized by the American  Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) under the auspices of the  United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster  Reduction (IDNDR), and supported by a number of United  States Federal agencies.  The purpose of the NDR'96 is to  promote and assess the role of civil engineering, through  its interaction with other disciplines, in mitigating,  preparing for a recovering from natural disaster impacts on  the built and natural environments.  Sessions have been  organized where the causes, effects and mitigation of  hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, landslides and  other natural hazards hazards will be discussed and where  advances in knowledge related to these types of disasters  will be presented.  Proceedings from NDR'96 will be given  worldwide dissemination which will provide the natural  hazards international community with an up-to-date source of  information on and a research agenda for natural disaster  reduction.  ***",
