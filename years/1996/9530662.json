The  Principal Investigator will investigate two types of terrain-induced atmospheric phenomena  through a series of numerical simulations. One focus of this effort will be to investigate the  three-dimensional response of the cross-mountain flow to mountain wave generation and  breakdown. The second focus will be to determine the relative importance of gap winds and  downslope winds in the generation of strong orographically-forced surface winds.        Atmospheric scientists have long been aware that orographically generated gravity  waves may exert an important drag on the atmosphere. Early discussions of this phenomena  date back to the late 1950's. Continued interest in gravity wave drag (GWD) has been fueled  by experiments with high-resolution general circulation models, which suggest that the  inclusion of GWD parameterizations in such models can significantly improve the simulated  climatology of the zonally averaged westerly winds and the surface pressure fields. GWD  parameterizations are now standard features in most high-resolution general circulation and  medium-range weather forecast models, yet the nature of the mesoscale atmospheric  response to GWD forcing remains largely unexplored. Recent results obtained by the  Principal Investigator under prior NSF support suggest that the mean-flow deceleration that  develops in response to gravity wave drag is spread over a surprising large spatial domain  upstream and downstream from the mountain. These results also suggested that a different  diagnostic variable, the pseudomomentum, could provide a better description of the local  response to gravity wave drag. The Principal Investigator's previous results were obtained  using a high-resolution two-dimensional numerical model.  These investigations will be  extended to three dimensions using a newly developed 3D nested-grid model. As part of the  proposed research, the Principal Investigator  will also derive expressions for the  pseudomomentum in 3D compressible stratified flow using Hamiltonian fluid dynamics.        Strong surface winds can be generated by the interaction of the synoptic-scale flow  and topography through two different mechanisms: gap winds and downslope winds. Gap  winds are produced when air is forced through a narrow break in a mountain barrier.  Examples of this occur in the Columbia River gorge and in the mistral, which blows through  the Rhone valley of France. Strong downslope winds may be generated when the air flows  across mountains without significant cross-mountain gaps; examples include the Rocky  Mountain Chinook and the Croatian Bora. In still other cases, such as the strong easterly  winds that blow from the Cascades toward the town of Enumclaw, Washington, the  distinction between gap winds and downslope winds is not so clear. Previous research with a  shallow-water model has suggested that the gap wind mechanism is more effective on large  spatial scales (very broad mountain ranges pierced by a gap) whereas the downslope wind  mechanism is most effective on small spatial scales (narrow ridges). These early results will  be extended to three dimensions and to a variety of more realistic atmospheric  configurations, using the new 3D nested grid model. As before, the goal will be to  characterize the large-scale forcing with a minimal number of dynamical and terrain-shape  parameters and to systematically investigate the sensitivity of gap winds and downslope  winds to variations in these parameters. Possible synergetic combinations of the two wind  regimes will also be investigated.  ***",
