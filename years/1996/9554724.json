 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Teaching Teachers to Teach Engineering\" is a one-week workshop offered during the summer at the United States Military Academy.  The workshop is offered to faculty of all engineering disciplines who want to be good Teachers. The workshop strives to address the needs of faculty from two-year and four-year institutions, teaching and research   institutions, who are seeking high teaching standards, and efficiencies in preparation.  The workshop addresses topics in preparation, presentation, self-critique, learning models, goals and objectives, advanced technology, student-teacher relations, testing/grading, advising, legal aspects of teaching, research, scholarship, and time management.  Participants are expected to prepare and present classes, critique others, apply   workshop material in mini-class environments, and prepare an action plan for their next term.  Workshop participants will work in various size teams to develop confidence and poise in the classroom.  Participants will leave the workshop with the tools necessary to present logical and thought provoking presentations to their student.  They are expected to interact with faculty at their home institution to improve the teaching of others through seminars and presentations.  This workshop will guide faculty toward an efficient way to be both a good teacher and a successful researcher.",
