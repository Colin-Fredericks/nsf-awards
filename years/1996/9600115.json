 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600115  Dale    The Alabama Alliance for Minority Participation Program Phase I  began in 1991, as a response to a national need to increase the  number of underrepresented minorities receiving undergraduate  degrees in science, engineering and mathematics (SEM).  Initial  Alliance Members included eight Historically Black Colleges and  Universities:  Alabama A&M University, Alabama State University,  Miles College, Oakwood College, Stillman College, Talladega  College, Tougaloo College, Tuskegee University, one majority  institution, University of Alabama at Birmingham; and two  businesses.  The Coca-Cola Foundation and International Business  Machines (IBM).  Conceived and initiated by ten black faculty at  these institutions with Ph.D. degrees in science and mathematics,   Alliance programs were designed to attract minorities to careers in  SEM disciplines, increase retention rates, and increase the quality  and quantity of underrepresented minorities receiving degrees in  SEM disciplines.  These programs included:  (1) AMP Scholars  Program, (2) Summer Research Internships, (3) AMP Drop-In Centers,  (4) AMP Mentoring Programs, (5) Faculty and Student Conferences,  (6) Alabama AMP Retention Study, and (7) Alabama AMP Science Day.   The Alliance was successful in increasing the number of graduates  in SEM disciplines, improving the quality of science education at  participation institutions, and increasing the student retention  rates of program participants at participating institutions.  AAMP  Phase I built a solid foundation for AAMP Phase II.  This  foundation will allow the Alliance to affect minority student  advancement through the critical decision points at the transition  between high school and college, 2-year and 4-year colleges and  undergraduate and graduate school.  In addition, collaborations  between the Alliance and National Laboratories and the Alabama  DOE/EPSCoR Program are planned.  Moreover, this foundation will  allow AAMP Phase II to address the problem of underrepres entation  of minorities in the mathematics and science teaching profession.   AAMP Phase II will include the following additional programs:  (1)  A Graduate School Bridge Program - designed to ease the transition  of minority students from college to graduate programs; (2) Summer  Bridge Program - designed to ease the transition of minority  students from high school and junior colleges to college; (3) AAMP  Research Outreach Program - designed to provide research experience  for minority students at National Laboratories and Research  Clusters of the Alabama DOE/EPSCoR Program, and (4) AAMP Teacher  Preparation Program - designed to attract minorities to the  mathematics and science teaching profession, to prepare them for  certification requirements, and to provide research experience in  teacher education.  During the last three years, all of the major  state universities joined AAMP.  This action will enhance the  success of AAMP Phase II and its impact on the higher education  system in Alabama.  AAMP Phase II will expand and goal of AAMP  Phase I to include graduate SEM degrees and undergraduate degrees  in mathematics and science education. The project will provide  significant cost-sharing, appropriate dissemination of activities,  and employ evaluation and assessment activities.",
