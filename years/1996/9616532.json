Tools will be developed that combine assessment functions with facilities to translate results of assessment into meaningful interventions in both physical and virtual classrooms.  The facilities include means of visualizing assessment of information for individual students and groups, means for organizing groups of students for particular activities, electronic mail exchanges, and means to help teachers articulate pedagogical goals and progress within the contexts of these groups.  The project experimentation will focus in the subject area of probability and statistics with the aim of enhancing the productivity and effectiveness of teachers in guiding their student groups in mastering the subject matter using Internet-based group discussion.",
