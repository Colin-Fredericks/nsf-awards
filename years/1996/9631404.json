 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631404  Karrer   DNA rearrangement is a basic biological process which occurs in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. The ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena, is a particularly advantageous system in which to study such rearrangements because the genome undergoes thousands of site specific DNA rearrangements which can be synchronously induced in large numbers of cells. Previous work in this laboratory has resulted in the cloning and characterization of DNA rearrangement fragment which contains a long, 825 bp inverted repeat near the junctions. Such repeats are found elsewhere in the micronuclear genome suggesting that they   are critical to the necessary DNA rearrangements needed to produce the macronucleus. Cloning and structural analysis of additional members of the Tir family of rearrangements will be done; cis-acting DNA sequences necessary and sufficient for DNA rearrangements will be identified and tested for function by transforming Tetrahymena with DNA constructs containing rearrangement junctions; and the mechanism of Tir1 rearrangement will be explored by searching for DNA intermediates.  %%%  Mechanisms which result in a rearrangement of DNA sequences can be more easily explored and understood using a single-celled model organism such as Tetrahymena. Such rearrangements of DNA genomes are common in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals and are often developmentally controlled, as they are in Tetrahymena. This work will give a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms which can be involved.  ***",
