The behavior  of  the  condensed  phases  of quantum liquids and  solids,  such  as  helium   and   hydrogen,  are  dominated  by   quantum   and  statistical  effects which are responsible for  many  unique  properties   such   as   superfluidity.    More    recently,  confinement  of  these systems in restricted geometries  has  shown  that  the  properties can be substantially  different  from  the  bulk.   Elastic and inelastic neutron  scattering  will be used to probe the microscopic structure and dynamics  of  these  phases.   This  work will  focus  on  the  helium  isotopes  (3He  and 4He), isotopic mixtures  (3He-4He),  and  hydrogen  (H2)  where the properties of the condensed  phase  are dominated by quantum effects.  Elastic and total neutron  scattering  measurements  will provide  information  on  the  spatial   correlation's.    Inelastic   neutron   scattering  measurements  will  be  used  to  study  diffusive   motion,  collective  excitations,  and the one-body  density  matrix.  (momentum  distribution).  Measurements will be carried  out  in  both bulk systems and for liquids and solids in confined  geometries such as porous Vycor glass, aerogels and solgels,  and zeolites.  %%%  Neutron  scattering  studies  of  quantum  systems  will  be  carried  out in this research project.  Quantum  solids  and  liquids, such as helium and hydrogen to be studied,  provide  a  useful  model  system for studying many  of  the  quantum  effects  that  are  found  in metals,  superconductors,  and  magnetic  materials.  However, they do not suffer  the  same  materials preparation problems so that the central  physical  principles are more easily extracted. Elastic and  inelastic  neutron  scattering  will be used to probe  the  microscopic  structure  and  dynamics of these solid and  liquid  phases.  These  measurements will provide information on  the  static  and   dy namic  interaction  of  helium  atoms  and  hydrogen  molecules in the condensed phases.  This work will focus  on  the  helium isotopes (3He and 4He), isotopic mixtures  (3He-  4He),  and  hydrogen  (H2) in both the bulk  phases  and  in  confined geometries.  ***",
