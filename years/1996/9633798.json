 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Office of Special Projects of the Chemistry   Division for continuing support of the collaborative research of Drs.   Pinnavaia, Kanatzidas, Billinge, Mahanti and Thorpe at Michigan State   University. Also participating is Dr. Stuart Solin of the NEC Research   Institute. The research deals broadly with chemical, physical and   computational aspects of ordered and lower dimensional nanoporous   materials based on oxides and chalcogenides. Specific research elements   that will be investigated are the synthesis of new metal oxide  (silica,   zirconia and titania) molecular sieves by self-assembly on neutral amine   or polyethylene oxide surfactant templates; synthesis by surfactant   templating, of new porous chalcogenide phases based on the pillaring of   lamelear metal sulfides and selenides; experimental X-ray diffraction and   computational studies of disorder and diffusion in open framework   mesostructures; studies of network stiffness by c-axis X-ray diffraction   and diffusion by inelastic neutron scattering of nanoporous silicate   networks; and, the synthesis and characterization of magnetic transition   metal layered double hydroxides. The synthetic studies of the metal   oxides will lead to molecular sieves with controlled phases and   morphologies ranging from hexagonal or cubic to worm-like channel motifs.   The chalcogenide studies directed towards the synthesis of layered metal   chalcogenide phases with  metal cluster  pillars will provide new   semiconducting catalysts with the shape selectivity of zeolites.  Nanoporous materials with pore sizes in the 1.0-10 nm range offer   exciting opportunities for the rational design of adsorbents and   catalysts for applications in environmental remediation, molecular   separations and a variety of industrial processes based on large molecule   transformations. Semiconducting nanoporous structures hold great promise   for the fabrication of sensors, organic -inorganic hybrid materials and   solid state devices. The properties and performance of these nanoporous   materials are dominated by  long and short range disorder and the   dimensionality of the pore space. This combined experimental and   computational study will help elucidate the fundamental chemistry and   physics of these complex materials.",
