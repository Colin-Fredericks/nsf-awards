In some situations the  processes must be carried out in a certain order, for example  when the output of one process is the input to another.  In other  situations, there may be several ways in which the processes  could be ordered, for example, if two responses are to be made  and there is a choice about which response to make first.  These  choices sometimes lead to scheduling problems.  Major scheduling  conflicts arise from competition for space in working memory,  where information relevant to an ongoing task is held for a short  time.  All evidence points to the conclusion that working memory  space is very limited, so that usually only one process can use  it actively at a time.  For example, there is evidence that  mental arithmetic cannot be carried out simultaneously with a  search of memory.      This research will explore the possibility that certain processes  can use working memory simultaneously.  The main processes of  interest are those that prepare or set up the working memory  space for processes that are immanent.  These preparation  processes operate behind the scenes, so to speak, and may not   make intensive demands for space themselves.  Preparatory  processes of special interest are those that schedule the  upcoming processes.  One hypothesis to be tested is whether  preparation of upcoming processes can be carried out  simultaneously with other ongoing processing.    This research would not be feasible if it were not possible to  figure out whether covert mental processes are executed  concurrently or sequentially, and, if they are sequential, what  the order of execution is.  A methodology for doing this, Latent  Network Theory, was developed in previous research.  It is based  on reaction time and other performance measures.      While this research is fundamental in na ture, it will help us  understand the performance of humans in the sorts of speeded  tasks that arise in all manner of practical arenas, such as the  operation of complex equipment, and the design of those tasks  (and the relevant equipment) so that they build on the  capabilities of the humans who will have to perform them.    ***",
