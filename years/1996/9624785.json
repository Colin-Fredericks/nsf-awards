Han    Microwave Nondestructive Testing    Research in advanced microwave nondestructive testing for the inspection of civil engineering structures and modern composite materials will be performed.  The following aspects will be developed (1) application of theoretical models to properly characterize the scattering process in complex constructions consisting of both small-scale random inhomogeneities and large-scale deterministic structures; (2) development of an adaptive coherent microwave imaging algorithm to efficiently retrieve host medium properties, structural information and the locations and characteristics of any embedded defects; and (3) employment of the probability of detection concept to measure the effectiveness and reliability of microwave inspection under the prescribed conditions.  The significance of the proposed research is that it systematically integrates the knowledge in the forefront of microwave remote sensing and data processing research to construct a practical microwave imaging system.  The ultimate contributions that will be made by this program are to the upkeep of the aging national physical infrastructure as well as maintaining the leading position of U.S. manufacturers through improving their capability of quality assurance and process control.",
