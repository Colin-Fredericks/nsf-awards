 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manteuffel  9528039         The researcher and his colleagues organize a conference  devoted to iterative methods for the solution of linear and  nonlinear systems of equations.  Particular themes are  nonsymmetric linear systems, globally convergent algorithms for  nonlinear systems, algorithms of optimal order of work, and  applications on multiprocessor computer architectures.       The mathematical description of real-world problems leads  inevitably to equations to solve.  Many times the equations are  nonlinear ones, arising because the underlying problem is  nonlinear.  Often, however, the original problem is linear and  the mathematical equations are too.  Such problems arise in all  areas of science and technology, and are of special interest in  biology, materials, environmental studies, and manufacturing.    Progress in these areas requires solution of more comprehensive  modeling equations, or more accurate solution of existing models.  In either case, these needs increase the size of the equations or  their nonlinearity.  The conference addresses advances in  algorithms to deal with the bigger size of the equations,  nonlinearities, the amount of time and work needed to get a  solution, and the possible use of multiprocessor computers.",
