 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, explores the interfacial chemistry of polymers  on solid surfaces using surface Raman spectroscopy as the primary  tool.  The work focusses on the interaction of polyimides  deposited on copper and chromium surfaces, and on their oxides.   A molecular understanding of the bonding interaction is the goal  of these studies, which will help to explain properties of these  polymer metal systems such as adhesion.  Additionally, an  important goal of this project is the elucidation of the chemical  mechanism of the surface enhanced Raman process.  Connections  will be made between the electronic structure of surface adsorbed  species as probed by high resolution electron loss spectroscopy  and the Raman enhanced spectra of a series of molecules adsorbed  on silver, copper, and gold surfaces.  The study of the interfacial chemistry of polymers adsorbed on  metal and metal oxide surfaces is the focus of this project  supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program.  The  polyimide on copper system, an important one in electronic  materials processing applications, is the primary interface  investigated.  Raman spectroscopy will be used to probe this  interface, and an additional focus of the work is the development  of a detailed understanding of the chemical mechanism of surface  Raman enhancement.",
