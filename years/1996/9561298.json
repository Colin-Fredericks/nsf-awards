 "awd_abstract_narration": "9561298  Rabinovich   The ultimate product of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is a module for training adolescent drivers appropriate skills of risk perception and evaluation incorporating the features that have been lacking in failed past attempts; namely, (a) direct relationship to current research and theory on adolescent cognition and risk behavior; (b) adoption of successful strategies from other domains of youthful risk behavior (e.g., drugs, violence, sexual behavior); and (c) flexibility to adapt to the current driver education system which is now diverse, often informal, and conducted within non-educational as well as various educational settings.  The aim of this Phase I effort is to provide basic information about how youth evaluate risks in different traffic situations in the laboratory and on the road; identify strategies utilized in successful prevention/intervention programs for risky behavior (e.g., driving, substance use, etc.); and develop guidelines for a modular risk decision component of driver training.  The modular unit will contain transportable low-tech training that can be used in a variety of settings (e.g., school, home, commercial driver training establishments, community sites, and testing sites).  This information will be utilized to achieve the major goal of the next phase of the project which will produce a training module for young novice drivers.   The proposed product has commercial application for training young novice drivers to perceive risky traffic situations.  It would have applicability to a variety of settings including high school health classes, commercial driver training, and community settings.",
