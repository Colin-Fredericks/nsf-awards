 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a real-time, interactive flight test program based on an active Flight Test Engineering program being conducted at the University of Florida (UF). Using a Cessna 172 aircraft configured with a unique instrumentation system, participants are performing airborne experiments at UF and doing much of the data reduction and analysis in real time on board the aircraft. Part of the project involves sending video and other sensor data from the aircraft to classrooms at four universities using video-conferencing, so that the classes may actively participate in a real-time flight test. Each group has the opportunity to act as \"mission control\" and direct the experiment at least once. All of the schools are in simultaneous video and voice contact with the other stations and in voice contact with the aircraft during the experiments. Member schools are developing and proposing additional flight test experiments.",
