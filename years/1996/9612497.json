 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612497  Ilegbusi       Processing of materials in the semi-solid state has become a potentially attractive means of producing near net-shape parts.  It is often achieved by controlling the microstructure from segregation prone alloys.  However, there still exists a lack of understanding of the rheology and flow characteristics of the semi-solid state.  The slurries often exhibit fractionation at mold extension and narrow sections.  This phenomenon contributes to inhomogeneity of constitutive response and consequently produces unacceptable differential solidification and non-uniform mechanical properties in the solidified product.  The research project addresses these issues by developing models to study the non-isothermal constitutive relationship for semi-solid slurries.  Two test materials will be investigated: a tin-lead alloy and an aluminum-copper alloy.  These materials will be studied both in the absence and presence of externally-imposed particulates of silicon carbide and aluminum oxide.  A parallel experiment will be carried out to study the mold-filling characteristics under a range of operating conditions.       This project has a balance between theory and experiment and could have a  practical impact to the near-net shape engineering in manufacturing.",
