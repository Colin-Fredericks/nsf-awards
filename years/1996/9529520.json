Yen, Kang    Florida International University    CISE  Research Instrumentation: Multiprocessor Workstation for Advanced Digital Signal Processing  Research    Emerging Digital Signal Processing techniques are being applied to the solution of  challenging problems of signal detection and system modeling: Dynamic neural networks are  used as  spatio-temporal classifiers for the detection of electroencephalographic (EEG)  patterns that can be elicited voluntarily, as part of the process of motion preparation.  Reliable detection of these patterns will provide the basis for the development of a new  form of computer interface that will be accessible even to individuals deprived of motor  execution functions. Similarly, chaotic dynamics analysis is being applied for the detailed  study of the three-dimensional propagation of ocean acoustic waves. Indices such as the  Lyapunov exponent are numerically estimated using real sound propagation data collected in  the North Atlantic to characterize the chaotic properties of the phenomenon. While these  emerging DSP techniques hold great promise to increase our capability to obtain useful  information from signals and develop accurate models of physical phenomena, they are  complex and computationally intensive. The availability of multiprocessor workstations is  necessary to shorten the algorithm development and analysis cycles (i.e., large-scale  dynamic neural network training, numerical Lyapunov exponent estimation, etc.) to practical  levels. Additionally, these systems will familiarize our faculty and students with parallel  algorithm development techniques",
