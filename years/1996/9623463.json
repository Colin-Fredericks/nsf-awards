Also the role of  particle-like objects in the Yang-Mills Higgs equations and other systems    will be studied. These equations are essentially systems of parabolic  and hyperbolic type  respectively. One of the aims of the work is to   understand how the dynamical properties of the ``particles''  are  reflected in the analytical properties of the equations. This is    interesting since the particles represent a genuinely nonlinear  effect. The particle-like objects are solutions which are independent  of time and are characterized by a  topological winding number.  Reduced descriptions of the dynamics of these ``particles''    in terms of finite dimensional systems  have been obtained together  with rigorous bounds  on the validity of the approximations. These  allow an understanding of the forces between the ``particles'' and  also their scattering properties.  This in turn leads to an    understanding of the original equations, in particular to conjectures  and theorems about the large time behavior of the solutions. In turn  it is to be hoped that a study of the large  time behavior of these  equations may be a useful tool in analyzing the static particle-like  solutions themselves.   %%%    In mathematical descriptions of the physical world there is a division  between ``fields'' and ``particles''. The former are continuous media  in which information propagates in a  wave-like fashion, while the  latter are discrete objects. However certain equations which give a  ``field'' description of some physical situation have solutions which  are themselves ``particle-like''. This provides a bridge between the  two types of description. A real world situation in which this occurs  is superconductivity: vortices appear in superconductors as  particle-like objects within a continuum description. They are very   important in technological applications of superconductors because the  vortices produce a resistance to passage of current through the  material and hence reduce the efficacy of the material in modern  technology. It is therefore extremely important to be able to    understand the interactions of vortices with each other and with the  rest of the material in order to fully realize the great technological  potential of superconducting materials in  high speed computer design,  power transmission,  modern rail systems and other areas.  ***",
