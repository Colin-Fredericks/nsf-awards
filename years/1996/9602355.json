 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Midwest Regional Consortium for Advanced Technology Education supports a new focus for promoting excellence in faculty development in technology education. This focus enhances America's competitive position as world-class in manufacturing and industrial distribution technology by developing the technical and pedagogical skills of faculty members from high schools, community colleges, and universities. This project is providing an opportunity for faculty development through workshops and seminars offered at numerous locations in the Midwest. The faculty involved in these seminars benefit from the existing laboratories and facilities available in Purdue's School of Technology. Faculty and teachers are learning new technologies and pedagogical skills which benefit students in advanced technology fields from high school through graduate study. This provides an opportunity to better educate the future industrial work force and develop technology faculty members for the future.    In addition to the faculty development, the project is creating and adapting innovative curriculum and instructional materials to benefit advanced technological education.    Project partners with Purdue include Cincinnati State Technical Community College in Ohio, Macomb Community College in Michigan, Parkland and Triton Community Colleges in Illinois, St. Louis Community College in Missouri, and Vincennes University in Indiana as well as numerous secondary schools and industries.",
