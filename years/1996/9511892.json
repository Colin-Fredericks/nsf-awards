 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is directed towards the development of  mathematical and computational tools for the geometric  analysis of molecular conformation, kinematics and dynamics.  The resulting algorithms and computer programs are expected  to be of widespread utility to researchers in many areas of  structural chemistry and biochemistry, including  spectroscopists seeking to interpret their data in terms of  a precise molecular model, stereochemists who need to find  all conformers consistent with a given  bond arrangement,  molecular biologists attempting to predict protein and  nucleic acid conformation, and theoreticians studying their  dynamics.  The overall approach combines established methods  of conformational analysis based on distance geometry with  one of the most important tools of modern theoretical  physics: Clifford algebra.  In previous publications, we  have shown how distance geometry can be understood within  the broader framework of Clifford algebra, and how the  Clifford algebra of three-dimensional Euclidian space can be  used to solve important problems in modern conformational  analysis.  We have also shown how the martix exponential and  related matrix-valued functions can be used to compute the  necessary transformations, and have developed efficient  algorithms for them.    Specific research activities planned for the award period  include: (1) Conformational analysis in four dimensions, (2)  Mobius sphere distance geometry, and (3) Kinematics of  internal molecular motions.",
