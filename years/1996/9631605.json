 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr.  Karen Goldberg, Department of Chemistry, University of Washington,   is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the Chemistry Division under a Career Advancement Award to study the   energetics and mechanisms of reductive elimination reactions from Pt(IV)   metal centers. Reductive elimination is a fundamental reaction step in   organometallic chemistry occurring as the product release step in   homogeneous catalytic processes. The goal of this project is to gain a   general and practical understanding of the controlling factors of   reductive elimination and to develop predictive capabilities of   reactivity applicable to a wide variety of substituents.  This work will   advance Dr. Goldberg's career by providing a basis for preparing a   competitive NSF research proposal subsequent to the completion of this   Career Advancement Award.  Catalytic reactions involving metal ions such as platinum and palladium   are common in organic synthesis and provide for the formation of   carbon-carbon bonds, for example.  These reactions require that organic   fragments first add to the metal complex, then react in some fashion,   followed by release of a functionalized molecule.  The release step,   known as reductive elimination, is of fundamental importance, yet the   factors affecting it are not well understood.  Systematic studies of this   step will be performed to gain a fundamental understanding of the   mechanism of this process, and to enhance the ability to predict the   outcomes of these reactions.",
