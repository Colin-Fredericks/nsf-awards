 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research includes two projects to study the influence of  chromosome structure on chromosome behavior and gene expression in  Drosophila.  The first project focuses on the pal and K81 proteins  which are required to stably maintain paternal chromosomes during  embryogenesis.  To analyze their mechanism of action, their  subcellular localization is being followed during spermatogenesis  and embryogenesis, using hybrid proteins generated by fusions with  the fluorescent GFP marker.  Methods to mark sperm DNA will be  developed to track paternal chromosome behavior in K81 mutant  backgrounds.  For the second project, the organization of a large  chromosomal domain is being studied through the structural analysis  of a genetically well characterized region of heterochromatin.   Molecular mapping and selected cloning of sequences within this  heterochromatic region should allow specific DNA sequences to be  correlated with the functional properties of heterochromatin.    Interactive activities include:  teaching a graduate course,  informal interactions with faculty and students, and organizing a  workshop for graduate students and postdocs that focus on issues  that affect their training and career choices.  The workshops are  intended to stimulated productive discussions and offer practical  solutions to problems young scientists may encounter at different  stages of their careers.",
