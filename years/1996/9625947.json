 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625947  Scharberg    This project continues the tradition of the prior teacher in-  service programs associated with the Biennial Conferences on  Chemical Education sponsored by the Division of Chemical Education  of the American Chemical Society.  Because the location of the  Biennial Conference changes from year to year the target group also  changes and consists of those teachers of chemistry within a 3-4  hour driving time of the conference.  The up-coming conference will  be held at Clemson University.  The project will serve 55  participants and especially those teachers who are (1) teaching out  of field; (2) professionally or geographically isolated; (3) and  teaching large numbers of underrepresented students.  The major  goals of the proposal are to stimulate and encourage these teachers  to join professional groups, to participate in a regional network  dedicated to issues in chemical education, to become involved in  the mainstream of chemical education and thus to participate in the  national movement to improve science education at the high school  level.  The teachers in the project will be involved in an  intensive series of workshops before during and after the Biennial  Conference.  They are also expected to attend the Conference  Sessions and two follow-up sessions six months apart.  Ten Lead  Teachers from the region, selected on the basis of their  demonstrated excellence in teaching and professional development  history will lead the Operation Progress workshops, serve as  mentors and information sources to the participants and manage the  networking component of the program.  Matching funds constitute about 315% of the NSF grant.",
