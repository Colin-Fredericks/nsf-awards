 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553542  Kahn    The Burke Museum at the University if Washington will develop  Pacific Voices, a 5500 sq. ft. exhibit that will focus on the issue  of cultural identity.  It will encourage visitors to examine the  definition of American cultural identity, the integration of  diverse cultural elements within American communities, and  questions regarding interactions between Native peoples and Euro-  Americans.  Four themes (Teachers, Elders, and Authority; Language;  Oral Traditions; and Ceremonies) will be developed to help visitors  understand cultural identify, tradition and change in the context  of Pacific Region cultures.  The extensive collections and  professional resources of the Burke Museum will be used and the  exhibit will be used.  Building on established linkages between the  Seattle school systems and the museum, the Burke staff will  introduce new teacher/student guides and a varied menu of teacher  training activities including for-credit courses and in-serviced  programs that will address the social science literacy benchmarks  of Project 2061.  Other outreach activities will include traveling  study collections, weekend family programs, a resource bank in the  museum's Department of Education and locally and nationally  disseminated radio and television news and feature programs related  to the theme of Pacific Voices.",
