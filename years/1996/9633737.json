 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objects are  programming abstractions that encapsulate  mutable internal  state and provide operations to manipulate the state.  Object-based computing  is the programming paradigm that uses objects to structure  the state-manipulation  carried out in programs.  The goal of this project is to  develop formal methods  for specifying, conceptualizing, and reasoning about object-  based programs.  These formal methods include:  (1) Type systems:  what kinds  of semantic entities  are involved in object-based programs, and how does one  capture them in type  systems for programming languages?  (2) Denotational  semantics:  what mathematical  abstractions are involved in capturing the bahaviors of  object-based programs?  (3) Specifications:  How does one specify the behaviors of  individual objects?  (4) Reasoning methods:  what methods are appropriate and  useful for proving properties  of object-based programs?    The Direction being pursued is to build on the several  decades of research in  functional programming so as ato achieve a \"tight  integration\" of programming  concepts and mathmatical tools in working with object-based  programs.  Of  primary focus are algebraic specification and equational  reasoning techniques  using lambda-calculus-based higher-order language  frameworks. ***",
