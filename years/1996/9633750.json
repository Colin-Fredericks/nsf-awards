 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633750  Buck    The intent of this proposal is to seek funding for the support of  the Nuclear/High Energy Physics (NuHEP) Research Center of  Excellence of Hampton University for the next five years.  The long  range goal is to maintain an internationally competitive research  program in nuclear and high energy physics.  The Center was  established in September 1991 through a cooperative agreement with  the National Science Foundation.  The Center has met or exceeded  all of its original goals of that time and enjoys additional  funding from the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility  (CEBAF) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  One of the  original goals was to establish a Ph.D. Degree program at Hampton;  this goal has been met and the University is now in its fourth year  of that program, boasting a total of 45 graduate students in the  Department.  The NuHEP Center has established solid collaborative  programs with a variety of academic institutions and laboratories  in the United States and abroad.  The NuHEP Center has been used as  a model for the establishment of similar programs at other  Historically Black Colleges/Universities (HBCUs), as well as major  institutions.  The nuclear physics program has grown rapidly over  the past 12 years.  It has been demonstrated that high quality work  in nuclear physics can be performed at Hampton.  NSF renewed  funding of the Center offers the opportunity for the Center to  maintain and grow intellectually as a quality program.",
