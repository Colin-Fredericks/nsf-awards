 "awd_abstract_narration": "The teaching of undergraduate mathematics courses for future school  teachers is being enriched by week-long summer workshops for  college and university faculty in which they will:  Goal 1.   experience new teaching strategies and techniques.  Goal 2.   experience examples of non-test based assessment schemes.  Goal 3.   learn about and observe these and other examples of pedagogical  techniques that have been successful in encouraging women and  underrepresented minorities to excel in mathematics.  Goal 4.   learn new subject matter and experience new instructional materials  being produced by the Cornell Undergraduate Geometry Project which  relate both modern and rarely studied geometry topics with the  mathematics subject matter of the middle and high schools.  Goal 5.   have the opportunity to interact and share with colleagues and  experts who have common interests in the teaching of mathematics to  future school teachers, and to develop plans to incorporate both  teaching techniques and new curricular materials into their own  courses.  Goal 6.  learn about and share ideas concerning the  recent recommendations, guidelines and standards put forth by the  Mathematical Sciences Education Board (MSEB), the National Council  of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), and in publications of the  Mathematical Association of America (MAA) concerning changes in the  teaching of undergraduate mathematics.  Goal 7.  be committed to  participate after the workshop in several of the planned follow-up  activities.",
