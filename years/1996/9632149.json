 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Planning Grant project is concerned with the chemistry of   redox dependent hydrogen bonding.  As such, there are potential   applications in materials chemistry and in analytical chemistry.  The   work will be carried out by Dr. Diane K. Smith and her students at San   Diego State University.  The project is supported by the Analytical and   Surface Chemistry Program and the Special Projects Office in the   Chemistry Division.  Since hydrogen bonds have substantial electrostatic   character, the change in charge produced by a redox reaction can   substantially affect the strength of a hydrogen bond involving an atom at   the charge site  The goals of this research are to identify   donor-acceptor pairs which fit this description, and to exploit the   findings in a number of ways including new approaches to derivitization   reactions on electrode surfaces, the use of electrocrystallization for   self assembly on electrode surfaces, and control of the liquid crystal   film character of a surface film.  Among the aims of these investigations   are sensor development, control of supramolecular structure, and redox   controlled filtration systems.   This research seeks ways to control the strength of hydrogen bonding by   manipulating the charge on one of the atoms involved in the hydrogen   bond.  The PI will use oxidation-reduction reactions to accomplish the   change in charge.  By focusing on chemistry at surfaces, it may be   possible to develop devices and materials whose properties can be rapidly   changed  by simple changes in oxidation state.  This would lead to a   number of possible applications in analytical and materials chemistry.",
