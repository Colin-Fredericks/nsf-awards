 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Chad A. Mirkin, Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division to perform studies of redox-active ligands with   transition metals.  The ligands, known as redox-switchable hemilabile   ligands (RHLs), are designed to yield electrochemical control over the   steric and electronic environment of the transition metals to which they   are bound.  The magnitude of these effects will be quantified, and the   relative importance of electrostatic and inductive effects in binding   affinity changes resulting from the redox chemistry will be assessed.    Electrochemical control of chemical transformations that occur at late   transition metal centers is the ultimate objective.  Potential   applications for these complexes include catalytic olefin hydrogenation,   asymmetric olefin hydrogenation, hydrosilation, hydrocyanation, and   methanol carbonylation.    Compounds containing metal ions such as rhodium which are bound to   molecules containing phosphorus, oxygen and sulfur atoms have been found   to be particularly useful catalysts, and this results from the fact that   one part of the molecule binds much more strongly than the other part.    The objective of this project is to synthesize new molecules of this   sort, known as redox-switchable hemilabile ligands, where the binding of   the ligand can be controlled by the addition or abstraction of an   electron to or from a redox active substituent on the ligand itself.    Because the oxidation state of the ligand can be controlled quite easily   using electrochemistry, this could provide an additional element of   control to the catalytic reactions, making the catalysts either more or   less reactive depending on the oxidation state.  The increased level of   control is expected to have important implications for industrially   important catalytic processes.",
