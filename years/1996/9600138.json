 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600138  Gorman    It has now become an important but unanswered question as to  whether molecules (or macromolecule at the 1-10 nm size scale)  can be addressed and reliably store information. New techniques,  particularly scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), will certainly  have use in these schemes. Nanolithography of metallic or  semiconducting phases to create depressions or mounds on a  surface can represent binary information, but atoms can diffuse,  destroying this information. Ideally, information-bearing  molecules could be moved into place and anchored to a surface.  Subsequently, they could be switched and read without being  influenced by their surroundings. In this project, both the  molecular requirements and the process requirements for such a  scheme will be addressed. In the former area, a new nanoscale  unit will be synthesized. It is designed to be switchable,  isolated from nearby units (so that the information it contains  will not become scrambled), readable by an STM tip, and easily  positioned on a surface (and thus addressable). It is argued that  all of these criteria must be fulfilled before a molecule-based  system can function as an information storage device. The  molecule designed for this purpose will contain an electroactive  core inside a dendrimeric polymer. This hybrid molecule will have  an isolated, switchable information unit and simultaneously an  easily tailored size, shape, and surface. Simultaneously, in the  process area, methods for using the STM tip to perform chemical  transformations on an organic surface (fashioned using  self-assembled monolayers of organothiols on gold) will be  explored. Rather than etching the surface, it is argued that  site-specific reductive desorption of the organothiols into a  solution over the surface will permit more predictable, reliable  control over positioning of molecules on a surface. Both of these  project segments will be directed towards demonstrations of those  requirements for molecule-based information  storage on a surface.  %%%  As computing elements become smaller and smaller, one must devise  ways to encode information in smaller spaces. At least as far as  strictly spatial encoding is concerned, the two most obvious  schemes for nanoscale information storage are (a) continued  miniaturization of known microscale elements to approach the  nanoscale or (b) tailoring existing nanoscale objects  e.g.  molecules  so that they can function as information bearing units  (IBUs). In this proposal, macromolecular objects will be  described that are tailored to serve as switchable, addressable,  and organizable IBUs. It will be argued that only such a system  will be suitable for use in nanoscale information encoding  schemes.  ***",
