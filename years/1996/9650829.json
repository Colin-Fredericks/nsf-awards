 "awd_abstract_narration": "At San Diego State University, about 450 preservice elementary teachers take one or more specially designed undergraduate courses in either physics, geology or biology each year. These courses incorporate extensive class discussion, hands-on experimentation, collaborative learning and the use of computers in creative ways.  The computer equipment obtained with NSF support are enabling the course instructors to develop and integrate more advanced multimedia to enhance the science learning experiences of the students in many new and exciting ways. The physics courseis using the new computers with powerful new software developed on another project to help students construct conceptual models in various domains of physics. This new software provides tools for knowledge construction and simulations of physics phenomena. Students working in groups build physics understanding by using idea containers, electronic journals, bulletin boards and World Wide Web resources to promote meaningful conversations as part of learning. They make predictions about experimental outcomes and test their predictions with both actual apparatus and computer simulations. The geology course is furthering integration of hands-on collaborative learning with multimedia and World Wide Web resources through enhancement and further development of the World Wide Web page called TREES (Teaching Resources for Education in Earth Science). CD-ROMs are being used to explore Earth Science, and student field experiences are being used to create virtual field trips that are available on the Web. The biology course is promoting meaningful learning by engaging students in using their experiential knowledge to construct semantic networks. Using new multimedia tools and the latest version of the software SemNet, students are able to build networks that incorporate images, QuickTime movies and Web resources all  stored on CD and made available on the Web. Results of development efforts in all three courses are being disseminated widely through  many channels, including Web pages, other teacher enhancement projects, and professional meetings and publications. A particular effort will be made to share resources with other faculty in the California State University system, which graduates nearly 3,000 future K-6 teachers every year.",
