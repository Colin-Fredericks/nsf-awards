Software Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) architectures strike a balance between the distributed-memory and shared memory architectures by providing an abstraction of shared memory in software on distributed memories.  They are built using standard processors/workstations and they are easy to program using a shared address space based on virtual memory pages.  DSM systems are suitable for many parallel scientific applications.  Although many systems have been designed, only the scalability issues for hardware shared-memory systems have been addressed.    For software DSM systems, the focus has been on performance with a moderate number of nodes using relaxed memory consistency models and multiple-writers protocols.  Most experiments have been on 8 nodes and a few with 16 nodes.  When going from 8 to 64 or more nodes, each  may have multiple processors, scalability problems exist with the current size of data structures and their allocation and deallocation.  A scalable DSM should only capture actual causality of modifications, minimize space overhead per shared page, and the address space should be dynamically partitioned.  We plan to analyze and build a scalable DSM system to run on a distributed-memory machine with 64 nodes and a fast interconnect.  ***",
