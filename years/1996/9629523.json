 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theories that have been postulated for the evolution of eusociality in insects are rarely applicable to termites, which are taxonomically and ecologically remote from the ants, bees and wasps.  Based on her studies of subsocial cockroaches, Dr. Nalepa has hypothesized that the manner in which nitrogenous materials are distributed during trophic interactions in incipient colonies of termites is the proximate cause of the reproductive and developmental changes associated with attaining eusocial status.  Dr. Nalepa will test this hypothesis using the Australian termite Mastotermes darwiniensis.  Through behavioral observations, measurements of individuals and colonies, colony manipulations and chemical analysis of the food and secretions involved in the care of dependents, she will quantify how the reserves of the adults, the demands of the developing brood and the input from the first workers in the colony are interrelated, and how these parameters change as the young family makes the transition to eusociality.  Dr. Nalepa's research employs a cross-disciplinary approach in analyzing termite social behavior, in that it attempts to relate ecology and nutritional physiology to behavior and social structure.  These studies will substantially contribute to our understanding of the affinities between cockroaches and termites, but also bear on much wider issues in the biological and social sciences.  The analysis of eusociality in insects has always played a central role in the analysis of sociality in all animals, and indeed, of evolution itself.  Clarifying the proximate causes of eusociality in the traditionally neglected termites may provide biologists with new ammunition in characterizing the origins of social systems.",
