The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will fund a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Johan B. Bergenholtz's work  with Professor Rudolf Klein at the Universitat Konstanz in  Germany.        An understanding of the fundamental dynamical processes in  colloidal suspensions is important to the formulation of  engineering models for the design and optimization of  processes involving suspensions of colloidal-sized  particles, such as proteins, paints, pigments, and coatings.  This understanding is lacking in the case of suspensions and  microemulsions when attractive interparticle interactions  are strong.  The proposed research will extend existing  dynamical suspension theories, developed for charged  colloidal suspensions, to include systems with attractive  interactions.  Dynamic light scattering experiments will be  used to assess the success of the theoretical developments.  This study will elucidate the suspension dynamics near the  percolation transition and will provide a better foundation  for analyzing the role of colloidal forces on macroscopic  suspension properties.  ***",
