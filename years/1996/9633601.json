 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anandakrishnan  9633601    Abstract    This award supports a workshop on Aerogeophysical Research in  Antarctica to be held 18-19 March, 1996, at the National Science  Foundation offices in Arlington, Virginia.    The National Science Foundation has established a facility to  collect airborne geophysical data in Antarctica.  The Support  Office for Aerogeophysical Research (SOAR) (administered by the  Institute for Geophysics of the University of Texas at Austin)  operates state-of-the-art instruments for ice-surface elevation,  ice thickness, gravity, and magnetics on board a ski-equipped  Twin Otter aircraft.  This workshop will bring together earth  scientists and glaciologists to discuss the best possible use of  these tools and these types of data.    To date the facility has been used with great success in the West  Antarctic to image the Byrd Basin/Ross Embayment region.  This  area is a key to both glaciologic problems of ice sheet stability  and ice stream flow as well as tectonic problems of Gondwana  reconstructions and West Antarctic rifting.  Identifying other  such intersections of cross-discipline problems will be of great  importance in the long-term viability of SOAR.    This facility can be used in reconnaisance mode to map the  magnetic, gravity, and ice-thickness signatures of large areas or  as a high-resolution mapper to characterize in detail areas of  particular interest.  These two modes of operation are distinct  in philosophy and we will discuss the pros and cons of each mode.    The practical aspects of data handling, data visualization, and  final product delivery from SOAR will also be discussed.  The  different customers of SOAR require different levels of analysis  or integration of the data streams available.  These and other  issues of data delivery will be discussed.    The specific goals of the workshop are: 1) Educate the Antarctic  science community on the capabilities and limitations of the SOAR  facility; 2) Identify and prioritize research objectives of b road  interest and possibly global applicability that would be best  studied in the Antarctic using aerogeophysical data; 3) Link the  research goals of geologists and glaciologists to identify areas  of the Antarctic where these data would be of value to both  communities; and 4) Encourage the development of coordinated  proposals for future use of SOAR.",
