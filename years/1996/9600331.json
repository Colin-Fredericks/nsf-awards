 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600331  Maruyama    This award supports the collaboration of Dr. Kimiaki  Maruyama of the Gene Evaluation and Mapping Laboratory at  Beltsville Agricultural Research Center and Dr. Mitsuru  Naito of the Department of Animal Breeding and Genetics,  National Institute of Animal Industry (NIAI).  Project  funding will enable Dr. Maruyama to spend one year in Japan,  resident at NIAI, to determine cellular functions of  myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) in chicken embryonic  cells and whole embryos.  Dr. Maruyama has previously  studied muscle protein  gene expression and the expression of genes encoding MRFs  which are implicated in directing embryonic cells to muscle  cell lineage and activating muscle protein genes.  Dr. Naito  has successfully cultured chicken embryos in vitro to open  an avenue to study gene functions in developing embryos.  Dr. Maruyama will combine his expertise with that of Dr.  Naito to pursue the research objectives.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of avian embryo development.  The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to become  familiar with research techniques, equipment, and facilities  at NIAI while contributing to the overall research effort.  Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the  Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge  through  international collaboration.",
