 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stephen Kukolich of The University of Arizona is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform high resolution   fourier-transform microwave (FTMW) spectroscopic studies of transition   (TM) hydrides, metal-olefin complexes, non-rigid complexes, dinuclear   complexes and organometallic radicals.  In the first case, TM complexes   containing two hydrogen atoms will be investigated, with an eye towards   distinguishing between `dihydrogen` complexes (the hydrogen-hydrogen bond   remains intact) versus dihydrides (hydrogen atoms bond independently to   the metal, and are separated by much larger distances).  Data will be   analyzed to provide information on the three-dimensional structures,   internal motion, quadrupole coupling constants and dipole moments of the   molecules under study.   Most of the systems that will be investigated were chosen to help in   modeling and understanding the chemistry and interactions of transition   metals in catalytic and enzyme systems.  Metal hydrides are often quite   reactive and play important roles in many industrial processes.  The   electronic and structural changes in olefins on complexation to metals   play an important part in catalytic processes.  Efficient production of a   large fraction of industrial chemicals depends on one or more catalytic   processes.  The active sites of many enzymes which are essential for   living systems involve various transition metal complexes.",
