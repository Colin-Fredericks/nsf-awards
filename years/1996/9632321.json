 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) will develop a comprehensive  after-school program that be an extension of its \"RiverGirls\" four-  week ecology-based summer camp.  The ASSETS Project will enable 24  to 48 of the girls who participated in the RiverGirls Camp to  engage in two, twelve-week after school program sequences that will  provide them with in-depth science contact, multiple experiences  with technology and tools, and opportunities to develop more  positive relationships with peers and role models who reflect their  own cultural identities.  A special focus of the project includes  incorporating participants' parents in an active and fundamental  way in their daughters; educational experience at the museum.  This  involvement is designed to help parents provide increased support  to their daughters' in science and math education.    The girls who complete the ASSETS Project will be recruited into  other science and math enrichment programs for youth at the museum.   Overall project and program design will be based on recent  resiliency research that has shown youth from any background who  grow up with a key combination of assets, including personal  qualities, a supportive environment, and acquired skills, will have  a better chance to make the transition to successful and productive  adulthood.",
