 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625087  One of the greatest needs of in situ remediation  technologies is the  development of systems that will overcome the commonly poor  rates of  contaminant extraction from highly sorptive and low  permeability zones.  In  most common remediation technology, \"pump and treat,\" fluid  extraction  rates are high but the contaminant removal rates are largely  controlled by  the relatively slow processes of diffusion and desorption  from  heterogeneous zones.  This research is devoted to two of the  most important  heterogeneity types:  contaminated clay lenses in a  productive aquifer, and  a sandy layer or fractured zone in a relatively impermeable  media.  Two  emerging strategies will be investigated:  electroosmotic  enhancements  applied to a clay lens; and a novel, safe, abiotic reagent  chemistry that  can be injected into fractures and sandy zones.  While the  fundamentals of  each technology are well-defined, this work will demonstrate  how the two  technologies can be integrated to obtain electroosmotic  enhancement with in  situ abiotic degradation.    The chief educational objective is to develop and integrate  the common  scientific and engineering fundamentals that are important  for a wide array  of geoenvironmental problems.  The PI will develop  geoenvironmental  curriculum strategies, broaden the exposure of new research  methods, and  work to strengthen the analytical training of students.  Collaborations  with industry and government agencies will greatly enhance  these  educational and research plans.  ***",
