 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program is supporting Edward R. Grant   of Purdue University to continue his research on state-to-state   photoionization and the dynamics of intramolecular relaxation in highly   excited states of small molecules.  Systems to be studied include a set   of fundamentally important oxy-hydrocarbon and metal-centered free   radicals, relevant as intermediates in air pollution, combustion and   electronic materials processing.  Multiresonant excitation techniques   will be used to make high-resolution spectroscopic measurements of   resonant lineshapes and positions for final states coupled to ionization   and dissociation continua.  These observations will lay an experimental   foundation for collaborative theoretical work, designed to achieve a   fundamental understanding of the interaction between core-vibrational and   extravalent-electronic degrees of freedom, and to determine the source of   mode selectivity in the vibrational autoionization of polyatomic   molecules.  Photoselection and specialized detection methods will also be   used to study rovibrational structure in the electronic ground states of   cations and precursor free-radicals:  zero-kinetic-energy threshold   photoionization measurements will establish vibrational-rotational level   spectra of closed-shell oxy-hydrocarbon cations, characterizing potential   energy surfaces and anharmonic coupling from zero-points to thresholds   for intramolecular proton transfer.  Similar measurements on Group III   hydride cations will follow progressions of vibrational resonances up to   and beyond thresholds for diatomic hydrogen elimination.    Vibration-rotation spectra obtained by state-to-state photoionization -   bleaching methods will address outstanding issues of structure and   symmetry in free-radical ground states.    The detailed dynamics of energy transfer between electronic and   internuclear degrees of freedom has significant practical consequences.    In nature, for example, photosynthesis begins with selective   intramolecular energy migration, followed by charge separation and   electron transfer.  In an extension of his previous research effort,   Grant will now include studies on main-group free radical systems, chosen   for their relevance to thermochemical issues in combustion, atmospheric   chemistry and electronic materials processing.    As an example, the   group III radical hydrides mentioned above are important intermediates in   the metallization and p-doping of silicon devices by chemical vapor   deposition.",
