 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627047  Mahaffy       The principal investigator continues his research on  hematopoietic and cellular control systems.  One study examines an  age-structured model for erythropoiesis, which is compared to a  simpler model with two delays.  Bifurcation analyses predict  oscillations that correlate reasonably well with studies on  auto-immune hemolytic rabbits.  Mathematical studies investigate  the key modeling elements that lead to oscillations observed in  some serious hematopoietic diseases.  Study of the erythropoietic  model extends to a related system for thrombopoiesis for which  more clinical problems have been observed.  This research improves  a current age-structured model so as to match better experimental  data following a phlebotomy, including the effects of plasma  regeneration, the accelerated maturing and active destruction in  the aging of erythrocytes.  Mathematical analyses examine the  significance of the state-dependent delays in the reduced  age-structured model and parameter sensitivity.  Research  continues in collaboration with Dr.  J.  W.  Zyskind on the modeling  of initiation of DNA replication in Escherichia coli.  Mathematical models are developed to support current theories on  the most important biochemical events beginning the DNA  replication cycle.  Interest centers on the role of the stable  protein DnaA, which experimentally has been shown to play a key  role.  The models consider the significance of an eclipse period  for DnaA mRNA synthesis following initiation, the existence of an  unknown protein recently discovered that inactivates DnaA, and  the competition for binding important activation sites with a  growth dependent protein, Fis.  Mathematical studies continue on  cellular control systems in exponentially growing cells and  extend to examine what happens when cells experience starvation.       Both proposed areas of study use mathematical models to  provide a better understanding of the fundamental controls in  important biological systems.  The f ear of contamination of the  blood supply by the HIV virus, which causes AIDS, results in many  surgical patients providing their own blood for the operation.  The mathematical models in this proposal allow the study of  optimal schemes for regeneration of red blood cells, which could  indicate ways for increasing this supply.  This leads to a lower  demand on the general blood supply and increased security of the  blood supply for the self-donors.  In addition, there are several  serious hematopoietic diseases (diseases linked to the formation  of different types of blood cells) that are poorly understood.  The proposed models provide a non-invasive means to examine which  aspects of this complicated biological control system are most  likely to result in the observed problems.  This gives clinicians  more information on possible therapeutic treatments and narrows  the search for the primary cause of the disease.  The mathematical  models for the initiation of DNA replication in bacteria again  provides a non-experimental approach to better understand an  important biological process.  In this case, the study examines  the control of the cell cycle in bacteria, which is fundamental  to cell growth and reproduction.  Biotechnology relies heavily on  the bacterium, E. coli, for many of its experiments and products,  so a better understanding of the cell cycle aids this industry as  well as providing some answers to basic questions in cell  biology.",
