Stochastic adaptive control is the control of an incompletely   known stochastic system.  Typically to solve an adaptive control problem it   is necessary to identify the unknown parameters of the system and   simultaneously to construct a control based on an ergodic cost functional.    The stochastic systems to be considered include finite dimensional, linear   and nonlinear systems and infinite dimensional systems that include both   linear and semilinear partial differential equations.  The control for the   partial differential equations can occur only on the boundary or at discrete   points.  Some specific systems include stochastic models in the mathematics   of finance and in stochastic manufacturing processes.  Since self-optimal   adaptive controls often cannot be determined or may not exist, the   construction of almost optimal adaptive controls will be continued.  An   important component of this study is the computational investigations in   adaptive control which includes the performance of estimation algorithms   and adaptive controls.    Many important physical systems are controlled.  Typically a system is not   completely known and often there are perturbations or errors that can be   naturally modeled by noise.  The control of an unknown system with noise   is called stochastic adaptive control.  This project will investigate some   stochastic adaptive control problems that have applications to some   important physical systems.  The investigation includes both theoretical and   computational aspects.",
