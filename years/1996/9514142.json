 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Sih  9514142    A blend of field surveys and experiments in semi-natural  conditions will be used to examine the ecological  determinants and selective consequences of mating behavior  in a system with male-female sexual conflict.  The focal  system studied is a semi-aquatic insect, the stream water  strider, Aquarius remigis.  This species shows very clear  male-female conflict:  males continually attempt to mate  with females, while females almost always resist male mating  attempts.  Previous experimental work showed that various  biotic, ecological factors (predation risk, food  availability, density, sex ratio) have major impacts on  mating patterns (mating activity, mating frequency, mating  duration, non-random mating by size) and that these effects  depend largely on the influence of these factors on patterns  of female resistance to male mating attempts (i.e., on  female behavior in the male-female conflict).                               The proposed studies expand on  current knowledge in three ways:    1.  This study will move us significantly closer to a full  understanding of how spatial and temporal variation in  ecological conditions (both biotic and abiotic) influence  both variation in mating dynamics and overall patterns of  sexual selection.    2.  This study will provide a rare instance of an  experimental test of predictions on variation in sexual  selection based on known behavioral mechanisms (in this  case, male-female conflict) and the effects of ecological  conditions on these behaviors.    3.  Studies of selection in nature will provide a bridge  between mechanistic experimental studies of behavior in semi-  natural conditions and effects of these behavioral  mechanisms in nature.    In sum, 1) patterns of sexual selection (as quantified by  modern statistical methods) will be explained  mechanistically by using information on behaviors (male-  female conflict) that underlie sexual selection, and 2) male  and female behavior a(and  thus patterns of sexual  selection), in turn, will be understood as flexible  responses to variation in both biotic and abiotic,  ecological conditions.  Overall, the integration of concepts  and information from three exciting fields (male-female  conflict, quantitative studies of sexual and natural  selection, and ecology of mating systems) should add  significant insights to our knowledge in all three fields  and thus add to our general understanding of reproductive  behavior.",
