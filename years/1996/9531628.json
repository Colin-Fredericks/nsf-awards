This is a renewal, with minor modifications, of the program  at the University of Pittsburgh for the past 4 years.  Besides their research activities, the participants will  also participate in academic studies in support of the  research work, and will help to serve as mentors and role  models for high school or less advanced college students.  The program emphasizes African-American participation, both  from within and outside the host institution, but all  interested students are invited to apply.  Students may  participate as early as the summer before their sophomore  year in college.  The program is for summer participation  (10 weeks) with participation in consecutive summers  strongly encouraged.  Some students may continue their  research during the school year.  ***",
