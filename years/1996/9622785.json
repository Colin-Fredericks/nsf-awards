The mathematical  problems address the general questions:  How  do nonlinear systems relax to equilibrium?  How do interfaces and defects  form and how do they propagate?  These questions arise both for diffuse and  sharp interface models.  We also encounter interesting questions in  phase interface dynamics which are closely tied to interesting questions in  geometry.  We intend to obtain information on the qualitative behavior of  phase states predicted by several new models  as well as classical modelsfor  phase transition.  We will consider isothermal  solid-solid transitions  which occur without a change in the total amount of each species and we will  also study liquid-solid transformations where a heat equation is coupled to  that for the order parameter. There are natural situations where the  perimeter or the geometry of the interface, does not change significantly  during the evolution.  Then a reduction to a finite dimensional dynamical  system is often possible.  A good deal of our effort in these investigations  is spent towards  identifying and  understanding the underlying finite  dimensional  dynamics.  %%%  We investigate  certain physical phenomena where surface  tension  plays a role. Surface tension is responsible for the shape of planets, as  well as for the shape of rain drops.  It is also  the reason why skating on  ice is possible. Generally it is a second order effect.  However when the  other forces balance each other, surface tension can  become the determining  factor.  Here is anexample:  In the first stages of the space program  scientists were puzzled by the fact that as soon as the rocket was exiting  the earth's gravitiational  attraction  the engines would shut off as if they were running out of fuel.  Eventually they realized that in space the fuel in the tank forms into  sphe rical shapes due to surface tension effects with many blobs staying away  from the walls of the container.  We are interested in phase change phenomena , for example those involving  ice and water (different phases of the same substance which can coexist near  the critical temperature of 32F).  Understanding the way certain phases mix  is important for determinig the properties of materials. Superconductivity  is a good example to which our work applies.  For  understanding all this, one, in principle, could start with  the basic  equations  of physics. The problem  with this approach is the enormous  complexity that one encounters  and the difficulty in the numerical  simulation. For dealing with this scientists are proposing  adhoc,  phenomenologically convincing models, which have the advantage of  great  simplicity.  Our work is of qualitative nature. It  aims to establish that  some of  these simple mathematical  models exhibit the wealth of behavior  making them capable of describing and predicting  the  phenomena that are  observed .  ***",
