 "awd_abstract_narration": "The impression that science is undergoing a new phase of  reorganization and retrenchment is widespread, and in response  there have been numerous appeals to a revived \"economics of  science.\"  Many commentators and analysts do not recognize that  there have been three different theoretical approaches to an  economics of science, dating from the 1930s, the 1950s, and a  Newer school which has only now been consolidating its position.  Thus, just as philosophers, science policy experts and scientists  themselves have been calling for a rationalization and  reorganization of science along economic principles, or else  criticizing economists for their imperialistic pretensions, there  has been very little consensus over what a theory of the  \"marketplace of ideas\" would entail.    The purpose of this conference is to bring together the major  representatives of each vintage of the economics of science,  along with science policy experts, sociologists and philosophers  of science, and some representative scientists concerned with  these issues, in order to come to some agreement as to what might  be useful in notions of competition, accountability and the  invisible hand when applied to the process of scientific inquiry.  One half of the conference will be devoted to theoretical issues,  such as the treatment of science as a public good, the  application of strategic game theory to the \"industrial  organization\" of science, and the relevant traditions of the  treatment of knowledge in economic theory and their bearing upon  the portrayal of science; while the other half will be concerned  with more applied policy issues, such as the impact of imposing  accountability upon the structure of science, evidence of the  decline of a Mertonian \"culture of credit\" in increasing  hierarchy and division of labor, and the economics of the  publication and dissemination of findings. The major aim of the  conference is to advance and consolidate the emerging field of  the economics of science by disseminating  and evaluating the  various approaches in a systematic and comprehensive manner.",
