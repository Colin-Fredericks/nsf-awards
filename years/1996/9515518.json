 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three-dimensional Reconstruction from Electron Micrographs of  Randomly Oriented Macromolecules.    Knowledge of the structure of macromolecules is essential to an  understanding of their functions in biological systems. Many  large macromolecules can only be analyzed by threedimensional  electron microscopy. For single asymmetrical particles, in  contrast to crystalline objects, resolutions achieved in three  dimensions have been limited to 2-3 nm. The techniques proposed  here will contribute to a fuller usage of information contained  in a micrograph and are an important step toward achieving higher  resolution and thus a better understanding of biological  function.    A method is proposed for three-dimensional reconstruction from  electron micrographs of randomly oriented single macromolecules.  Biological particles are radiation sensitive, and imaging must be  done under low-dose conditions. Only techniques that combine  information of many identical particles can overcome the limits  imposed by radiation sensitivity. One of the most successful  methods of this kind was SECReT (Single Exposure Conical  Reconstruction Technique), developed by the P.I.. Programs for  this method have been distributed to laboratories world wide and  have been used for the determination of more than 15 structures  over the last seven years. However, SECReT requires that all  particles used in a reconstruction have the same orientation  within the plane of the specimen. Deviations from this preferred  orientation limit the resolution in three dimensions. Proposed  here is a new method for determining the orientation of particles  from their projections. This technique can be used for refining  the orientation of projections used for SECReT and for the  determination of projection angles of particles with unknown  orientations. Successful development of this technique will lead  to substantial reduction in experimental effort and increase the  resolution achievable in three dimensions.    The theory of Radon t ransforms is the basis for three-dimensional  reconstruction algorithms. Most research has focused on the  design of efficient inversion algorithms and only a few  applications have made use of their potential as image processing  tools. In this proposal Radon transforms are used as tools for  simultaneous translational and rotational alignment of  projections in three dimensions. Once the orientations of the  projections are known a threedimensional reconstruction can be  calculated. The alignment/reconstruction method will be combined  with a Gibbs sampling technique for overcoming noise limitations  and for image classification. Programs to assess the feasibility  of the proposed technique have been written and first results  have been published.    The new technique will be applied to two objects, the calcium  release channel from sarcoplasmic reticulum and the 50S ribosomal  subunit from Escherichia coli. The two macromolecules were chosen  because they exhibit features that are advantageous for testing  the procedures, and because results at higher resolution will  contribute to a better understanding of their function. The  four-fold symmetry of the calcium release channel can be used to  increase the signal to noise ratio, whereas the 50S ribosomal  subunit is a globular structure with few protuberances and ideal  for testing the limits of the applicability of this method.",
