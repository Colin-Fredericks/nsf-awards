 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513962  Nelson    The  surfaces of a variety of marine sediments are dominated  by  colorless  sulfur bacteria of the genera  Thioploca  and  Beggiatoa.   Although few of these bacteria have been  grown  in  pure culture, the best characterized representatives can  multiply at the oxic-anoxic interface where there are  steep  gradients of hydrogen sulfide and oxygen, which can serve as  their oxidizable substrate and oxidant, respectively.  There  is   emerging   evidence  that  these  bacteria   are   also  autotrophs,  i.e.  they can synthesize their  cell  material  starting  with  carbon dioxide as their sole carbon  source.  In some environments with little or no available oxygen, the  dominant  representatives of these  bacteria  are  extremely  large  and  they  contain a membrane-bound central  vacuole,  comprising  roughly 80% of cell volume. These are  the  only  bacteria  for  which this structure has been  reported.   In  dense  samples  from  three different  locations,  vacuolate  Beggiatoa  and Thioploca were very recently demonstrated  to  contain nitrate in concentrations 10,000-fold higher than in  their  surrounding habitat.  This proposal  postulates  that  these  bacteria  use  this internal nitrate  as  a  terminal  electron acceptor facilitating their respiration of  soluble  sulfide  and/or organic compounds.  Proposed studies include  microelectrode  and chemical gradient analysis  of  in  situ  consumption rates of potential electron donors (sulfide  and  organics)  and  electron  acceptors  (nitrate  and  oxygen).  Assays of diagnostic enzymes and studies using radiolabelled  organic  and inorganic carbon compounds will help  elucidate  the  relative roles of these compounds in their  metabolism.  Studies  of  the  time-course  of  utilization  of  internal  nitrate  and  the resultant products, coupled  with  various  enzyme assays, will measure the capacity these bacteria have  for  denitrification.  Additionally, using pure cultures  in  spatially  structured cultu re media the  relative  rates  by  which  these bacteria use organic and inorganic  energy  and  carbon  sources  sill be assessed. Vacuolate  Beggiatoa  are  proposed  as  a  model  of  an important  link  between  the  vigorous sulfur cycle of eutrophic marine sediments and  the  nitrogen  cycle.   If  they  and  Thioploca  prove   to   be  denitrifiers,  they  will  be  the  first   example  of   an  ecologically dominant bacterium capable of removing combined  nitrogen from a marine ecosystem.",
