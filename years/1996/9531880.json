 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531880    Davis    In conjunction with a companion project by Dr. Brechner Owens of the Woods   Hole Oceanographic Institution, 150 profiling ALACE (Autonomous Lagrangian And   Circulation Explorer) floats will measure the absolute velocity and evolution   of the temperature and salinity structure of the upper 1500 m in the subpolar   gyre as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment (ACCE).    Absolute velocities will be mapped at nominal depths of 400 and 1500 meters'   depth using float arrays deployed uniformly over the basin.  The velocity data   will address three major pathways of the meridional overturning circulation   (MOC) within the subpolar gyre: the shallow inflow of water into the regions   of water mass modification; the convection that forms new dense waters; and   the outflow of the resultant intermediate water from this source region.    Temperature and salinity profiling will describe time evolution of the upper   1500 m, allowing quantification of the rates of water-mass modification in the   warm-water limb of the MOC that supplies water for formation of deep and   intermediate water.  With 150 profiles observed roughly every ten days over   two years, these observations will describe evolution with a combined temporal   and spatial resolution greater than can be provided by all the other ACCE   observations, especially over the winter-time convection season when other   observations are extremely scarce.    Analysis of these data will provide time series of three-dimensional maps of   the velocity, temperature, and salinity fields within the upper 1500 m of the   subpolar gyre over the duration of the ACCE field experiment.  Additionally,   statistical analyses will provide spatial distributions of mean circulation   and quantities like eddy kinetic and potential energies, eddy mixing, and   fluxes of heat and freshwater. These gyre-wide estimates will provide strong  constraints for the future climate models that must be developed to adequately  include the  physics of the subpolar gyre, particularly convection.  The   absolute velocity measurements will also be used to reference large-scale   geostrophic shears obtained from hydrography in this region where strong  barotropic components are common.",
