 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modular curves are moduli spaces for structures on elliptic  curves. Modular functions come from the homogeneous space  structure-through SL(2,R) action- on an affine subset of the  modular curve. This award provides funds for an investigation  that applies modular curve thinking to moduli spaces that have no  homogeneous space structure. The key definition is a Modular  Tower attached to the data coming from any finite group G and a  prime p dividing the order of G. The investigation will cover  applications to the following topics. (a) Invariants attached to  theta functions of specific types of curves. (b) Curves over  finite fields with special relations among their zeta function  zeros. (c) Structured conclusions on the inverse Galois  problem.  (d) A program for analyzing properties of the Grothendieck-  Teichmuller group using projective systems of real points on a  modular  tower. The objective is to show that modular towers  produce solutions to classical problems not previously benefiting  from analogs of modular functions. This award also supports an  investigation by postdoctoral student Y. Kopeliovich. Kopeliovich  will continue using theta functions with characteristic for  giving detailed degree bounds on maps from modular curves to the  sphere.  This research falls into the general mathematical field  of Number Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the  study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those  dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It  is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for  many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the  last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse   applications in areas such as data transmission and processing,  and  communication systems. This particular proposal has  applications to cryptography, through the classification and  production of polynomial functions, called exceptional,  specifically suited for encoding data.",
