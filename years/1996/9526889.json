The CRP will operate with an integrated science  plan in which all of the initial scientific characterization of  the cores will be done at McMurdo Station in the Antarctic during  two drilling seasons over two successive years.  The drilling  seasons will each be of two months duration and will operate in  much the same manner as two month cruises of the Ocean Drilling  Program.  The scientific activities associated with  characterization of the cores will include magnetostratigraphy,  biostratigraphy, petrography, mineralogy, and sedimentology.    Age determination is of principal importance in such a project  because a temporal framework is necessary to obtain a history of  climatic and tectonic events.  This award supports a program of  research which will enable determination of a high-quality  paleomagnetic stratigraphy, with the appropriate mineral magnetic  studies, in support of the CRP.    For the on-site magnetic studies this award will: undertake  logging of the whole-core magnetic susceptibility which will  assist in correlation of the several overlapping cores to be  recovered during the CRP; determine a magnetostratigraphic  framework for dating of the cores; undertake mineral magnetic and  environmental magnetic studies to assess the reliability of the  paleomagnetic signal; and determine if environmental magnetic  properties yield information concerning changes in the tectonic,  sedimentologic, diagenetic or climatic influences on the  sedimentary record at Cape Roberts.  Detailed environmental and  mineral magnetic studies will also enable evaluation of the  sediments as recorders of the geomagnetic field.  The Cape  Roberts records provide the potential to obtain rare high  southern latitude constraints on geomagne tic field behavior.  Paleomagnetic studies should also provide important data  concerning crustal movements and rift development in the Ross Sea  sector.",
