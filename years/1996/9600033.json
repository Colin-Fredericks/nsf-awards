 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Billie Spencer of Notre Dame  University and two faculty members and a graduate student  from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to  collaborate in computational engineering with Professors  G.I. Schueller and H.J. Pradlwarter of the Institute for  Mechanics of the University of Innsbruck, Austria.  Their  goal is to improve the calculation of failure probabilities  of certain categories of dynamical systems. They propose to  approach this by developing the concept of continuously  evolving sample distributions based upon satisfaction of  certain `fitness` criteria.  The key feature of their  approach is investigating the use of Monte Carlo simulation  methods, and enhancing them through `genetic algorithms.`  This approach shows great promise for enhanced computational  efficiency and applications to larger and more complex  systems.  The research effort will benefit from the complementary  expertise of the two groups.  The US group will focus on  development of the genetic algorithm and parallelization of  the Monte Carlo procedures, areas in which the US  investigators are well qualified.  The Austrian group will  concentrate their efforts on the development of advanced  Monte Carlo procedures, including the determination of  proper fitness functions.",
