 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, an increasing amount of research has been devoted to examining the  importance of mate choice by females in primate sexual relationships.  However, our  understanding of female mate choice is limited due to the difficulty of teasing apart effects of  female choice from effects of male behavior which may influence female mate choice.  For  example, evidence from numerous nonhuman primate species suggests that females are  constrained in expressing their mating preferences due to male strategies that involve aggressive  exclusion of rivals and sexual coercion of females.  Because female mate choice will often be  constrained by male tactics, it is difficult to ascertain whether a particular act represents the  female's preference, or a compromise between her interests and those of males.  This research will involve an experimental study on captive savanna baboons in order to  investigate female mating preferences in the absence of male opportunities to coerce females or  exclude rival males.  This will be accomplished by comparing male-female interactions in a  naturalistic outdoor group setting and an experimental condition in which females are given an  opportunity to associate and mate with a choice of males in the absence of male tactics.  If  females' choices of mates are constrained significantly by male behavior, they should associate  and mate with different males and/or a greater number of males under experimental conditions  than naturalistic group conditions.  The proposed research is one of the first attempts to examine  nonhuman primate female mate choice experimentally and the first study in a nonhuman primate  to investigate the extent to which male mating tactics constrain female mate choice.  This experimental paradigm also provides a unique opportunity for validating female preference  signals.  By comparing females' behavior in the outdoor group setting with their behavior during  experimental mate-choice trials, the researchers will determine whether any behaviors exhibited  by estrous females in the naturalistic group setting are reliable indicators of female mating  preferences for particular males (i.e. female preference signals).",
