 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary visual cortex of the brain, also known as area V1, is the first major cortical target for the nerve fibers in the visual pathway.  It has been considered classically to function mainly for analyzing features in the visual world considered to be \"local\" characteristics of pieces of objects, such as spatial orientations and locally contrasting parts of objects.  We now know that it also is involved in much more complex perceptual tasks such as completion of contours around whole objects, for context-dependent perception of visual attributes, and for some of the experience-dependent changes in perceptual performance.  Some of these properties are mediated by recently discovered long-range lateral connections of single cells within V1.  This project utilizes new methods of optical imaging of neural activity, along with physiology, pharmacology and anatomy, to study responses to visual stimuli containing multiple local elements that form more \"global\" visual features.  Functional properties of these horizontal interactions intrinsic to V1 are compared to the contributions of feedback connections to and from higher order cortical areas, particularly examining the relative roles of facilitation and inhibition.     Results from this work will lead to a better understanding of the early stages of visual processing in visual cortex, and also be relevant to understanding how cortical architecture relates to cortical function in general, which remains a fundamental issue in understanding the brain itself.",
