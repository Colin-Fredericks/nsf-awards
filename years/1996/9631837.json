 "awd_abstract_narration": "High school girls who have completed their junior year will spend  eight weeks during the summer on the Iowa State University (ISU)  campus where they will research programming methods and develop  biological and physical science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM)  units for the Internet.  These units will be designed to get middle  school girls to explore careers in those areas.  The summer  research interns will be directed by a team of four female graduate  students who have demonstrated ability in computers, are trained in  courseware development, and are in SEM-related fields.  A fifth  female graduate student in secondary education will work as  consultant to the team to provide expertise in curricular content,  educational delivery, and impact on the targeted middle school  students.    Although the graduate women's experiences also will enhance their  professional development, the primary goal of increasing girls'  participation in SEM will be accomplished through the following:  developing computer Internet explorations packages that will  attract middle school girls to SEM; training high school girls in  the use of computer technology to design and develop the  explorations package, which will be the focus of their summer  research internship on the ISU campus; using ISU graduate women in  SEM to supervise the explorations package development process on a  daily basis, adding a special dimension to their graduate school  experience; working with experts in middle school education to  achieve the desired impact; disseminating the developed packages  through the Internet; publicizing these readily available, no-cost  resource packages to statewide education agencies through  announcements in education journals, at educator conferences, and  at career exploration events for middle school girls and community  groups like the Girl Scouts and 4-H; and advertising the project  and its product nationwide through notes to education-oriented  newsgroups and through reports at conferences on edu cation,  computers, and gender issues.",
