In order to utilize this technique effectively, and to control the process, a fundamental knowledge of combustion synthesis mechanisms involving the evolution of non-equilibrium initial products toward the final product is of critical importance.  The two major objectives of the proposed work are: (1) the analysis of the initial product structure formation, and (2) the measurement of the effective and detailed kinetics of the formation of intermetallics in a combustion regime.  The approach involves obtaining a clear understanding of the evolution of product structure from when the product first appears to when the final product is formed by the post combustion processes.  Four basic initial product formation mechanisms are presented for gasless combustion synthesis.  By varying the experimental conditions such as green density, particle size, initial temperature, cooling rate, etc., and from the initial product structure, the PI hopes to determine the appropriate conditions for each of the formation mechanisms.  A variety of experimental techniques will be used in the proposed research.  These include combustion wave quenching, modified particle-foil technique, time resolved X-ray diffraction (TRXRD), new method of microscopic high speed video recording and a novel experimental apparatus for monitoring the kinetics of admixed gas evolution and ionization in the reaction zone.",
