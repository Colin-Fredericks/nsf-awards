The proposed work involves study of  various aspects of quantum hall effect.  These include spin  textures (skyrmions) in quantum Hall effect and other itinerant  ferromagnets and an analysis of symmetries and dissipation near  quantum critical points.  The latter has been stimulated by the  observation of symmetries of the nonlinear response in quantum  Hall experiments.  Finally, there are plans to provide  theoretical support to local experimental groups studying quantum  Hall effect in 2-d electron gases and also in quasi 2-d Bechgaard  salts.   %%%  Last decade has seen an explosion of activity in quantum Hall  effect, a novel state of electrons in very high magnetic fields.  In spite of certain superficial similarities to a superconductor,  another anomalous state for electrons, this state is  fundamentally different.  The PI, a beginning assistant professor  at Princeton, has been a pioneer in the theory of this field, in  introducing some novel magnetic defects and related phenomena for  dissipation.  He will further advance this work.  He is also  proposing a theory-experimental collaboration with his colleagues  at Princeton to explore new opportunities.  ***",
