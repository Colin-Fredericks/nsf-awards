 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Black Forest Consortium, a group of fifteen New Yorkarea  academic institutions,seeks funds to construct a modern  research and training facility at its Field Station, the  1500-hectare (3750-acre) Black Rock Forest.  Black Rock  Forest is located in the Hudson Highlands,80 km (50 miles)  north of New York City, and possesses a wide variety of  terrestrial and aquatic habitats for study.  It has been  carefully protected and managed for nearly a century, and  has been utilized by the Black Rock Forest Consortium since  1989.  The Forest has become a focal point for scientific  field studies and education for thousands of faculty and  students from Consortium institutions.    Despite many natural features that makes it a logical  location for scientific field work, the Black  Rock Forest lacks suitable research and training facilities.  An imminent increase in scientific activity is expected due  to the creation of a new BRF Consortium member, the Center  for Environmental Research and Conservation (CERC) at  Columbia University.  The CERC initiative will be enhanced  by the creation of seven new faculty and three new  postdoctoral positions in biology, ecology, and other  conservation-related fields.  A major component of CERC will  be increased scientific focus on the Black Rock Forest and  intensive field training.    The Consortium has designed a new, integrated headquarters  structure to b e constructed at the Forest in three phases.  Phase I, the focus of this proposal, will contain research  labs, student lab/classrooms, administrative offices, and a  data control center at the hub of an extensive environmental  monitoring network.  It is expected that this facility will  become a intensively used for scientific research and  training.",
