 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this research are to design fast, precise parts  feeders  and  to improve nonprehensile robotic manipulation.  The  two goals are closely related.  A good architecture for  a   parts  feeder  exploits  both  parallelism  and  dynamic  contact,  by  pipelining fast-acting low-degree  of  freedom  manipulators  along the feeder.  Nonprehensile  manipulation  of  objects  by  humans  or animals often  involves  dynamic  contact  in  which the object undergoes a series of  partial  grasps,  shuffled  back and forth between various  contacts.  The  key  to  fast  nonprehensilemanipulation  of  parts  is  controlling  part  motions through moving  and  accelerating  contacts.  This research builds a set of analysis tools that  describe how the motions of accelerating constraints  affect  the  effective  forces felt by the parts being  manipulated.  These analyses take careful account of contact and friction,  plus any forces already acting on the part, such as gravity.  The  resulting tools will allow a planner to produce control  algorithms  for the feeder, and thus dynamically reconfigure  the  feeder  as  part shapes change or  errors  appear.   In  traditional feeder design, much of the mechanics of the task  has been compiled into hardware, in the form of fixed feeder  gates  and orienting shapes.  At the other extreme,  general  purpose  robots  have suffered from too much generality  and  too  little  reliable  software.  An important  intermediate  architecture  consists of a sequence of simple  manipulators  under  software control.  This research will explore feeders  using  the   palm  manipulation  paradigm.   As  parts  pass  through  a  feeder,  a  sequence of  low-degree  of  freedom  devices  will  orient the parts using nonprehensile  dynamic  contacts.   Since  the configurations  and  motions  of  the  devices are under software control and since the devices are  easy  to program by virtue of having low degrees of freedom,  the  feeder  should be able to accomodate  las t-minute  part  changes with relative ease.",
