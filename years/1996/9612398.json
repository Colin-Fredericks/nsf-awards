His  accomplishments include:      I.   Significant impact on minority student college and university       education through his work on NIH funded projects -- over 180       students mentored by him through these programs or his role as       a faculty participant in other department projects such as the       NSF Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) and       Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Programs;      II.  Significant institutional impact -- the American Chemical       Society (ACS), in great part through his effort, established       the Committee on Minority Affairs in 1993 with Gutierrez       serving as its first chair, which in turn established the ACS       Minority Scholars Program, a $5 million scholarship program       for undergraduates; and the establishment of the ACS Award for       Encouraging Disadvantaged Students to Pursue Careers in       Chemical Sciences.    -- as Vice Chair of the National Academy of Science Committee on    a National Scholars Program, under contract to NASA, he has    articulated persuasively the responsibility of all faculty, but    especially science faculty, to seek out talented minority    students and encourage their academic development very early in    their undergraduate career; and      III. Beyond individual students, Gutierrez has effected an entire       cohort of future science professionals.",
