Mariano, Department of Chemistry, University of Maryland at College Park, to pursue  with Professor Ung Chan Yoon, Department of Chemistry, Pusan National University, Korea, for 36 months, a program of cooperative  research in the area of electron transfer photochemistry.  The four thrusts of this project are to (1) probe important scientific questions  regarding the mechanisms and synthetic applications of organic photochemical reactions which are promoted by excited state electron  transfer, (2) bring an international cooperative perspective to an ongoing research project supported by the Chemistry Division, National  Science Foundation (NSF), (3) develop strong scientific interactions between scientists at the University of Maryland and their counterparts  at Korean institutions, and (4) provide an introduction of young American scientists to unique research opportunities as part of their doctoral  dissertation research.    It is well recognized that electron transfer (SET) photochemistry is a key mechanistic event in a wide variety of ground and excited state  chemical and biochemical processes.  Organic photochemistry is one discipline where this recognition has profoundly impacted the  understanding of mechanistic pathways and the development of new reactions.  The PI and his Korean collaborator have made a number of  significant contributions in the field of SET-photochemistry and are highly respected researchers in the field of the proposal.  This project is  relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and  Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on  problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).   This project adds an international coopera tive dimension to the PI's ongoing research under NSF Grant No. CHE-9420889  ***",
