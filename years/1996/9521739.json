 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521739  Long      The goal of this project is to learn how to produce  practical magnets based on R2Fel7 materials by adding a  combination of substitutional and interstitial elements. The  proposed work involves both synthesis and characterization  studies using magnetic, neutron diffraction, and Mossbauer  spectroscopies. Samples will be prepared by arc or induction  melting, followed by annealing. Magnetic measurements will  be used to determine the bulk magnetic properties of the  resulting materials. Rietveld refinement of neutron  diffraction data will be used to determine the crystallo-  graphic and magnetic properties of the materials, including  site occupancies of the substitutional and interstitial  elements and the magnetic moments at each magnetic atom  site. Mossbauer spectral analysis will be used to obtain  detailed microscopic information about the magnetic  properties and local electronic environment at each iron  site. A Wigner-Seitz cell analysis of each crystallographic  site will be used to determine the relationship between the  site's microscopic crystallographic and magnetic properties  and the corresponding bulk properties of the magnets.  %%%  The discovery in the early 1980's of the rare earth-iron-  boron magnets revolutionized the permanent magnet industry.  These materials offered a significant improvement in  magnetic properties over the previous best permanent  magnetic materials, at about half the cost in terms of  energy stored per unit mass of material. However, the Curie  temperature of the rare earth-iron-boron magnets is less  than 60% of the Curie temperature of the previous best  permanent magnets. Substitutional additions unfortunately  did not substantially increase the highest Curie temperature  of the compounds and their practical utility. The goal of  this project is to learn how to make practical magnets based  on R2Fel7 materials by the addition of a combination of  substitutional and interstitial elements. The right combina-  tion of elements sho uld greatly improve the thermomagnetic  properties of such materials.  ***",
