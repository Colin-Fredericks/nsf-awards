 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting   Professor  Hammes-Schiffer at the University of Notre Dame as part of the CAREER   program for young scientists. The objective of this research is to   develop and apply new methods for simulating dynamical processes   involving multiple proton transfer reactions.   In order to simulate   proton transfer reactions, methods that incorporate the quantum   mechanical behavior of the hydrogen atoms being transferred must be   developed.   In surface-hopping methods such as molecular dynamics with   quantum transitions (MDQT), trajectories split into branches that are   each assigned to a particular proton quantum state, so branching   processes (i.e. processes involving multiple channels or pathways) are   described accurately.  The direct extension of MDQT to processes   involving multiple proton transfer steps, however, is not computationally   feasible.  The proposed new method, MC-MDQT, combines MDQT with a   multiconfigurational (MC)  self-consistent-field approach and will describe branching processes   properly as  well as allow the quantum mechanical treatment of multiple hydrogen   atoms.  This method will be applied to two classes of systems.   The first is   proton transport along linear chains of hydrogen-bonded water molecules.     This is an important process because the rapid transport of protons over   large distances in biologically important systems such as   bacteriorhodopsin and photosynthetic reaction centers is thought to occur   along such chains.   The second class of  systems that will be studied is   hydrogen transfer in enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenase, which plays a   vital role in glycolysis.   Kinetic isotope effect experiments indicate   that hydrogen tunneling is significant in a variety of enzyme reactions.    The goal of these applications is to elucidate the underlying physical   principles of proton transfer reactions and to clarify the detailed   mechanisms of these biologically important reactions.  The educational   objectives of this Carreer grant are to promote the wider use of computer   simulations in the areas of organic chemistry and biochemistry.  A course   in computer simulations has already been designed.  An outgrowth of this   project is the creation of a computer lab workbook, as well as a textbook   which will facilitate the development of such courses at other   universities.   A general proton transfer reaction involves the passing of a hydrogen   atom nucleus from a donor to an acceptor.  Experiments have shown that   the hydrogen atom can tunnel through an energy barrier required for such   a reaction.  This research will focus on methods that incorporate quantum   mechanical behavior, such as tunneling in order to simulate proton   transfer reactions.  The educational objectives of this Carreer grant are   to promote the wider use of computer simulations in the areas of organic   chemistry and biochemistry.  A course in computer simulations has already   been designed.   The course consists of three parts: The lectures convey   the fundamental concepts for computer simulation;  Computer labs provide   hands on experience with molecular modeling, while independent research   motivates sutdents to pursue future projects.   An outgrowth of this   project is the creation of a computer lab workbook, as well as a textbook   which will facilitate the development of such courses at other   universities.",
