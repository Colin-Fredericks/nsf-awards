With the advent of the  theory of operator spaces, also known as \"quantized functional analysis\",  general, not-necessarily-self-adjoint, operator algebras have achieved an  ontological status comparable to that held by the self-adjoint operator  algebras.  Although the non-self-adjoint theory is not yet as well developed,  from certain perspectives, the explosion of results that has taken place in  the last six years, or so, deserves to be exposed in a fashion that will  allow the uninitiated, particularly younger scholars, easy access to the  basics of the subject from the current perspective.  The objective of the  conference is to provide a series of short courses, that will be published,  designed to provide an overview of the theory of non-self-adjoint operator  algebras and its relation to other areas of operator algebra and modern  analysis.  The themes to be stressed are: non-self-adjoint operator  algebras, general theory; concrete operator algebras, particularly reflexive  algebras; multivariable operator theory and representations of function  algebras; metric variations on themes from algebra - Hilbert and operator  modules; operator spaces and their applications to Banach space theory and  harmonic analysis; operator algebraic approaches to quantum groups;  non-self-adjoint operator algebras and wavelets.     The theory of non-self-adjoint operator algebras plays a central role in the  mathematical underpinnings of a lot of mathematics applied to areas of  national need.  For example, in the area of signal processing, which is used  to transmit data and images involved in all fields of science - from space  observatories to tomographs of the brain - fundamental constructs, such as  the so-calle d Toeplitz matrices and wavelet transforms, obtain their deepest  significance and are most clearly revealed when viewed from the perspective  of operator algebra.  Operator algebra lays bare their basic algebraic  properties (how they are manipulated in practice) and metric properties as  well (how they are measured).  In oil exploration, which involves wavelets  and signal processing in a somewhat different fashion, operator algebraic  methods, known as commutant lifting play a fundamental role.  Also, in  control theory, particularly in the design of aircraft and noise abaters,  the mathematics involved is to a large extent operator algebra.  The  breakthrough that took place about six years ago, and alluded to above,  enables the practitioner of this field to bring to bare effectively the full  power of modern algebra to tackle the most basic and  fundamental structural  questions.  The advances in this field have been very exciting and more are  to come.  But it is time collect a summary of what is known, including  bibliographies, so that new people can enter this exciting, emerging field  of research.",
