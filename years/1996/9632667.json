The devices include membrane and electrocatalytic  reactors, solid oxide fuel cells, and chemical sensors.  The  devices promise major advances in industrial chemical processes  by improving product selectivity, process efficiency and  environmental compatibility.  Special emphasis is on complex  oxides that are active catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation and  oxygen reduction and have the high ionic conductivity and  electronic conductivity required for ionic devices.  The MRSEC  supports the development, operation and maintenance of shared  experimental facilities for materials research.  It provides seed  funding for exploratory research, fosters research participation  by undergraduates and pre-college students, and is developing  strong industrial relationships.  The Center currently  supports  11 senior investigators, 3 postdoctoral research associates, 10  graduate students, and 6 undergraduates. The MRSEC is directed by  Professor Paul C.W. Chu.  %%%  Changing needs in transportation fuels, increasing availability  of natural gas, and the emphasis on energy efficient,  environmentally benign processes are driving new demands for  advanced catalytic and ceramic materials.  These trends suggest  new opportunities for improved catalytic and separation processes  that apply novel oxide materials in new energy production  approaches.
