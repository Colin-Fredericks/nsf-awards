During this visit, Dr.  Kosakowsky, with the collaboration of  Dr. Francisco Estrada  Belli, director of the Santa Rosa Archeological Project,  will examine surface collections of ceramics from the region  in order to provide maximum information on the local ceramic  chronology.  The analysis of ceramics is a critical step in  the identification of chronological placement of  archaeological sites, and of regional and inter-regional  patterns of interaction.  The examination of the available  material  will  provide a realistic background for selecting  sites for excavation in the coming season.    The archeological sequence of the Santa Rosa area has been  poorly documented up to now, but there are indications that  this region played a key role in networks of trade and  communication from as far away as Central Mexico, El  Salvador , the Guatemalan highlands, and the Maya lowlands.  Since the region is undergoing extensive modernization and  agricultural intensification, it is rapidly facing the loss  of archaeological resources.  It is critical that this type  of study be undertaken as soon as possible.  ***",
