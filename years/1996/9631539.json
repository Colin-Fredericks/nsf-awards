 "awd_abstract_narration": "Databases for spatial graph management are very important for a large number of applications including transportation, utilities (e.g. gas, electricity) and urban management. This project addresses the needs of spatial graph management in the areas of physical database design and query processing. The main objective is to develop, evaluate and implement a novel spatial graph storage and access method, called Connectivity-Clustered Access Method (CCAM), based on graph-connectivity.  CCAM assigns the nodes of a graphs to disk pages via the graph partitioning approach to maximize the Connectivity Residue Ratio, i.e., the chances that a pair of connected nodes are allocated to a common page of the file.  Another objective is to develop scalable spatial graph-clustering algorithms as well as incremental reorganization strategies to enhance CCAM.  This project also explores strategies to enhance existing geometric access methods for managing connectivity properties along with proximity properties. The techniques developed in the project are evaluated with benchmark graphs from Advanced Traveler Information System applications",
