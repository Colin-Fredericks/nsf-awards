 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Boshernitzan    The central subject in this proposal is  diophantine properties of iet's (interval exchange transformations).  Boshernitan's approach in the study of iet's,  contrary to the 'global' approaches  of others (H.Masur,  W.Veech  etc.),  makes special emphasis on the way   diophantine and algebraic properties of the parameters involved may affect the dynamical properties of an iet. Many results in  analytical number theory are extendable to iet's.  For example, Boshernitzan's recent result, joint with  C.Carroll,  that minimal iet's over a quadratic field must be pseudo-Anosof  (self-similar)  can be viewed as an extension of the classical  Lagrange's result on the periodicity of the continued  fraction representations of quadratic irrationals.  Perhaps the most outstanding conjecture in this direction  is  obtained from an  attempt to extend  to iet's  the famous Roth's theorem on the rate algebraic irrationals can be approximated  by the  rationals. (The analogue of the corresponding  Liouville's theorem is true.)  One of the tools at  Boshernitzan's disposal in tackling the above problems is his recent discovery of a connection between the rate of recurrence of  typical orbits in dynamical systems and the Hausdorff dimension of the   space  (quantitative version of  Poincare recurrence theorem).  For iet's, this connection works both directions. The same is true in many other situations  (Y.Peres, D.Ornstein, B.Weiss). The list of other Boshernitzan's interests includes number theory, billiards in polygons, ergodic theorems along subsequences of integers, Hardy fields  (joint   projects  with  M.Wierdl, D.Berend, G.Kolesnik, I.Kornfeld and  V.Bergelson).    Because of the basic nature of the present research proposal,  it is hard at this point to assess accurately the fields of possible applications.  Among the subject which may benefit from our research I  would only mention the possibility  of creation of new code   compression schemes useful  in computer technology   ( related to our discovery of quantitative version of Poincare recurrence  theorem)  and  possible applications to laser technology  (research  with  I. Kornfeld  on interval translation maps).",
