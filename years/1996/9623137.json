 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623137  E  The proposed work is the initial phase of  PI'slong term project   on ``Complex Materials and Complex Fluids''. The plan is to  explore and    develop ideas from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, advanced  numerical   techniques, asymptotics and rigorous mathematical analysis for  prototypical   problems, to reach a solid, coherent and practical level of  understanding   for the dynamical issues in polymeric liquids, high temperature   superconductors, etc. PI's work will be carried out in close  collaboration  with chemists and experimental physicists. In this initial phase,  PI proposes to study the following problems. (1). Dynamics and  morphology   of phase separation involving polymers. The emphasis is on   understanding the interplay between isotropic molecular  interaction  which drives the phase separation, and the anisotropic molecular  interaction which gives rise to orientational order, as well as  phase separation driven by polymerization. (2). Geometric defects  of  smectic liquid crystals. (3). Efficient and accurate numerical  methods for   complex flows.This includes direct simulation of high Reynolds  number   turbulent flows, turbulence models and polymeric liquids such as  liquid  crystals. The emphasis will be on reliable, practical and  parallelizable   methods which can be used immediately to enhance progress on  other fronts.  %%%  Many areas of technology calls for the manufacturing of  microcellular  foams and composite materials out of polymer solutions. The most  promising   candidate for the next generation of flat panel display devices  are made by  chemically driven phase separation processes in a liquid  crystal-prepolymer   solution. While a vast amount of experimental results have been  accumulated,  both for flexible and rigid polymers, the dynamics of these  processes  and the implication to morphology is very poorly understood.  Theoretical   understanding is hindered by the extreme complexity of these  problems. The   current proposal is a coordinat ed effort between applied  mathematicians,   chemists and physists to tackle this problem. A key component of  this   proposal is the numerical simulation of these processes using   state-of-the-art numerical methods and computers. The fact that  polymers are often large and non-uniform in their sizes makes  this problem  fundamentally different from the phase separation of ordinary  binary  liquids.  ***",
