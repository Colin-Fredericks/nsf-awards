 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the project is to identify sets of core competencies and skills in mathematics, science, engineering and technology that are required by industries that hire two-year college graduates with technical degrees.  the project will investigate 5 technology based industries, interview technicians and supervisors in five companies in each of these industries, and also interview a sample of graduates of community colleges.  the project will produce research papers on the measurement of the integration of community college curriculum with industrial needs and will provide a basis for future study of technical education.  It will provide some of the first detailed workplace ethnography's of the use of mathematics and science in industrial jobs of technicians.  No other study of colleges  has developed a similar curriculum study of community colleges and a match with industrial uses of those graduates.",
