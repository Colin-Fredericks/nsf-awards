 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634052  Huntley         This research project is part of the US Joint Global  Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at  (1) a better understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both  organic and inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2)  identifying the physical, ecological and biogeochemical  factors and processes which regulate the magnitude and  variability of these fluxes, and (3) placing these fluxes  into the context of the contemporary global carbon cycle.       The work is one of forty-four projects that are  collaborating in the Southern Ocean Experiment, a three-year  effort south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone to track  the flow of carbon through its organic and inorganic  pathways from the air-ocean interface through the entire  water column into the bottom sediment.   The experiment will  make use of the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer and the R/V  Thompson.       This specific project is a seasonal study of the  mesoscale spatial distribution of the carbon utilization by  zooplankton in the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone and the Ross  Sea.  There is strong evidence to indicate that the egestion  of pellets by zooplankton can contribute significantly to a  highly variable and episodic biogenic carbon flux in the  Southern Ocean.  The research approach used will quantify  the rate of total fecal production by the meso- and  macrozooplankton community at scales that dominate the  variability -- eddy-resolving spatial scales and seasonal  time scales -- in both the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone and  the Ross Sea study regions.  The process of quantification  will depend upon measurements of zooplankton abundance and  distribution using a SeaSoar-mounted Optical Plankton  Counter (OPC) in the Polar Frontal Zone, a net-mounted OPC  in the Ross Sea study area, and underway acoustic current  measurements in both regions.  Experimental measurements of  ingestion rate will be directed at developing empirical  relationships to body weight, food availability, and diel  periodicity for the p rincipal species of Antarctic  zooplankton grazers.  These relationships will then be  combined with measurements of biomass and distribution to  compute the rate of total fecal production.       The approach addresses those factors that are most  likely to give rise to the greatest variability in  zooplankton-produced biogenic flux:  (1) variability in  zooplankton biomass, and the food available to that biomass,  on scales of ten kilometers in the horizontal and ten meters  in the vertical, (2) seasonal variability, and (3)    variability that is attributable to the size-frequency  distribution of the zooplankton themselves.  The results  will quantify the role of zooplankton in carbon flux  processes of the Southern Ocean, leading to a better  understanding of the Southern Ocean carbon cycle.  ***",
