 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because solutions of ever-greater complexity of the vacuum  and electrovac Einstein equations, generated using  procedures based upon general formalisms of Belinskii-  Zakharov, Hoenselaers-Kinnersley-Xanthopoulos, Alekseev,  Sibgatullin, and Hauser-Ernst, are rarely checked by direct  substitution into the Einstein equations, it has become  especially important to validate the theoretical basis for  and to identify any limitations of such formalisms.  Dr. Ernst and Dr. Hauser will clarify the logical  foundations of solution-generating machinery by establishing  the mathematical relationships among the various formalisms,  and by attempting to provide, within an integrated  framework, clear statements and bona-fide proofs of all the  tacit or as yet unproven assumptions upon which the diverse  formalisms must ultimately be based.  This includes, but is  not limited to, a careful specification of domains of  functions and differentiability requirements, proofs of  equivalence of various integral equations and associated  Riemann-Hilbert problems, proofs of existence of solutions  of these equations, and proofs that these solutions satisfy  the Einstein equations.",
