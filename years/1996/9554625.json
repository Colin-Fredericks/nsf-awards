 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the ultimate goal of improving elementary teachers' concept  understanding of physical science and their physical science  teaching skills, the objective of this proposed project is:  To  encourage and enable colleges and universities to provide physical  science courses which are more appropriate to the entry-level  background of students, which better honor the learning process,  and which are more attuned to the exit-level needs of future  elementary school science teachers.  To accomplish this stated  objective, the AAPT proposes to provide a carefully orchestrated  program of awareness and training sessions and follow-up support  activities for physics and physical science faculty using Powerful  Ideas in Physical Science:  A Model Course (NSF#TPE-9154024) which  is based on well-documented research findings about science  learning.  It features a hands-on constructivist approach,  represents a \"less is more\" philosophy, includes content selected  specifically for the needs of future primary teachers, and uses  both traditional and alternative assessments.  The model represents  the cumulative efforts of a group of physics, chemistry and science  education faculty representing twelve different colleges and  universities.  It has been intentionally designed to be  transportable to a variety of institutions.  This proposal requests  funding for a three-year program to train and support physical  science faculty from colleges and universities across the nation to  use the model to reform their physical science courses for  prospective elementary teachers. Three levels of disseminatimn are  proposed:  1) Awareness Workshops, 2) Professional Development  Seminars, and 3) Summer Faculty Enhancement Programs.  Technical  assistance visits to participants' institutions will help assure  the quality of reform efforts.  Continuing follow-up support for  program participants will be provided through an electronic  bulletin board, articles and information in AAPT publications, and  special session s at meetings of the AAPT.",
