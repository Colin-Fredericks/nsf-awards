 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central goal of this project is the development of advanced  time-resolved FTIR instrumentation which will allow for the first time  the investigation of a wide variety of biological systems at the  sub-nanosecond to millisecond range. The proposed instrument will  incorporate novel features which will address the major short-comings  of current time-resolved FTIR instruments. The project will be  supported by the newly formed Center for Photonics Research at Boston  University and Bruker Instruments, Inc., a leader in time-resolved FTIR  instrumentation    In recent years it has been demonstrated that Fourier transform  infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy can provide detailed  information about dynamic changes in the protonation state, local  environment and orientation of specific amino acid residues in  proteins. This ability is enhanced by the recent development of  powerful new methods for band assignments by the introduction of  site-directed isotope labels (SDIL) into proteins. However, the current  generation of FTIR instruments have fallen short of their promise for  probing rapid conformational changes in biomolecular systems. Existing  limitations are related to the lack of sufficiently powerful broad-band  infrared sources, the relatively slow cycle-time or irreversible  response of most biological systems upon activation, the prevalence of  biological systems activated by mechanisms other than light, and the  need to simultaneously monitor changes in the infrared and UV-visible  absorption of a sample.    We propose to develop a unique step-scan FTIR system with the ability  to record simultaneous sub-nanosecond to millisecond infrared and  W-visible absorption changes in biomolecular systems. The instrument  will be based on recent breakthroughs in technology for ultra-high  intensity broad-band continuous (CW) and pulsed IR sources, rapid  sub-nanosecond transient recorders and infrared detectors and step-scan  interferometers. The development of a novel synchronized sampl e step  translator (SSST) will make it possible to shorten dramatically  measurement times and open the door to the investigation of dynamic  processes in a wide variety of biomolecular systems under physiological  conditions, including systems not activated by light, systems with very  slow cycle times and systems with irreversible processes. By combining  this proposed FTIR instrumentation with the recently developed method  of SDIL and site-directed non-native amino acid replacement (SNAAR),  breakthroughs are expected in the fields of protein folding, enzyme  mechanism, ion transport and signal reception. Transfer of the  developed technology for future commercial use will be facilitated by  the close interaction during the project with Bruker Instruments and  through the Center for Photonics Research             This request is for funds to purchase a Molecular Dynamics  PhosphorImager for use in research and teaching in molecular biology.  This instrument will be critical for research applications of at least  eight faculty as well as in training undergraduate and graduate  students in molecular biology.      Autoradiography using storage  phosphor technology offers several advantages over traditional  detection methods. Quantitation of amounts of radioactive protein or  DNA on gels or filters has traditionally been done using X-ray film and  densitometry or using scintillation counters. Storage phosphors are up  to 100 times more sensitive than X-ray film, enabling measurements well  below levels of detection for film. Also, screens are quantitatively  accurate over five orders of magnitude as compared to X-ray film which  has a linear range over only two orders of magnitude. The new  technology is also environmentally advantageous because it eliminates  the heavy metal waste disposal problems associated with film  processing, and when it replaces scintillation counting it reduces  mixed organic and radiochemical waste disposal problems. This  technology will enable new experimental appro aches, improve  quantitation, enhance productivity, and it will afford our students  state of the art training.           Significant advances in digital imaging technology provide  capabilities not otherwise available. The overall objective of this  proposal is to obtain a 16-bit/pixel digital imager that will permit  investigators in the Plant Sciences Building at The University of  Georgia to profit from this technology. A single instrument that will  provide images of media labelled with both radioisotopic and  non-radioisotopic probes is requested. Supporting items include a  microcomputer essential for operation of the imager, one high energy  phosphor screen cassette for each major user, one low-energy phosphor  screen cassette to be shared among all users, four chemiluminescence  screen cassettes to be shared among all users, a grey-scale laser  printer for routine and inexpensive output, and site-licensed  image-analysis software. All will be integrated into an existing  computer network that will not only permit data to be moved readily  from the imager to each user s laboratory, but will also provide direct  access to a publication quality color printer and to a CD recorder for  archiving data.      The imaging system (1) will permit us to obtain quantitative  information with greatly enhanced sensitivity and accuracy, and (2)  will dramatically decrease exposure times, permitting experiments to  progress at a much more rapid pace. Current usage of film for imaging  media in the Plant Sciences Building exceeds 4,700/year, indicating  that a digital imager will receive extensive and efficient use. The  instrument will be used primarily with DNA, RNA and protein blots,  labelled with 32p, 1251, 35S, 14C, or with enzymes that yield  chemiluminescence given appropriate substrates. Research programs that  will benefit from the equipment range from mission-oriented (e.g., H.  Roger Boerma) to fundamental (e.g., Kelly Dawe). These programs include  the regulation of virulence genes in a plan t pathogen (Timothy Denny),  intercellular movement of plant viruses and intracellular movement of  viral glycoproteins (C. Michael Deom), characterization of root-knot  nematode secretions (Richard Hussey and Celeste Ray), genetic  improvement of pest resistance and stress tolerance in soybean (H.  Roger Boerma), use of molecular markers in plant breeding and evolution  (Gary Kochert), characterization of two pathways of polyamine synthesis  in plants (Russell Malmberg), the genetics and cell biology of the  maize meiotic centromere and kinetochore (Kelly Dawe), and a  comparative evaluation of the phytochrome gene family and its  expression in tomato and soghum (Lee Pratt and Marie-Michele  Cordonnier-Pratt).      In transmission electron microscopy of biological structures, there  are two phenomena that often prevent imaging at the molecular level:  radiation damage and contamination. These problems can be reduced by  two approaches: protecting the specimen and/or improving the  microscope.      In the first approach, significant progress has been achieved.  Firstly, a special apparatus has been developed for rapid  cryoimmobilization of a living cell during light microscopic  observation for further imaging as this cell's cryo-whole-mount.  Cellular architecture is retained at the molecular level and therefore  can be referred directly to the behavior of the living cell (Malecki  1992, Proc. EMSA 50: 566-567. Secondly, the deep negative staining /  embedding procedure has been developed. A thick and uniform layer of  embedment supports and protects the three-dimensional structure within  the whole-mount. This electron-dense preparation is only transparent  for electrons with high energies attainable at high accelerating  voltages (Ris&Malecki 1993, J. Struct. Biol. 111:148-157).      In this project, as the second approach, the aim is to improve the  microscope for work",
