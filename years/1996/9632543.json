 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr.  Darryl Williams, Department of Chemistry, Wayne State University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division under a Research Planning Grant to develop high   oxidation state organometallic compounds as chromophores.  Compounds   containing tantalum and tungsten bound to nitrido, alkylidyne, imido,   oxo, and cyclopentadienyl ligands will be synthesized, and the reactivity   of their electronic excited states will be explored.  The goal is to   examine the factors which determine the strength of the metal-ligand   multiple bond and the relationship of absorption and emission data to   this interaction.  Ultimately, this informaton will be used to control   and design luminescent compounds using these linkages. These planning   activities will advance Dr. William's career by providing a basis for   preparing a competitive NSF research proposal subsequent to the   completion of this Research Planning Grant.   Compounds containing the metals tantalum and tungsten will be prepared in   which multiple bonds can be formed to oxygen, nitrogen and carbon atoms.    These compounds have luminescent properties which can be manipulated by   the substituents bound to the metal and to the multiply bonded atoms.     The electronic structure and excited state reactivities of a series of   these compounds will be investigated.  The potential advantage of these   systems over those currently available is a higher degree of control over   the luminescent properties.",
