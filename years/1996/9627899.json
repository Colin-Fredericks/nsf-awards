 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9627899  William Haynes  NIST    As part of a seven month sabbatical leave period, the investigator proposes to collaborate with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) - Thermophysics Division in defining improved theoretical and experimental methods to evaluate the physical properties of dilute solutions, especially as applied to environmental parameter evaluation and related applications.  This type of data is essential in the design of \"clean\" chemical manufacturing processes and prediction of pollutant fate and transport.  Unfortunately, little is currently being done to correct the lack of reliable data in the dilute regime.  In turn, the lack of carefully measured experimental data impedes the development of robust and accurate ostimation methods.  In light of these deficiencies, filling this need has been identified by NIST and the investigator as an area of significant national importance for both industry and government.",
