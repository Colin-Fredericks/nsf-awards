 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623205 Jaffe  This award provides funding for a project involving the search  for and implementation of algorithms for classifying binary  linear codes.  These algorithms are codified in a language, under  development, which facilitates the mechanical verification of  proofs about binary linear codes. One method is to take a  generalized weight enumerator, and use it to generate a linear  programming problem, as Delsarte did with the ordinary weight   enumerator.  Thse linear programming problems tend to be large,  and thus are not generally amenable to hand calculation.  One  particularly promising weight enumerator is the split weight  enumerator arising from a partition of n, where n is the length  of the code.  Using this method and others, many new specific  results about binary linear codes will be proved.  In turn, these  may suggest new algorithms and closed-form general statements.  This research is about error-correcting codes, a fundamental  topic in mathematical combinatorics, computer science, and  electrical engineering.  Such codes are indispensable whenever  information must be transferred across noisy channels from one  place to another.  For example,they are used in compact disk  players to get digitized music from the surface of the CD to the  inside of the player, and in communications between the earth and   orbiting satellites.  Error-correcting codes work by creatively  incorporating redundancy into the transmitted message, to permit  the receiver to detect and correct those errors introduced in  transit, which were caused  by (for instance) dust on the surface  of the CD or cosmic rays. A code is  good if it allows the  detection and correction of many errors without incurring the  expense of excessive redundancy.  This award funds both a search  for good codes and an investigation into the mathematical  limitations of how good they can be.",
