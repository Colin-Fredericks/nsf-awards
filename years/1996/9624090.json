 "awd_abstract_narration": "Andrea Liu is supported by a Faculty Early Career Development Award from   the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study equilibrium   phase behavior and diffusive transport in near-critical fluids, such as   vapor-liquid systems or binary liquid mixtures, confined in dilute porous   media such as silica gels.  In general, the behavior of a near-critical   fluid in a porous medium is an extremely difficult theoretical problem,   because the surface of the medium strongly prefers one phase of the fluid   and because the structure of the medium is highly disordered.  The   approach used by Liu focuses on the strong interaction between the fluid   and the surface; previous theoretical work has assumed that the   interaction is weak and that disorder is the dominant factor.   The   keystone of the proposal is a model of the confining medium as a simple   periodic network of cylindrical strands, which Liu has solved within the   mean-field approximation. The proposed work builds on this basic model by   using a coordinated combination of analytic and numerical techniques to   investigate the effects of critical fluctuations and long-wavelength   disorder in the gel structure, as well as the nonequilibrium behavior.     This approach represents the best hope of isolating the effects of   surface interactions and of disorder in the geometry of the medium in   order to determine their relative importance for equilibrium and   nonequilibrium behavior.  The proposed education plan is centered around   effective scientific communication. The objectives are to demystify   science for non-majors and to convince them that chemistry is an   important and interesting part of daily life, and to teach majors and   graduate students how to communicate their work more effectively.  Nearly critical fluids in dilute porous media, such as those studied by   Liu, are models for more general multiphase fluids in more realistic   porous media.  Applications that are of industrial importance range from   catalysis in porous beds, to storage of liquid wastes and liquid fuels in   porous glasses, to the extraction of liquids such as oil from porous   media like sandstone.  An improved theoretical understanding of transport   in porous media could have a significant impact in several of these   strategic areas.",
