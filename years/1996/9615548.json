 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615548  Mooney    The NSF, the USGS, and the State Seismological Bureau (SSB) of the  People's Republic of China (PRC) have conducted a joint program of  earthquake studies since 1980.  This cooperative activity takes  place under an official protocol between the three parties (see  attached copy of Protocol and extensions).  The original protocol  lasted for 5 years and it has been extended in five year increments  in 1985, 1990 and 1995.    Under the terms of the protocol, representatives of the parties  meet once a year to review progress and set the agenda for the  coming year.  NSF and USGS have agreed to split the cost of these  coordinators meetings whenever they occur in the U.S. (every other  year).  The past two meetings have been paid for by the USGS, since  during this time period they have had most of the \"action\" under  the protocol and since the Chinese delegation visited USGS  facilities during those meetings.    This interagency transfer represents NSF's share of the expenses  for the past two meetings.  ***",
