 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9561346  Cremer         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigates the implementation of a detailed model of turbulent mixing and reaction into a comprehensive reacting flow code.  The overall objective involves demonstration of the feasibility of coupling the Linear Eddy Model (LEM) of scalar transport in turbulent flows with a model for momentum transport based on the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes equations.  The LEM has been shown to provide a physically realistic representation of turbulent mixing in a number of geometries involving reactive and nonreactive flows.  Finite-rate kinetics will be implemented using an approach based on the intrinsic low-dimensional manifold method or a reduced mechanism.  Feasibility of the overall methodology will be based on a comparison of model predictions of species concentrations, temperature distribution, and effects of changes in mixing parameters to existing experimental data for a jet diffusion flame.       Reaction Engineering International (REI) currently markets three software products for the computer simulation of turbulent reacting flows.  REI continuously develops and applies these tools to aid in the design and manufacture of advanced combustion systems.  Incorporating a turbulent mixing model into the firm's reacting flow codes will provide more accurate predictions of trace pollutant species generated in a combustion process.  This improved capability will increase the applicability of these tools and the potential to attract outside investment to further develop our modelling tools.  The improved tools will be accessible to industry via product sales and consulting services provided by REI.  These tools will be particularly useful in the development of new low emission burner systems for process heaters used in the chemical process industry.  ***",
