 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal seeks to understand the effects of climate on the structure of the nasal  complex by examining the crania of two similar non-human primate groups, Macaca  fascicularis and Macaca mulatta, that inhabit different environments.  A deeper understanding  of the nasal complex (nose, nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses) is essential for the testing of  hypotheses regarding its functional adaptation and evolution in primates.  Previous studies on  the effects of climate have usually been limited to external craniofacial landmarks.  This study  approaches the question by assessing data from both internal dimensions and volumes in  combination with more traditional external measures.  It is hypothesized that there will be  significant osteological differences in nasal complex morphology for macaques inhabiting  different climates.  These differences may reflect the accommodation of respiratory mucosa, the  primary modifier of inspired air.  Methods to be used will include: 1) linear measurements using  traditional anthropological techniques; 2) a seed-filling method that permits volumetric  assessment of the maxillary sinus and nasal cavity to yield estimates of the respiratory mucosal  area; and 3) the application of new advances in CT-imaging which will allow both for precise  visualizations of internal nasal components, and permit measurements of their surface areas.    This study will provide new insight for understanding the functional adaptations of the nasal  complex in primates, especially in regard to interactions between climate and respiratory  demands. The use of new methodologies for assessing nasal volume and CT-scanning for  determining internal surface areas, coupled with traditional craniometric measures, will provide  a more in depth, multidimensional approach than attempted previously.",
