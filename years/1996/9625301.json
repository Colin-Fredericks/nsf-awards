Biotechnology is expected to contribute substantially to the U.S. economy.  However, ethnic minorities are highly underrepresented in this area of science.  This award supports a workshop at Tuskegee University (April 20-22, 1996) on transgenic plant research that will provide a forum for students and faculty from minority institutions to learn first-hand about the latest research findings from leading scientists in plant molecular biology.  The goal is to promote research activity in plant molecular biology at minority institutions and provide an opportunity for students and faculty to interact and network with established plant molecular biologists.  The speakers will talk on the application of transgenic plants to study fundamental biology in such areas as plant disease and pest resistance, stress tolerance, improvement of food quality and for the production of novel compounds such as biodegradable plastics and vaccines.  We will also have speakers on ecological, regulatory, ethical, commercial and international aspects of transgenic plants.  Administrators from minority institutions and federal funding agencies will be invited to participate in a panel discussion on research funding opportunities for minority institutions and identify strategies to promote minority participation in plant molecular biology research at both majority and minority institutions.",
