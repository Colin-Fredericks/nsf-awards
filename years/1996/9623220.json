In   the first part of the proposal we deal with two unsolved problems of   this kind, namely the microcanonical ensemble for: point vortices;  for classical gravitating hard particles. In both systems one has   encountered technical problems due to nonconcavity of the entropy.  We propose a new strategy that circumvents these problems by   reinstalling concavity in a higher-dimensional parameter space  from which the original problem obtains by some kind of projection.  Progress in this area should significantly advance our understanding   of nonlinear PDE without convexity and their relation to statistical  mechanics. In the second part of the proposed project we deal directly  with properties of systems of nonlinear PDEs that are firmly established  in their relationship to statistical mechanics. Our main interest is in   the symmetry properties of solutions. We recently constructed sharp   isoperimetric estimates for two-dimensional elliptic PDE systems and   compared them to a priori identities of Rellich-Pohozaev type, thus   firstly obtaining conditions under which solutions are radially symmetric   without requiring uniqueness or minimizing properties. We want to   continue this research and optimize the conditions for two-dimensional   elliptic systems such as Ginzburg-Landau and Bennett equations, extend   the technique to higher dimensions and apply it to Thomas-Fermi models,  finally extend the technique to parabolic transport equations such as  Landau-Boltzmann equations, which in particular should yield a global   existence result in time.   %%%  Long-lived vortices are an ubiquitous feature   in turbulent flows, with hurricanes in the Earth's weather system and   the great red spot in Jupiter's atmosphere being two promin ent examples.   Vortices also occur as structural defects in superfluids, superconductors.   Beside being of scientific interest, it is of pressing technical and   meteorological importance to understand precisely the conditions under   which such vortices do form. An integer part of the proposed project aims   at making a significant contribution to this endeavor. The mathematical   framework consists of certain systems of nonlinear partial differential   equations which are deeply rooted in the scientific discipline of statis-  tical mechanics. The techniques which shall be developed in the first part   of the proposed project will allow us to extract the relevant differential   equations from statistical mechanics under far more realistic conditions   than  treated so far. In the second part, we shall further develop a  recent technique of us that yields qualitative and quantitative statements  about the symmetry properties of the solutions to the nonlinear equations.  In favorable cases this reduces the complexity of certain equations   significantly. Beside vortices, we aim at applying our techniques to the  problem of controlling more realistic plasma structures than previously  treated, of the following categories: charged particle beams, which are   of preeminent interest in various branches of technology development;   stellar structures, which are of basic astrophysical interest. Finally,   we see the possibility of an extension of our techniques to a dynamical   set of transport equations for plasmas which have significance, in  particular, for peaceful thermonuclear energy research.   ***",
