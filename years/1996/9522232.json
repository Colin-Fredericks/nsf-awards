 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Directorate for Mathematical and  Physical Sciences by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials  Research and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and  co-supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Basic  Energy Sciences, enables the Consortium for Advanced Radiation  Sources (CARS) to design, build, and operate an allocated sector  dedicated primarily to structural and condensed matter chemistry  and materials research at the Advanced Photon Source (APS)  synchrotron X-ray facility.  During the tenure of this forty-  eight month continuing grant, Drs. Stuart Rice and James Viccaro  of the University of Chicago, Benjamin Chu of the State  University of New York at Stony Brook, Philip Coppens of the  State University of New York at Buffalo, Peter Pershan of Harvard  University, and Mark Schlossman of the University of Illinois at  Chicago will lead a team of experts to instrument the insertion  device beamline at Sector 18 at the APS that will enable research  in three areas: (1) surface and interfacial properties in soft  condensed matter, molecular liquids, and liquid metals; (2)  static and time-dependent interfacial and bulk properties of  novel polymers and composites, including properties of  supramolecular and mesoscopic structures; and (3) chemical  crystallography, with emphasis on anomalous scattering, time  resolution, and high spatial and energy dispersion.  In this project, it is intended that the sector to be developed  will serve as the primary access to the APS for scientists who  comprise the ChemMatCARS group of investigators within CARS, and  that there will also be made available 25% of beamtime to  scientists in the chemistry and materials research communities  whose research activities would benefit from this facility.",
