Dr. Morrey will work with Dr. Yoshitaka  Nagahama, professor in the Department of Developmental  Biology, Laboratory for Reproductive Biology, on a project  is entitled \"Endocrine Correlates of Sex Change: Importance  of Key Steroido-genic Enzymes\".    The proposed research will analyze sequential, protogynous  hermaphroditism in teleost fishes in an effort to understand  the simultaneous process of sex determination and sexual  differentiation.  As an individual undergoes the transition  from female to male, physiolo-gical pathways must be  redetermined.  Similarly, corresponding mechanisms of male  differentiation must be activated.  Although steroid  hormones are generally considered downstream mediators of  sexual differentiation, the fate of teleost germ cells may  be significantly influenced by hormonal profiles.  Consequently, teleost sex-determining cascades may be post-  maturationally labile and triggered by steroid hormones.  To  begin investigating potential roles for steroid hormones,  previous research has focused on expression studies  involving key steroidogenic enzymes, particularly cytochrome  P450 aromatase and cytochrome P450 11b-hydroxylase.  The  proposed research extends this line of investigation in two  ways.  First, translation of messenger RNA of the respective  enzymes will be verified using immunocytochemical  techniques.  Combined with messenger RNA content, these  results will determine the potential for the transitional  gonad to produce steroid hormones by confirming the presence  or absence of protein. Second, collaborative efforts  involving several different model species will lend insight  into potential similarities among systems.  Results of these  comparative studies will determine the applicability of a  general model for the role of steroid hormone s in the  regulation of sex change.  Overall, the proposed research  will provide a solid foundation from which to base future  investigations of the physiological mechanisms regulating  sex change in teleosts by providing critical information  concerning potent mediators of sexual differentiation.  ***",
