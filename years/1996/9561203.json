 "awd_abstract_narration": "9561203  McLagan     Children with hearing disabilities are often unable to express themselves or to communicate specific concepts in brief words using text or sign language, especially scientific and mathematical concepts, due to limitations in  technical English vocabulary or unfamiliarity with the appropriate sign.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on developing and demonstrating the feasibility of providing an illustrated, interactive American Sign Language (ASL)/Science dictionary for children with hearing disabilities using interactive videodisk (IVD) technology.  The dictionary will use text, graphics, video, animation, and ASL signs to define new words for elementary school level.  The child can call words via keyboard, touch screen, IVD controls, or other input devices and display the word definition in both English and ASL or can input a definition via selection of ASL signs or English words to identify representative words.  The first phase of the research entails producing a prototype of a first dictionary (about 1,500 words) appropriate for middle school on a microprocessor, using an authoring workstation.  Each frame will display a word, a video of the ASL representation of the word and definition of the word,  and a graphical illustration of what the word represents (this illustration can be still graphics, video image, or animated graphics or cartoons).  The prototype dictionary will be alpha tested, and evaluated by subject-matter-experts prior to introduction to other student's display media, and by users.  Means to reduce the cost for use in schools and at home will be sought for eventual implementation on an IVD system.   This project will create a dictionary that can be directly used by children with hearing disabilities.  The tools developed offer an unlimited opportunity to present persons with hearing impairments with almost all voice and text material available to the majority of our nation's population.  The technique involved in its creat ion can be applied to a vast array of educational materials serving a broad range of demographic groups.  These applications include illustrated dictionaries for adults, games,  entertainment and training products.",
