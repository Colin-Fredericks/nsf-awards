 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of  ten  undergraduate students each year in independent research studies  of tallgrass prairie ecology at the Konza Prairie Research  Natural Area (KPRNA)/ Long-Term Ecological Research Site of  Kansas State University.  Long-term subjects of investigation at  the site include study of the impact of fire and grazing on  native tallgrass prairie vegetation.  To facilitation  investigation of these variables, all watersheds on Konza Prairie  have been assigned to different burn regimes and native and  domestic grazers have been introduced to some watersheds.  The  watershed level manipulations on KPRNA offer a unique opportunity  for the study of many aspects of prairie ecology.  Currently, 41  Kansas State University faculty, 32 visiting scientists, 29  graduate students, and 15 undergraduate researchers are working  on 126 research projects on KPRNA.  The REU Sites Program on  KPRNA will feature several components including an independent  research project, a seminar/discussion course in grassland  ecology, a course in bioethics and ecology, and a trip to a  national scientific meeting.  Each REU student will have a  faculty mentor as well as contact with resident graduate students  and research associates.  KPNRA REU students will interact with  other undergraduates who are brought to campus each summer, at  the invitation of other programs, to do research in other  scientific disciplines.  At the conclusion of the summer,  students will make an oral presentation of the results of their  research and prepare the results for publication.  There will be  a yearly assessment of the program by student and faculty  participants in order to insure that the REU program continues to  provide a quality experience to all participants.       This award will foster the continued education and training  of individuals who will be part of the next generation of basic  researchers in the ecology.  It will also serve to produce  citizens informed about vari ous aspects of environmental sciences  and management and decision making in environmental issues.",
