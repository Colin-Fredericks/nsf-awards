 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to develop viable solutions for  topological connectivity and wavelength conversion in all-optical  wavelength-routing networks.  There are two major components to the  proposed research. The first is to develop a comprehensive understanding of  the role of wavelength converters in topology design, routing, and  performance of wavelength-routing networks. In particular, we will  investigate the effects of a variable number of converters in a network and  address the problem of wavelength converter placement in the network. We  will analyze the behavior of the network with a nonuniform traffic demand.  The effect of network topology and wavelength conversion on the blocking  performance will be investigated. We will also explore issues in supporting  multicast traffic and in network interconnection.    The second component of the project is to develop wavelength-routing  algorithms with a distributed control paradigm. In the resulting network,  each node makes routing decisions dynamically based on a precomputed set of  preferred paths and the current occupancy of wavelengths in its  neighborhood. We will develop novel network management and control  mechanisms in  this environment.    An important issue in the practical implementation of a fiber-based wide  area network is its ability to survive link failures without serious  disruption. We will address this issue by studying the tradeoff between  physical connectivity, wavelength conversion, and fault tolerance.",
