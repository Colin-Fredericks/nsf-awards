The project concerns gap junctions, which are gated membrane channels between paired cells in multicellular animals which allow for intercellular communication and exchange of small metabolites and ions.  The channels consist of two paired hexamers of the protein, connexin, with one hemichannel contributed from each cell of the pair.  The connexins are a family of related proteins with a common folding motif.  Different connexins can be found in the same tissue, and different connexins can be localized to the same gap junctional plaques (patches of membrane with abundant junctions).  Sometimes connexons composed of different connexins can dock together, presumably due to conservation of the extracellular domains of the proteins.  However, not all connexins can pair with other connexins, giving rise to selectivity between different connexins.  Gap junctions can be considered an example of a naturally occurring two dimensional quasi-crystal.  The packing and numbers of channels that pack in gap junctions are important factors in communication between two neighboring cells of a tissue.  The overall goal of this project is to image gap junction assemblies within whole cells.  Specifically, the aim is to spatially map the size, location and packing of gap junctions within cells.  This will involve immunocytochemical techniques, confocal microscopy and tomography, as well as advanced image analysis of the three-dimensional reconstructions to determine models of packing and organization.  The model system to be employed is the liver, because there is a great deal of background information available for connexin32 gap junctions in liver.  In addition, these techniques will be applied to patterns of expression of Cx26 in liver.  Subsequently, the methods and results developed with the liver tissue system will be applied to other tissue systems, such as heart tissue and Schwann cells.  ***",
