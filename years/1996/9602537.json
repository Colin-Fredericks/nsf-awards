 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor David S. Perry and a graduate  student of the University of Akron to collaborate in  chemistry research with Professor T. R. Rizzo and his  research group at the Molecular Physical Chemistry  Laboratory of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in  Lausanne, Switzerland.  They propose to study energy  redistribution within energized methanol molecules.  They  will examine three different frequency regions by various  methods which take advantage of complementary expertise and  equipment within the collaborating US and Swiss research  groups.  Specifically, the fundamental regions will be  studied by direct absorption spectroscopies in Akron, and  the higher overtone regions will be studied by infrared-  assisted photofragment spectroscopy in Lausanne.  The nature and quantity of reagent vibrational energy has  long been recognized as a crucial factor in controlling  chemical reactivity.  Redistribution of vibrational and  rotational energy is known to occur on several timescales.  As energy is increased, the relevant interactions appear  first as discrete perturbations, then as clumps of  eigenstates, and finally as unresolvably dense contours.  This collaboration will study a particular system, methanol,  over a wide range of energies and time scales, in order to  improve understanding and discrimination of that range of  analytical responses.",
