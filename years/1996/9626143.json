 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9626143   William Mitchell and Jean Larson, U. Florida    Dr. Mitchell will investigate the core model, particularly near or at the  first Woodin cardinal. This is the point at which the structure of the  universe of sets seems to make a radical change. The aim of this project is  better to understand this change. Dr. Larson's research concerns the  combinatorial properties of small ordinals, specifically countable ordinals  above the first countable ordinal of infinite exponent, and uncountable  ordinals which are squares of cardinals. Ordinals are the backbone of the  set theoretic universe, as well as the basis for many model-theoretic  constructions. Additionally, they are used to assess complexity in proof  theory.    The sequence of ordinals (which are the numbers used to list possibly  infinite sets)  and the core model of set theory each provide part of the  supporting structure of the universe of set theory.  The funded projects  seek a better understanding of these structures at critical points in their  architecture.  The aim in both instances is a keener understanding of the  very fundamental building blocks of mathematics, namely numbers and sets.",
