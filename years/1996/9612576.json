 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, seeks to create, stimulate, and sustain interest in  science among sophomore and junior level high school students by  providing them the opportunity to take an intense, college-level  lecture and laboratory course in analytical chemistry.   Professors Mildred Smalley and Robert Miller of the Department of  Chemistry at Southern University in Baton Rouge will lead a  course for approximately sixteen high school students with  assistance from two high school chemistry teachers.  The course  will use problems in environmental chemistry to illustrate  principles of analytical chemistry and to convey to these  students a sense of the excitement that is attendant to careers  in chemistry.  This project is aimed at attracting  underrepresented minority student into successful careers in  science.  An intense college-level course in environmental analytical  chemistry will be made available on a competitive basis for some  sixteen high school sophomores and juniors from the Baton Rouge  area.  Two high school chemistry teachers will serve as teaching  assistants in this course.  Particular attention is given to  attracting underrepresented minority students to science pursuits  and to enhancing the likelihood of their future success in  scientific careers.",
