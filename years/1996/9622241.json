It is planned to  measure the temperature fields generated during dynamic  deformation and fracture of these advanced materials.  The  results of a complete study of the coupling between damage and  thermal effects in these materials is needed for the formulation  of physically meaningful and accurate thermomechanical damage  models for advanced materials and composites.  This is an  important aspect of material behavior which deserves careful  study, especially in advanced materials.  This equipment will be  used in several current research projects and will also be  available for use by other faculty at the University.  ***",
