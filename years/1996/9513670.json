There has been a significant amount of new information on the role of heat shock proteins synthesis, protein folding, transport and secretion.  In addition, there has been substantial progress on the biochemical properties of these heat shock proteins and chaperones, on the regulation of the genes that encode these proteins, and on the role, regulation and function of heat shock proteins in a wide range of human diseases.  the field of heat shock proteins and molecular chaperones has gown rapidly and draws interest from a number of traditional scientific disciplines in the basic sciences and has  embraced numerous areas of biomedical research including infectious diseases, cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative disease.  This meeting, in the tradition of Cold Spring Harbor meetings, will emphasize new discoveries in these areas.  The meeting will include seven lecture and three poster sessions.  The proposed sessions include: I-Biochemical and biophysical aspects of chaperone-dependent protein folding, II-Import and folding of precursor proteins into organelles and secretion into the extracellular space, III-The protein folding, IV-The role of chaperones in recognition of the protein degradative machinery, V-The  transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of genes encoding chaperones, VI-Stress tolerance: Protection of  critical cellular targets against protein damage, and VII-The Stress Response in Disease.  Each session will be chaired by an invited speaker and have eight to nine oral presentations of which only 3-4 talks per session will be pre-invited speakers.  The remaining speakers for each session will be selected from submitted abstracts to reflect diverse participation and to recognize new investigators.  Particular attention will be paid to encourage participation in  the lecture or poster sessions by graduate students, postdctoral fellows, and new investigators in addition to attendance and presentations by leading scientists in the field.  ***",
