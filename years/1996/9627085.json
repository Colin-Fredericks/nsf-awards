The activities will be  organized into five core exhibit areas: New Way Tunnel, Think Tank,  Inventor's Garage, Chemistry Kitchen, and Tech World and will  reinforce educational reform activities in math, science, problem-  solving, team cooperation, and decision making.  In addition to the  large number of interactives, there is a substantial  technology/telecommunications component known as the Tech Forum.   This will serve at the home site for the Kentucky TeleLinking  Network (KTLN).  The educational objectives of the exhibit were  developed under the guidance of prominent formal educators in the  state and they address both the education reform goals of the state  and national science and math standards.  The exhibit has also been  developed with direct participation of a number of private sector  partners.  It is an impressive community effort.  The exhibit is  scheduled to open in March, 1997.",
