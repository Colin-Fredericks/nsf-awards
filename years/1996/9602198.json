 "awd_abstract_narration": "The end of South Africa's apartheid system has led to the  blurring or altering of previously clearly demarcated ethnic,  political, and linguistic divisions within the country. As  rhetorics and policies of separateness have been superseded by  discourses of multicultural unity and equality, so too  ethnically-inflected and gendered social distinctions between  town, township, and village have been eroded by a national  culture now developing in, and emanating from, the urban centers.  The aim of this research is to locate emergent forms of urban  speech which mediate shifting linguistic and social identities,  ethnic and national, in Bophuthatswana, a former \"ethnic  homeland.\"       The urban speech variety in question derives from two kinds  of language, and mediates two kinds of identity for black South  Africans. In areas of North-West Province which were formerly  part of Bophuthatswana, ethnic identity cleaves to Setswana, a  standardized (and now nationally-recognized) language which is  nonetheless socially moribund in urban communities. South African  identity, on the other hand, cleaves to Tsotsitaal, formerly a  criminal argot with roots in the urban townships. Tsotsitaal's  evolution into an urban variety of Setswana, which is  increasingly a medium of urban national culture, is the focus of  this study. It will be investigated in terms of the gendered  nature of shifting social boundaries in South Africa's urban  communities. Research on Tswana peoples' speech behavior and  language ideologies will consist of participant observation,  recording of unelicited \"natural\" conversation, informal  interviews, and archival study. By developing (1) linguistic  descriptions of speech variation and the structural relationship  of Urban Setswana to Standard Setswana, and (2) a historical/  ethnographic account of forces shaping the communities in which  this variation is found, it becomes possible to (3) reach broader  conclusions about language's role in mediating social identities  an d political change.",
