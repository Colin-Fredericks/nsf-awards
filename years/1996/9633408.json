 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633408  Haygood    Iron availability is believed to have an important influence  on the productivity of marine environments.  The chemistry  of iron in the ocean is still poorly understood, but there  is an emerging consensus that iron is largely complexed by  organic compounds in seawater, thus affecting the chemical  behavior of iron, as well as its availability to organisms.  Many bacteria, including some marine species, are known to  produce siderophores, compounds which bind iron.  Such  siderophores may contribute to iron complexation in  seawater. The investigators will study siderophore  production by marine bacteria associated with particles.  This study seeks to determine whether siderophores  participate in iron complexation in seawater, and what  environmental conditions control their production.  Siderophore production by selected marine bacteria will be  studied in the laboratory using biochemical, molecular, and  immunological techniques.  Knowledge of the factors  regulating siderophore production will be useful in  predicting their occurrence in the marine environment and  will lead to a better understanding of iron and its  influence on productivity and community structure in the  ocean.  This information will be immediately useful in  chemical modeling of the behavior of  iron in seawater.  These studies will provide a key link between studies of the  organic iron ligands in seawater, and the role of  bacteria  in influencing the availability of iron to phytoplankton and  bacteria in the ocean.",
