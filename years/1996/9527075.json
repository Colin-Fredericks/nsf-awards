Four, 500m long drillcores will be  taken from a platform of annual sea ice floating in water depths  ranging from 100 to 500m.  The cores will sample a composite  stratigraphic section 1500m thick during two, 45-day-long  drilling seasons (October-November 1996 and 1997).    Shipboard geophysical surveys have identified a package of  dipping sedimentary strata interpreted to be Cretaceous-Miocene  in age.  A thin blanket of younger sediments overlies these beds.  Rocks of this age range are not known from the Ross Sea, the  Transantarctic Mountains or elsewhere in East Antarctica.  Thus,  recovered sediments of this age have prime importance for  interpreting Antarctic geologic, biologic, climatic and tectonic  history during the Cretaceous-Cenozoic. Objectives of CRP include  obtaining a late Cretaceous-Cenozoic paleoclimatic record,  studying glacial-deglacial and eustasy cycles, and determining  the Gondwana breakup and rifting history of the Ross Sea  embayment.    Core description and downhole experiments will be conducted at  each drill site.  An international team of biostratigraphers,  sedimentologists, magnetostratigraphers, petrologists, etc. will  conduct initial characterization of the cores and their  constituents during and immediately following drilling at the  fully equipped Crary Science and Engineering Center (CSEC),  McMurdo Station, Ross Island, Antarctica.    Palynomorphs have proven to be invaluable tools for  biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental interpretation of younger  Ross Sea sequences drilled in the Ross Sea Embayment.  They  include both marine (dinocysts) and nonmarine (spores, pollen)  types, record extensive and diverse geologic information, and are  preserved in a wide variety of lithofacies formed in various  paleoenvironments.    This award suppor ts initial palynological characterization of the  CRP drillcores, in collaboration with New Zealand palynologists.  All samples will be processed in the CSEC using a focused  mircowave digestion unit for maximum safety and effieciency.  Analyses will focus on providing palynological input for an  integrated biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental framework  based on all microfossils groups present.  This critical  framework is of fundamental importance to all future geologic,  geophysical and paleontologic studies conducted on the cores and  in the drilling area.  Palynology will also provide vital data  for prime CRP objectives: climate change, eustasy, and thermal  and tectonic history.  Future palynologic studies of the cores  include such topics as paleoenvironments, vegetational and  climatic change, taxonomy, evolution of southern marine and  terrestrial floras, endemism, dispersal and paleobiogeography,  and extinction events.",
