 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many families of graphs including interval graphs, permutation  graphs, trapezoid graphs, and co-comparability graphs  demonstrate a type of linear ordering on their vertex sets.  It  is precisely  this linear order that is exploited, in one form  or another, in a  search for efficient algorithms for these  classes of graphs.  The classes mentioned are known to have  wide-ranging practical applications.  In addition, they are all  subfamilies of the class  of graphs called the asteroidal  triple-free graphs (AT-free  graphs, for short).  This project  extends the research completed under CCR-94-07180:  the PI has  shown that every connected AT-free graph contains a dominating  pair (i.e., a pair (x,y) of vertices with the property that all  (x,y)-paths represent dominant sets), which can be found in  linear time.  In spite of these encouraging first steps in the  study of AT-free graphs,  the structure of the AT-free graphs  is not well understood.  In  particular, no efficient  recognition algorithm is available.  The research effort  investigates the ATfree graphs using the  powerful tool of  graph decomposition, with the intention to  reveal new  structural properties of AT-free graphs that can be  exploited  to obtain efficient sequential and parallel algorithms.  The  results provide a unifying look and a common algorithmic base  from which to investigate the four classes of graphs mentioned  above.***",
