 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530878  COBURN    This project will provide support for shipboard scientific    support equipment for the research vessels ATLANTIS II, KNORR and  OCEANUS, operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,    and dedicated to use in support of ocean science research.        The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe    conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support  for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the  deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational  equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite    receivers to pin point the location of research sites,    communication equipment including radio transceivers and    satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data    communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats    for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.        The Project Director, Joseph L. Coburn is fully qualified to    direct this project having had considerable experience in    overseeing similar activities.        This project will allow the institution to upgrade the OCEANUS's  winch systems with the addition of a spare winch drum, video  monitoring equipment, a boom rest and guy wire for the crane, and  improve safety with a new EPIRB for the OCEANUS, new gas detectors  for the KNORR and OCEANUS, and a new gangway and raised stern rails  on the OCEANUS.  The project will improve communications with new  radios for the KNORR and OCEANUS, and acquire a pressure washer for  the OCEANUS.  ***",
