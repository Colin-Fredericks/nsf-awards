 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625960  Lanford  This award is to develop a compact, broad range magnetic  spectrometer to be used in ion beam analysis for materials  research.  This spectrometer is designed to be used as a  detector for Rutherford backscattering (RBS) wihich will allow  the measurement of RBS spectra with equal ease and precision as  current systems, but with more than a factor of ten better  energy resolution.  This order of magnitude improvement in  energy resolution translates into an order of magnitude  improvement in the near surface depth and mass resolution of  RBS.  With this spectrometer, 4HeRBS will have mass resolution  better than (i.e. smaller than) 1 amu for all target nuclei and  will have a near surface depth resolution approaching atomic  dimensions.  One novel feature of this spectrometer is the  ability to measure RBS spectra with a large solid angle  centered at 180o where kinematic broadening is minimized  (dE/d=0) for all target masses.  An extended focal plane allows  the simultaneous measurement of relative intensity of He+ and  He++ ions in order to correct for charge fraction effects.    Although designed with the needs of RBS as a primary concern,  this spectrometer can also be sued as a detector in nuclear  reaction analysis (NRA) and energy recoil detection (ERD),  where the high energy resolution will again translate into  dramatic improvement in the depth resolution attainable by  these analytic methods.  %%%    This instrument is likely to provide substantially improved  capability for materials analysis, and will provide training to  students.  He will provide important feedback for processing  development and device fabrication.  ***",
