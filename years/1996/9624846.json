 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many years, the poor design of interactive systems has  been attributed to insufficient communication between  developers and end users. Usability practices from the field  of human-computer interaction are not currently integrated  into the theory and practice of software engineering. This  research project pursues three objectives:  1) developing a  model of software development as a process of on-going  communication; 2) providing support for this model through  active mechanisms in software tools; and 3) improving the  accessibility and acceptance of usability methods by  software practitioners.  In general, the objectives reflect  a process and philosophy of human-centered software  development.  Active support is being investigated through a mechanism  called expectation agents. Expectation agents are software  mechanisms that monitor the usage of prototype systems and  detect mismatches between actual usage and developers'  design assumptions or expectations.  Such breakdowns are  opportunities for communication which make explicit the  expectations of both developers and end users.  Expectation  agents serve as a test vehicle for supporting on-going  communication in software development, for adapting  usability practices to software practice, and for  reinforcing developers' understanding of human-computer  interaction.  This research proceeds along three dimensions: theoretical,  technical, and empirical. The research is developing a model  of ongoing communication in software development, refining  models of the software processes involved in developing  interactive systems, and improving understanding of  usability methods for workplace settings.  In the technical  dimension, the research provides new algorithms and  representations for capturing and communicating design  intent and active mechanisms such as expectation agents to  operate over design intent. These mechanisms involve both  formal and semi-formal representations. The empirical  component includes a critical analysi s of the approach as a  means of gathering usability information and supporting  communication in systems development.  This CAREER research project also addresses the software  engineering curriculum. First, the work seeks to improve the  curricula for educating software engineers in the methods of  human-computer interaction.  Second, adoption of systematic  practice is aided by tools and methods.  The research  project seeks to meet this need by adapting and, where  possible, automating usability methods for software  engineering.  ***",
