 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522286  Halley  This project constructs computational models to describe the  electrode-electrolyte interface, with particular emphasis on  models of metal electrodes and aqueous electrolytes.  Using  direct dynamics methods, which have not been applied to  these interfaces by others before, the electronic structure  of the constituents of the interface is recalculated at each  step of the simulation of the atomic motion.  More  traditional methods are qualitatively incorrect because of  the mobility of the molecules of the liquid.  Preliminary  work is being improved upon in several stages, beginning  with the inclusion of nonlocal pseudopotentials and various  computational improvements to study the potential dependence  of the interfacial capacitance.  The next stage studies the  reconstruction of noble metal surfaces under potential  control in electrochemical environments.  The third stage  investigates deposition and dissolution.  Progress in the  proposed directions will contribute to understanding  chemical reactions at interfaces in diverse technological  contexts, including catalysis, corrosion, electroplating,  and the understanding, development, and improvement of  microelectronic processing techniques and advanced  batteries.  %%%  This project constructs computer models to describe the  electrode-electrolyte interface, with particular emphasis on  models of metal electrodes and aqueous electrolytes.  Such  interfaces are found in batteries, fuel cells, corrosive  environments, and in the electronics industry.  The  investigators have developed preliminary computer codes of a  type that no other has ever applied to such systems.  Other,  more conventional approaches fail because they do not do a  good job describing the liquid.   The project proceeds in  three states of increasing complexity, eventually addressing  the change in the structure of the metal surface, and adding  material to or taking material away from the metal surface.  Progress in the proposed directions will contr ibute to  understanding chemical reactions at interfaces in diverse  technological contexts, including catalysis, corrosion,  electroplating, and the understanding, development, and  improvement of microelectronic processing techniques and  advanced batteries.  ***",
