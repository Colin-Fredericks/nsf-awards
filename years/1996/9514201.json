 "awd_abstract_narration": "In human vision, it is not clear how the visual system maintains the sense of   relative brightness under widely varying conditions of lighting.  This work   exploits an approach using \"induction\", where a neighboring field affects the   perceptual quality of a target field; for example, a gray area next to a dark   background looks bright, while the same gray area against a light background   looks dark.  This illusion works whether the overall illumination is at high or low   levels.  A novel technique based on this property is used here, where the target   is a band and on each side of the band there are both dark and light bars   forming a grating, which induce an illusory grating of varying brightness to   appear within the band itself, which really has a single constant brightness.    Standard matching techniques are used to measure how of dependent the   effects are on mechanisms for contrast, and on global (wide-field) vs. local   (narrow field) spatial brightness mechanisms.     Results from this work will help unravel a fundamental problem in vision, and   will have an impact beyond visual neuroscience to perceptual physiology in   general, and could be important in the design of visual displays for many   applications.",
