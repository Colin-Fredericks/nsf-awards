 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615766  Mathur   Description:  The proposed research  \"Photoinduced Degradation in Doped Hydrogenated  Amorphous Silicon (a-SiH)\" is a collaboration  in materials research between Professor Craig  Taylor, University of Utah and Professors P.C.  Mathur and R.M. Mahra, University of Delhi.   This proposal adds an international component  to Professor Taylor's research on the  properties of disordered semiconductors and  thin-film photovaltaic materials.  Taylor has  made significant progress in understanding  metal chalcogenide glasses as a model system  linking tetrahedrally-coordinated amorphous  materials and traditional chalcogenide glasses.   As a logical extension, this proposal  will  concentrate on photo-induced degradation and  transport properties of n-type doped silicon-  sulfur alloys.             Scope:  This is a new collaboration linking two  university research laboratories in the US and  India.  The research seeks to  understand  metastable defects in a-Si:H that are crucial  for optimum performance of solar cells.  The  research combines US expertise on growth,  optical and magnetic resonance characterization  and Indian expertise on transport and  structural measurements.  The research plan is  designed to make progress on ultimately  improving the stability of devices such as  thin-film transistors and solar cells.   ***",
