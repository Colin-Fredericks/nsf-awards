This grant request is to support  partial travel of students and young faculty to attend this important  meeting.    This meeting was last held in 1994 in Rochester, New York and about 16% of  the participants were students. This year the meeting will be held jointly  with four other topical meetings (Integrated Photonics Research,  Holography, Optical Fabrication and Testing, and Extreme Ultraviolet  Lithography).    The Diffractive Optics Topical Meeting made its debut in New Orleans in  1992. The meeting was held again in 1994 in Rochester, New York. The aim of  this meeting is to bring together scientists and engineers of various  backgrounds to discuss new developments in the various aspects of  diffractive and refractive micro-optics.    Diffractive optics and micro-optics are continuing to find new and  interesting applications. These optical elements provide the potential to  reduce significantly the size, weight, and cost of a variety of optical  systems. In addition, diffractive and refractive micro-optics can be  combined to provide unique system properties.    Some of the topic areas to be discussed are:    * Design & Analysis of Diffractive & Micro-Optics Optical Elements  * Fabrication & Replication of Diffractive Micro-Optics Optical Elements  * Dynamic Diffractive/Micro-Optics Optical Elements  * Applications & New Products  ***",
