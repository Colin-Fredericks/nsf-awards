 "awd_abstract_narration": "959623279  Caudill/Bryan  This research project concerns the study of inverse problems which arise  in using thermal methods for the nondestructive evaluation of materials.  The focus is to investigate the mathematics involved in the use of  techniques for imaging inaccessible portions of some object, e.g., an  inaccessible part of the boundary, or the interior of the object.  Such  inverse problems arise when one uses thermal methods for corrosion  detection.  The program includes the study of uniqueness and continuous  dependence questions, and explores the nature of the dependence of  solutions on relevant model parameters. The results of this analysis  serve as a foundation for designing inversion algorithms which are both  theoretically sound and computationally efficient and reliable. The  investigators also consider other thermal imaging problems, including  the location of interior cracks, delaminations, or voids.  %%%  Inverse problems arise naturally when one mathematically models physical  systems. Such systems almost always have certain unknown properties  which one cannot easily measure directly.  Instead, one gathers more  readily available information and uses mathematical analysis to infer  something about the unknown quantities. For example, by measuring the  energy of an x-ray beam passed through a human body one can create  images of the interior of the body, a process known as a CAT scan.  Other important examples of inverse problems are medical imaging using  MRI and PET scans, acoustic sonograms, and non-destructive evaluation  of metal parts using electromagnetic methods, e.g., eddy currents.  This project concerns the investigation of inverse problems which arise  when one uses thermal methods to detect the presence and extent of  corrosion in the interior of material objects such as aircraft wings  and fuselages.    ***",
