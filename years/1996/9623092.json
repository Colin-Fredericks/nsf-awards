 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623092  Braun    Motivated by the complex transport associated with spreading process such   as the spreading of solder droplets and coating processes, a research   program is proposed on the spreading of a droplet that is covered by a film.    Often in soldering and other processes involving spreading, the drop may   become very thin which indicates the presence of multiple length scales.    Based on the author's previous research, the first approach proposed is a   multi-scale asymptotic analysis (lubrication theory) to derive nonlinear   diffusion equations for the free surfaces; those nonlinear diffusion equations   will be  solved using a spectrally-accurate implementation of the method of   lines.  All quantities of interest may be computed in this approximation   once the required free surfaces have been found. A second approach is also   proposed, via boundary integral equations, under the approximation of   Stokes flow in the drop and film.  This approach relaxes the  requirement   that the drop and film be thin, but still requires that the flow be slow.  We   propose making a direct comparison between the two approaches in order to   evaluate the utility of each in various situations.  The work proposed will   develop models only for the fluid dynamics, and inclusion of reactive   effects will be proposed in a subsequent project.    Important processes in manufacturing involve the spreading of a fluid   droplet in the presence of another fluid; one example is soldering, where, in   many instances, the presence of a thin layer of a second fluid, the flux, is   required for the process to work at all.  Because the use of lead-based solder   is no longer allowed, understanding of this droplet spreading process for   other kind of solder materials would be very helpful in understanding   alternative solder materials. The work proposed in the project is developing   some preliminary models necessary for the development of a complete   model for a spreading solder drop. The proposed program  is to develop   theory for the spreading of a droplet on a flat plate that is covered by a thin   film of a different fluid. Computer codes will be developed that predict how   fast the drop spreads, and the shapes of the drop and the film that covers the   drop. In summary, sophisticated mathematical techniques will be applied to   a problem of technological importance.  The computer codes resulting from   this project are expected to be applicable to related wetting problems in   different technological areas (e.g. coating processes) subsequent to the   completion of this project.",
