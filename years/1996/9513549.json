 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an extensive history of measuring plant  photosynthetic processes and water relations. However, a  major impediment has been the impossibility of actually  determining the light distribution over the entire surface  of a particular plant during a physiological experiment;  plant geometry is just too complex. While much useful  information has been obtained in spite of this, other,  important questions have gone begging. Information of this  type would contribute to the understanding of (1) the  partitioning of biomass among plant components and its  relationship to photosynthesis; (2) examination of subtle  morphological differences between species and subspecies;  (3) influence of photobiology on morphology and phenology  (e.g., elongation, heliotropism); (4) plant morphological  responses to chemical and environmental factors (e.g., water  stress, temperature, and CO2); and many others.    This project seeks to develop a laboratory instrument  capable of measuring transient photosynthetic and  transpiration rates of a plant while simultaneously  determining the complete 3D structure of its canopy. The  instrument will combine elements of machine vision and  stereophotogrammetry with traditional methods of gas  exchange monitoring and online sap flow measurement.    The basic design will involve a gas tight, transparent  chamber containing the experimental plant with connections  to CO2/H2O gas analyzers. Sap flow sensors will be attached  to the plant. All outputs will be monitored by  microcomputer. Illumination will be controlled and the  plants will be photographed at various angles by a  robotically operated camera. Machine vision techniques will  be used to separate the plant from the background and then  segment it into leaves, stems, etc. Multiple images will be  combined through stereophotogrammetry to obtain a solid, 3D  computer model of the plant. The plant surface illumination  distribution can then be calculated using standard radiosity  imaging software.    Given the num ber of plant scientists who make laboratory  measurements of photosynthesis and transpiration, there is a  large potential audience for this device. There is also good  reason for confidence that the effort will be successful.  One PI has already developed a stereophotogrammetry system  which computes and images 3D plant models from manually  digitized photos. The team also includes machine vision  expertise and examples of segmenting digital plant images  exists in the literature. The physiological techniques are  well established and three PI's are versed in their use.  Team members also have experience with data acquisition  system design and general engineering. Finally, appropriate  radiosity codes are available in the public domain.",
