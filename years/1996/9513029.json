 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested for the purchase of a Li-Cor 4000LS automated  deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencer. This equipment is to be used by  no fewer than 5 separate project groups involving a diverse range of  research disciplines at the College of William and Mary. Four of five  principal investigators are faculty at the Virginia Institute of Marine  Science (VIMS), the School of Marine Science campus of the College  located in Gloucester Point, VA. Research project groups at VIMS are  conducting studies on 1) the population genetics, biogeography and  taxonomy of selected marine organisms with emphasis on pelagic fishes,  2) the biology of the phylum Haplosporidia and the phylogenetic  relationship of these protists to other eukaryotes, 3) the  phylogenetics and systematics of the Clitellata including leeches,  oligochaetes and branchiobdellidans, 4) the association of major  histocompatibility complex II  gene alleles in trout with immune  responsiveness, and 5) the origin and maintenance of biodiversity in  marine invertebrate taxa. In addition to the VIMS project groups,  studies in the Department of Biology of the College involve screening  genes that can be used as dorsal-ventral markers in Xenopus to examine  the tissue interactions leading to the determination of the  dorsal-ventral axis in vertebrates.        The collective need for an automated sequencer has been directed by 3  principal criteria: 1) data throughput and efficiency, 2) radiation  safety and 3) centralization. The purchase of the Li-Cor 4000LS  automated sequencer offers considerable advantages to throughput and  efficiency over manual methods currently available at the College of  William and Mary. These advantages include increased base  identification accuracy, increased read-length from a single primer,  and greatly reduced time investment. The use of an automated sequencer  will also eliminate radioactive waste and will reduce the risk of  environmental exposure. Currently, sequencing reactions at the College  ar e run in the presence of 35S labeling. The use of radioactive  material entails the risk of exposure both to the experimenter and to  those working in the same facilities and severely curtails the  opportunities for students, especially undergraduates, to gain  experience with DNA sequencing. In addition, waste disposal is a  problem. The single radioactive waste disposal site available for  eastern Virginia will close on December 31, 1995 and a substitute  facility is not scheduled to be available until the year 2000. In the  interim, all radioactive waste generated at the College must be stored  on site. The laser-detection of infrared excitation in an automated  sequencer does not involve the use of radioactive labeling methods and  thus circumvents impending limitations imposed by accumulating  radioactive waste and experimenter exposure. Moreover, the  non-radioactive detection method makes the technology freely available  and safe for teaching purposes at any level. Centralization of all  sequencing operations will enhance existing interactions among all  project groups.",
