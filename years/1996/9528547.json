Six PIs from six   institutions will complete the final segment of the WOCE  Hydrographic Program Line, S-4, along 60 degrees   South from about 20 degrees East to about 120 degrees East.  The  program is designed to detect subtle   differences across the Kerguelen Plateau, an important hydrographic  boundary for bottom waters.  In addition   to hydrography, the section will include standard tracer  measurements, as well as CFCs, Helium, Tritium, and   Carbon-14, all to WOCE standards.  In addition to the zonal line,  two excursions to the shelf at about 54   degrees East and 96 degrees East will be made to investigate the  Antarctic Slope Front and its associated   westward current.  Expendable current moorings will also be  deployed at several locations to measure, for one   year, the current along the slope and on the flanks of the  Kerguelen Plateau.",
