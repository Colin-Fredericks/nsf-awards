NICL provides NSF- and USGS-funded investigators with the  capability to conduct examinations and measurements of ice cores  while preserving the integrity of these cores in a safeguarded  environment.  NICL fosters the utilization of these cores for  scientific research by handling inquiries from scientists  interested in obtaining samples of ice cores, by making inventory  listings easily available through electronic distribution, by  acting as an information resource to the scientific community and  by improving current technologies for ice core analysis in  accordance with the needs and requirements of their client base.  NICL is located at the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood,  Colorado and is housed administratively within the USGS Office of  the Central Regional Geologist, Geologic Division.",
