 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630904  Gharakhanian     Simian Virus 40 (SV40) is a small DNA virus which undergoes a permissive course of infection in simian cells.  Its major structural protein, Vp1, is the basic unit of its pentameric capsomeres.  It is synthesized in the cytoplasm of the infected cell late in the permissive infection, and along with the minor structural proteins is transported to the nucleus where viral assembly takes place.  The early steps of SV40 assembly, including the early oligomerization of Vp1 and interactions with the minor structural proteins, and the mechanism of its nuclear transport, have not been fully explored.  Several lines of evidence suggest the formation of interactive Vp1 complexes in the cytoplasm prior to nuclear transport.  Evidence suggests that disulfide bonds may be involved in the stable formation of Vp1 oligomers and that oligomerization may play a role in the nuclear transport of Vp1.  Here, we propose studies on the early Vp1 interactive complexes in permissive mammalian cell lines including identifying specific cysteines that may be involved in the disulfide bonded Vp1 oligomerization.  The potential role of oligomerization and complex formation with the minor structural proteins in the nuclear transport of Vp1 will also be explored.  ***",
