 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psarris  9528330  In the past decade much progress has been made in developing  high  performance large scale parallel architectures.  The  development  of fast restructuring compilers for the automatic  parallelization  of sequential programs requires efficient data dependence  analysis techniques in order to obtain exact data dependence  information. The proposed techniques in data dependence  analysis  fall into two categories, either efficient and approximate  tests  or exact and exponential.  The proposed research will  attempt to  show, though, that exact data dependence information can be  computed efficiently in practice.  The GCD test and the  Banerjee  inequality are the two tests most widely used to detect data  dependencies between pairs of array references inside loop  nests.  These tests are approximate in the sense that they are  necessary  but not sufficient conditions for data dependence and,  therefore,  they may introduce artificial dependences which limit  parallelization.  Their major advantages is their low  computation  cost.    A recent study provided necessary and sufficient conditions  for  the accuracy of the GCD and Banerjee tests.  This study has  also  led to the development of the I (Interval) test, an improved  dependence analysis test.  The I Test is more accurate than  a  combination of the GCD and Banerjee tests and is able to  provide  exact data dependence information in practice, unlike the  classic  tests, at no additional computation cost.  The original work  considered only the case of loops with constant loop limits.  In  scientific applications though, inner loop limits may be  linear  functions of the outer loop iteration variables (these  iteration  spaces are termed trapezoidal regions).    This project develops an efficient and accurate dependence  analyzer.  The research has four objectives.  The first  objective  is to derive conditions for the accuracy of the GCD and  Banerjee  tests in general trapezoidal regions and perform and  empirical  stud y of how often these conditions occur in practice. The  second  objective is to extend the I test to the general trapezoidal  regions and to assess its performance benefits on a suite of  benchmark codes.  The third objective is an analytical and  empirical comparison of the I test with all the other tests,  such  as the Omega test, Power test, etc.  An analytical and  experimental evaluation of all the data dependence analysis  tests is essential to determining which tests should be  performed in practice.  The fourth and principal objective  is to  integrate the above research work and develop an improved  dependence analyzer as a part of the Paraphrase-2  parallelizing  compiler.    It is expected that the completion of the proposed research  will  improve the understanding of data dependence analysis,  demonstrate the effectiveness and practical importance of  the  proposed techniques, and significantly improve the state of  the  art in parallelizing compilers.  By providing efdicient and  exact  dependence analysis techniques a number of compiler  optimizations  for high performance computer architectures can be performed  in  practice.  ***",
