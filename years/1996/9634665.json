 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project on the design of realistic uncheatable benchmarks strives to  achieve a more sophisticated design methodology of computer performance  benchmarks, based on the theory of computational complexity.  The goal is  to integrate ideas from randomization and cryptography with realistic  existing benchmark in everyday use.  There has been tremendous progress  in theoretical computer science in recent years, especially with regard  to the power of randomization and interaction.  These ideas are well  suited to the design of uncheatable benchmarks.  The purpose of  benchmark testing is to estimate the performance and reliability of  hardware and software systems. By and large existing benchmark design  has focused on \"typical\" programs and data sets for the system. The  problem of making benchmarks resistant to tampering has been mostly  ignored.  The on-going research in this project has demonstrated the  feasibility of applying ideas from computational complexity and  cryptography to a wide variety of existing benchmarks, and making them  more accurate, resistant to tampering and thus more trustworthy.***",
