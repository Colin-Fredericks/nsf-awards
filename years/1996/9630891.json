 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601382  Sharp    The hippocampal formation is a part of the brain known to be  critically involved in learning and memory.  Hippocampal  damage in humans cause profound, nearly global amnesia for  events which occur after the lesion.  One type of ability  affected is spatial, or navigational learning.  Individuals  with hippocampal damage cannot learn their way around in a  new environment.    Some insight into how the hippocampus may accomplish its  role in spatial learning has come from studies which examine  the physiological signals in the hippocampal formation as  individuals navigate.  One kind of spatial signal is the  place, or locational cell rate, while there are other  regions where the cell fires at lower rates, or is silent.  Thus the cells provide an ongoing indication of the animal's  current location.  In the hippocampus proper, each new  environment is coded using a different pattern of firing in  these cells, so that each environment has its own unique  \"neural map\".    Recently, we have discovered a novel type of locational  signal in a subregion of the hippocampal formation known as  the subiculum.  In the subiculum, each environment is  represented using the same spatial signal.  That is, the  spatial pattern in one environment appears to be a rubber  sheet transformation of the pattern in any other environment  it appears that the subicular cells may each have a single,  abstract, generic firing pattern which is transferred and  shaped to fit into each new enclosure.  Such a generic map  could play a critical role in abstract spatial reasoning.    Several manipulations are planned, in order to further  characterize the subicular spatial signal.  First, the  initial work (above) has only examined cells when recorded  in two subicular patterns can expand and/or contract when  the overall environmental size changes, cells will be  serially recorded in chambers which differ in total area.    In addition, it is not clear how one environment is  demarcated from another, by the s ubiculum.  That is, how do  the subicular cells \"decide\" to make a new replica of the  one environmental area to another?  To examine this issue,  cells will be recorded as animals navigate through  environments in which there are partial boundaries dividing  one enclosure from another, to see what kinds of boundaries  will cause the generation of a new replica of the map.    Finally, the spatial and behavioral firing patterns of cells  in brain regions which project messages onto the subiculum  will be examined, in order to determine what could be the  computational and sensory building blocks for the generic  subicular maps.    The results will be used, along with formal neural network  models, to try to understand the role played by the  hippocampal region in learning and memory generally.",
