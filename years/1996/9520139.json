 "awd_abstract_narration": "All translation-invariant binary image filters possess morphological  representations.  Hence, finding an optimal filter involves finding the  structuring elements that yield a filter having minimum error - in our case,  mean-absolute error (MAE).  This observation leads to automated design procedures  for restoration and enhancement filters when treating both the observed  (corrupted) and ideal images as random set processes.  A key design aspect is  postulation of image models for the ideal and observed processes.  This research  concerns filter robustness relative to modeling assumptions: to what degree is  filter performance degraded relative to deviations from the design assumptions?   Our approach is to assume parameterized ideal and observed image processes and  to consider the effects of applying an optimal filter for a given parameter  vector to images corresponding to different parameter vectors.    The design of enhancement algorithms is an integral part of the manufacture of  electronic office equipment.  This time-consuming (up to a year), and performance  is limited by the ability of a human being to consider only a relatively small  number of possible algorithms.  Recently, enhancement algorithms have been  automatically designed by higher-level algorithms that use statistics in  conjunction with mathematical models of images and imaging systems, thereby  significantly cutting design time while at the same time producing better  enhancement.  The present research investigates design from various image models.   It also addresses the \"robustness\" question: since a designed enhancement  algorithm is based on modeling assumptions, practical application requires that  we have a reasonable idea of how it will perform on image data that differs to  varying degrees from the data on which it has been designed.",
