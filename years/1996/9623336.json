Seeley and Nieh    NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant IBN-9623336:  Mechanisms of food recruitment in a stingless bee, Melipona  panamica.      Large Social insect colonies require a considerable food  intake, yet usually live in competitive environments in  which food sources are widely dispersed.  Faced with these  constraints, many highly social insects in the family  Hymenoptera have evolved mechanisms to bring additional  nestmates (recruits) to a newly discovered feed source.  The  mechanisms employed by stingless bees to communicate food  location are diverse and fascinating, yet poorly understood.  Like many ants, stingless bees in several genera directly  follow foragers to feed source (piloting) or lay scent  trails followed by recruits.  Like honey bees, stingless  bees in the genus Melipona may use sounds to communicate the  distance to the food source.  Recent data indicate that  Melipona panamica foragers can recruit to a specific  distance, direction and canopy level without using scent  trails.    Our goal is to understand how these bees recruit to a  specific 3 dimensional set of coordinates.  Recruiting  foragers perform an intriguing sequence of spinning  movements and pulsed sounds inside the nest.  Foragers also  appear to communicate the food source s direction outside  the nest and deposit an unidentified pheromone at the food  site for local orientation.  The actual mechanisms may offer  a novel solution to the problem of communicating food source  location and will increase our understanding of complex  mechanisms of communication in insect societies.",
