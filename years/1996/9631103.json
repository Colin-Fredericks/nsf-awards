 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631103  Agris   The project has two overall objectives. The first objective is to determine the chemistry/structure/ function relationships of selected modified uridines that have specific, yet unexplained, biological relevance. In the second objective, the chemical and structural contributions of modified nucleosides that explain these biological observations will be used to predict, design and produce RNA structures with certain characteristics.  The specific aims are to: (i). Determine the physicochemical properties of mnm5s2U34 and mcm5s2U34 that contribute to a biologically important and possibly atypical anticodon conformation in tRNALys. Preliminary data indicate that the modified uridines interact with N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine-37 (t6A37) creating a novel, non-covalently produced loop even in as small a model system as a pentanucleotide. This unique structure within the anticodon domain may explain both lysyl- and/or glutamyl-tRNA synthetase recognition of cognate tRNAs and the observed behavior of tRNALys in codon reading. Using information from the study of tRNAs and model systems, a modified nucleoside-dependent interaction resulting in a novel covalently bonded, pseudo-circular RNA will be designed and synthesized. (ii). Determine if the metal-binding properties of modified uridines and adenosines contribute to tRNA's binding of Mg2+. tRNA's binding of Mg2+ is important to function. Amino acid modified uridines and adenosines bind metals and the localization of dihydrouridine (D) in Dloops and extra arms of tRNAs correlates with the appearance of the hydrophilic, metal-binding uridine, 3- 3-(S)-amino-3-carboxypropyl -uridine (acp3U). Preliminary data indicate that D is almost 100% 2'-endo and that it induces 2'-endo pucker in 3'-adjacent nucleosides. The combination of the D and TpsC domains of tRNA produces a high affinity Mg+ binding site. However, there is too little information to predict which structures constitute high affinity Mg2+ binding sites in RNA, in general, and tR NAs in particular. An understanding of metal chelation by amino acid modified nucleosides and the influence of D on local structure will aid in understanding the functional significance of metal binding. As part of this specific aim, a modified nucleoside-dependent, high affinity metal binding RNA will be designed and synthesized based on knowledge of the chemical and structural contributions of the modified nucleosides in this study.  Modified uridines and t6A will be introduced into small (3-6mers) and large (17-19mers) naturally-occurring sequences using manual and automated chemical syntheses. Sufficient quantities of oligomers will be produced to confirm, using ultraviolet and circular dichroism spectroscopy, preliminary evidence of the effects of metal ions and solution conditions on chemistry and structure. Interactions with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase will be assessed by analysis of enzyme activity and gel shifts. Functional interactions with the ribosome will be detected by inhibition of codon-dependent tRNA binding and chemical modification. Selected structures, analyzed by NMR, will be modeled with molecular dynamics refined, NMR derived distance and torsion angle constraints. Computer-assisted design will lead to the synthesis and analysis of novel modified uridine-containing, pseudo-circular and Mg2+ binding RNAs.  %%%  Encoded within DNA is genetic information for the production of proteins.  Transfer ribonucelic acids, tRNAs, decode this gentic information into the correct sequence of amino acids in each new protein.  tRNAs are composed of four nucleosides, adenosine, guanosine, cytidine anduridine, and minot amoounts of modifications of these four.  Modified uridines are of particular interest because they occur at positions in tRNA where they contribute to the correct reading and progress in translating the genetic code.  The project has two objectives.  Since modified uridines may affect tRNA structure, and thus tRNA's ability to decode, the decoding structures of tRNAs that have  the same modified uridin, but are responsible for bringing two different amino acids, glutamic acid and lysine, to the protein manufacturing unit, the ribosome, will be determined.  Modified uridines may bind metal ions, such as magnesium, and affect code-reading strucute and function.  The ability of glutamic acid and lysin tRNAs are responsible for unexplained biological observations in both bacterial and mammalian cells.  ***",
