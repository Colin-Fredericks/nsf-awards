 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop tools necessary for the molecular manipulation of diatoms and, potentially, other marine algae (e.g., green algae, brown algae and chrysophytes) that have commercial potential. The molecular biological manipulation of algal systems has seriously lagged behind other systems. Many of the techniques that have been developed for the introduction of DNA into bacterial, yeast, insect and animal cells have not been transferred to algal systems. Much of the reason for this has been a lack of sufficient funds for the study of algal systems. As diatoms (and other algae) that synthesize valuable molecules are discovered, it is crucial to establish sophisticated methods for their genetic manipulation, which in turn, will enable the development of economical production methods. In Phase I, the potential of each of the diatom target organisms chosen for this study will be evaluated by examining their susceptibility to antibiotics and herbicides. Potential marker and reporter genes (some of which will be isolated directly from diatoms) in diatom transformation will also be constructed and evaluated. Transformation protocols that have shown promise in other systems will be tested in transient expression systems and the best methods for transformation identified.  An attempt will also be made to use various marker genes for the stable transformation of economically promising diatoms. Phase I research should demonstrate if transformation is possible and set the stage for the use of molecular technology in the development of commercially important products from marine algae.       This research should lead to the establishment of methods for enhancing the production of specific products in marine algae. Martek is currently marketing two oils, one from an alga and the other from a fungus and has identified diatoms that produce oils of considerable value; markets for these oils would be in the fields of nutritional supplements and pharmaceuticals. However, the existing production costs for these oils are prohibitive. This study is to decrease the costs associated with their production.  Martek has also been trying to develop diatom cultures as inexpensive aquaculture feeds. The genetic manipulation of these algae to provide a better product (e.g., higher oil content, more balanced protein composition, antibiotic production) and/or to develop a less expensive method of production would lead to significant advances in the manufacture of higher quality and more cost-effective aquacultural feeds.",
