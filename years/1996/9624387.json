 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Stanton  DMS-9624387    Stanton will continue his investigation of spectral invariants    associated to elliptic differential operators in various settings of    homogeneous and locally symmetric spaces. In particular, he shall    examine a formula for the holomorphic torsion of a holomorphic vector    bundle over a locally symmetric space, obtained in earlier work, in    order to isolate in it the contribution from the R-class defined by    Bismut and Gillet-Soule. He will attempt to extend his earlier work    on locally symmetric spaces, in which he related torsion to special    values of geometric zeta functions, to a class of compact, Kaehler,    homogeneous spaces. For the class of quaternionic-Kaehler symmetric    and locally symmetric spaces he will seek a new spectral invariant,    and he will attempt to develop an associated geometric zeta function    to detect this invariant. In a different direction of research, he    will continue his investigation of various topological properties of    real flag manifolds using geometric representation theory.       Following upon the success of the index theorem in the 60's to    provide an analytic framework to compute topological invariants of    manifolds, beginning in the 1970's, spectral invariants were    associated to elliptic differential operators in an attempt to    formulate more subtle topological and geometric invariants of    manifolds in the language of analysis, i.e. differential equations,    on the manifold. The importance of these newer invariants is    underscored in their appearance in the emerging theory of the    fundamental forces by theoretical physicists. While these invariants    are difficult to compute for general spaces, for those spaces arising    from the action of a group, such as locally symmetric spaces, the    harmonic analysis coming from the well-developed theory of the    representations of the group provides a powerful tool to investigate    these invariants. The introduction of geometric zeta  functions serves    to connect in a not-yet-understood way the topology of the manifold,    via the fundamental group, to these invariants through the values of    the zeta function at distinguished points. The goal to understand    topological properties through differential equations then begins on    a formal level to make contact with number theory.",
