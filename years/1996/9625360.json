Investigating the chemical composition of comets is a  powerful way to gain insight into the different populations of  comets and the outer planetesimals.  This research project has  three main goals:  1) To investigate how the comae of comets,  whose formation are driven by Carbon Monoxide (CO)-ice  sublimation, differ from those whose formation is driven by  water-ice sublimation, 2) To search for chemical composition  differences between short-period comets and giant planetesimals,  which share a common origin in the Kuiper Disk in our Solar  system, and 3) To investigate the origin of cometary CO.    Carbon monoxide sublimation rates will be obtained by analyzing  millimeter/submillimeter-wavelength spectroscopy observations of  three comets experiencing C0-ice, but not water-ice, sublimation.  Observations of five comets, whose formation of their comae are  driven primarily by water-ice sublimation, will also be made.  These data from the observations will be used to test models of  CO-ice sublimation that occurs directly from the nucleus and to  probe variations between short-period comets and Kuiper Disk  objects.  Since CO may derive from photolysis of methanol and  formaldehyde, millimeter/submillmeter wavelength spectra of H2CO  and CH3OH abundances will be obtained for several productive  comets to search for correlations between CO and these candidate  precursor molecules.  Visible and near-IR wavelength imaging will  be performed on the comae in conjunction with spectroscopy to  test models of CO production from the dust and to monitor  cometary outbursts.    Pedagogical research indicates that students often learn much  more from collaborative learning, rather than from a solely  independent effort.   A group of 3-5 students will work together  as an observing team that will be responsible for implementing an  observing program of photometric imaging using a 16-inch  telescope, on the Erie, Pennsylvania campus, that is  equipped  with a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) detector.  The observing team  will have two goals: 1) To track comets over several months to  search for outburst activity and 2) To obtain simultaneous images  of a comet when millimeter/submillimeter wavelength spectroscopy  is being carried out at another telescope in another part of the  country.  ***",
