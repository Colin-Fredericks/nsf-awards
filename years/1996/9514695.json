This research  will explore the origins of human language, both evolutionarily  and in the developing child.  The focus will be on some of the  numerical concepts that play an important role in the grammars of  natural languages, i.e., quantifiers such as \"one, another,  some,\" the distinction between countable entities (such as  objects) and noncountable entities (such as sand and liquids),  and concepts of specific countable entities (such as bottles and  books).  The research will attempt to discover which of these  concepts are available before the emergence of language in the  developing child, which emerge as the infant learns their  expression in a natural language, and which are available  independently of language in primates, such as rhesus monkeys and  cottontop tamarins.    The method to be used to probe the conceptual capacity of  creatures without language is simply to show magic tricks,  essentially impossible events, and record when the creature  registers surprise by looking for a long time at the outcome of  such impossible events.  If a creature is surprised at the magic  trick, we can be confident that he or she conceptualized the  property of the natural world that was violated in the trick.   For example, earlier research has demonstrated that if infants  are shown one object placed behind a screen, and then a second  object, (i.e., 1 + 1), and then the screen is lowered, revealing  2 objects (the possible outcome), they show little interest.  But  if the screen is lowered revealing 3 objects or just 1 object,  they look reliably longer at these impossible outcomes.  This  method has been used for many years to study the concepts of  human babies, and recent research has demonstrated shown that it  also yields interpretable results both with rhesus monkeys in the  wild and with laboratory-housed cottontop tamarins.      ***",
