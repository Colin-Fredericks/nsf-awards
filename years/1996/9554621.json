 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) is holding a series  of regional workshops for mathematicians who teach statistics but  have little formal training in the subject.  These workshops  provide participants first-hand experiences of active learning  strategies by which undergraduates can investigate elements of  statistical thinking.  Follow-up activities will support the  workshop participants as they form a community, linked by  electronic mail, in which they share ideas about teaching  statistics.  These workshops will introduce participants to:  1)  the nature of statistical thinking, particularly concentrating on  how statistical concepts and methods differ from mathematical ones;  2) hands-on activities through which students can participate  actively in their discovery and understanding of statistical  concepts and properties; 3) assessment practices which go beyond  testing and grading to establish a dialogue between students and  instructor that leads to both improved teaching and a more  authentic assessment of students' understanding of statistics and  data analysis; 4) technology not simply as a tool for analyzing  data but also as a vehicle for active learning and as a resource  for acquiring teaching materials.",
