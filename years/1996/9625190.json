 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smereka       The investigator undertakes a program of research and  education under a Career grant.  Efforts are directed toward the  study of bubbly fluids.  A goal is to develop effective equations  for such fluids.  The first step is to derive the equations of  motion for a finite collection of interacting bubbles.  The  behavior for an infinite number of bubbles is deduced from kinetic  theory, which gives rise to a kinetic equation that is a  coarse-grained description of the mixture.  This procedure has been  implemented to derive two sets of effective equations that  describe concentration and sound waves in an ideal bubbly flow.  In both situations it is observed that the spatially homogeneous  solution may be unstable.  In the first case the instability  results in the bubbles clustering and in the later case it  indicates the bubble oscillations will synchronize to each other.  A damping mechanism similar to Landau damping is found in the  stable case.  This is connected to the spectral theory of linear  operators with a continuous spectrum and has no finite-dimensional  analogue.  The investigator extends this work to investigate the  interaction of acoustic modes with convective modes.  The theory  will also be broadened to include the effects of gravity, liquid  viscosity and bubble size distribution.  With a view towards a more  general theory of bubbly flow, the investigator examines the  effects of a small, slowing varying vorticity field on an ideal  bubbly flow.  It is anticipated that the studies will be performed  in collaboration with a graduate student.  In addition to its  relevance to engineering problems, this project contains  substantial educational aspects.  The student will be exposed to  fluid mechanics, potential theory, Hamiltonian mechanics, kinetic  theory, spectral theory of linear operators, and numerical  methods.  A new graduate level mathematics class is also developed  on the numerical solution of interface problems with level sets.  The advantage of this  approach is that it handles topology changes  naturally and easily.  This class is expected to attract not only  mathematics students but science and engineering students as well,  because interface problems have wide-spread interest.       An important emphasis of this project is to further enhance  the applied mathematics program in the mathematics department at  the University of Michigan and promote education at the interface  between mathematics and engineering.  One aspect of this project is  to develop effective equations for bubbly fluids.  A bubbly fluid  is a dispersion of gas bubbles in a liquid and can be found in a  variety natural and industrial settings.  The effective equations  will give a bulk or coarse-grained description of this mixture.  At  the present time computer resources do not exist to numerically  simulate directly a bubbly fluid.  For this reason considerable  effort has been made in the development of models for bubbly  fluids.  The other aspect of the project is to incorporate  applications of mathematics in a significant portion of  mathematics classes.  At the undergraduate level, the investigator  plans to develop an enriched calculus course that focuses on  applications for engineering students.  The investigator plans to  continue redesigning a senior level partial differential equations  class to include more physics, applications, and computer-related  assignments.",
