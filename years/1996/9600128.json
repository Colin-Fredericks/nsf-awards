 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9600128  McLaughlin    The proposer continues his research in the theory and application of  nonlinear dispersive waves, in the specific areas of chaotic nonlinear  waves, waves which occur in the interaction of the atmosphere with the  ocean, and topics in liquid crystal nonlinear optics.  His work on the  mathematical theory of chaotic nonlinear waves will focus upon the  persistence and consequences of homoclinic orbits for partial differ-  ential equations.  In the project he develops geometric singular  perturbation methods for partial differential equations, including  including invariant manifold fibrations and normal forms.  He then  combines these methods from dynamical systems theory with Melnikov  analysis to prove the persistence of homoclinic orbits.  Consequences  of these orbits for  nonlinear wave systems are then investigated  numerically.  Such modern methods in the mathematical theory of  nonlinear dispersive waves are  applied to topics in atmosphere ocean  physics and  to nonlinear optics.  %%%  Atmosphere ocean interactions and laser propagation in  nonlinear optics  are two of the  most natural areas in science for the occurence of  nonlinear dispersive waves.  The proposer will develop modern mathe-  matical theory of these waves, and apply it to these areas of science.  Chaotic and irregular behavior, which occurs in the temporal evolution of  these nonlinear wave systems, is just becoming understood mathematically.  The proposer will study the effects of such nonlinear and irregular  behavior on oscillations  of the sea surface temperature, on the  prediction and evolution of storm tracks, and on the propagation of laser  light through liquid crystal materials.  Methods for this scientific  study include mathematical theory, formal perturbation theory, and  scientific computation.    ***",
