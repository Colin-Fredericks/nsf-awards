 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the research is the investigation of architectural  features for cost-effective, mainstream computing based on multithreading.  In  this vein, this research will focus in two directions; investigation of  multithreaded dataflow paradigm, and the adaptation of the results to hybrid  dataflow-von Neumann architecture.  The dataflow model is ideally suited for  multithreaded architecture since it facilitates instruction level context  switching and fine-grained parallelism.  A clear understanding of the issues in  supporting multiple threads in dataflow environment will permit us to adapt them  to hybrid dataflow/control flow architectures.  Hybrid systems present the most  interesting opportunities in the area of multiprocessing - they directly address  problems that will be faced by future superscalar processors, such as long memory  latencies, context switching overheads, multiple active instruction streams, fast  and efficient support for task synchronization.    Initially, this project will investigate the use of cache memories for  multihreaded dataflow architecture, and compiler techniques for improving the  performance of such machines.  This project will then study architectural support  for multithreading including support for thread management, thread scheduling,  communication and synchronization among threads.  Simultaneous multithreading in  the context of dataflow and hybrid architectures will then be investigated.   Finally, this project will explore the suitability of the most significant  architectural features for use with convectional RISC technology.",
