 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation of six American scientists in a U.S.-Turkish binational workshop on `Description Models of Engineering Design` to be held at the Faculty of Architecture of Istanbul Technical University, in Istanbul, Turkey in the Fall of 1996.  This project brings together a number of experts from the U.S. and from Turkey, as well as a number of experts from few other countries.   The purpose is to encourage inter-disciplinary interaction and collaboration between researchers interested in describing engineering design for a variety of purposes, including : understanding, prediction, explanation, formal modeling, simulation, decision support, design assistance, and automation.  Formal methods and tool development in the area of engineering and building design have had limited success.  For example, computer assisted building design (CABD) has made little impact in the design delivery process or the actual performance of building or similar structures.  Recently there has been an increase in the attention paid to understanding how humans design and how they use tools-especially electronic ones- while they design.   Efforts in this area are carried out by the NSF supported Engineering Design Research Center, at Carnegie Mellon University, to develop design tools and understand their use, to improve performance in industry.   Scope:  This project supports a new idea for a workshop dealing with design as multidisciplinary endeavor applicable to many engineering fields such as in structures, machines, and other engineering  systems.  The workshop will serve as a medium for interdisciplinary exchange of findings and ideas between international participants who will be distributed between several key disciplines such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, building engineering, and architecture.  The meeting will produce publications including pre-proceedings, and selected publications in the international journal of Design Studies, and later in an edited book.  The meeting also is to forge a plan of cooperation among participating individuals and institutions.  The cooperation will target key concepts: practice, tool, inter-disciplinary transfer, productivity and creativity.  This project allows a U.S. team of eminent scientists to work in an international setting with foreign colleagues to stimulate this important area of improvement in design.  The project meets the objectives of the Division of International Programs (INT).  The Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems and INT are jointly funding this project.",
