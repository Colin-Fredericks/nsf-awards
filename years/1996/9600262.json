Dr. Becker will work  with Dr. Chie Sano, senior researcher in the Conservation  Science Department ast the Institute, on a research project  entitled, \"The Use of Pyrolysis Gas Chromatography Mass  Spectrometry for Assessing the State of the Preservation of  Proteinaceous Materials\".    The proposed research will develop analytical techniques  sensitive to chemical alterations prior to their  manifestation as physical changes in museum objects.  A gas  chromatograph (GC) interfaced with a mass spectrometry (MS)  and combined with an initial pyrolysis (Py) step will be  used to reveal the concentrations and number of pyrolysis  products of Nylon 6,6 change as a function of heat  treatment.  Since soluble fragments with a distribution of  molecular weights are formed as silk deteriorates, it is  anticipated that this technique (Py-GC-MS) will be useful in  monitoring the chemical alterations as a function of aging.  Ascertaining the complex nature of  natural degradation and  that which occurs during pyrolysis, the research will  examine if changes in the fragmentation patterns of  naturally degraded proteins in silk can indicate the state  of preservation.  A systematic study of aged silks could not  only supply information on the state of preservation of silk  but will also determine the usefulness of this technique as  a strategy for routine analysis of proteinaceous materials  found in cultural property objects.  ***",
