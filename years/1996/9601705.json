 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction  For the ten research projects described  here,  the  role   of  NMR  spectroscopy  ranges  from  an  extremely  useful  complement  to other spectroscopic and biochemical approaches  to  being the sine qua non for accomplishment of the project specific  aims.   In   each  case,  however,  a  sophisticated,  sensitive,  high-field  spectrometer is essential for the NMR  components  of  the project. Such equipment is not available at the University of  Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and this situation has led either to an  interruption of on-going projects, to acquisition of  data  on  a  limited  scale  elsewhere, or to an external collaboration  as  a  default.  This  is  clearly unacceptable for a major  Research  I  university  such  as  UIC  and must be  urgently  remedied.  This  proposal  for  a  new  500MHz NMR spectrometer  to  be  used  for  solution  structural  studies on proteins, peptides  and  complex  natural  products therefore represents part of a broader plan  to  address  the  major deficits in NMR spectroscopic  facilities  at  UIC. The second part of the plan, to be dealt with separately, is  to  acquire  additional NMR instrumentation  equally-focussed  to  satisfy   the  needs  of  solids  researchers.  This  two-pronged  strategy was partly prompted by very sensible reviewers' comments  on  an  earlier  unsuccessful proposal to NSF-ARI  for  a  600MHz  spectrometer.  That  single  instrument  proposal  attempted   to  satisfy  both solids and bio-macromolecule researchers. We  think  that  the present bipartite, focussed-use strategy is both a more  cost effective and efficient one. Proposed Instrumentation We are  requesting  50% matching funds for the purchase of a narrow  bore  500MHz NMR spectrometer optimized for solution structural studies  on   low   concentrations  of  bio-macromolecules   and   complex  plant-derived natural products. The spectrometer will consist of:  1.  Basic  two-RF  channel  (with lock) 500MHz  spectrometer  and    standard  bore ( 52mm) superconducting magnet with host computer    and  software,  temperature control unit and vibration  damping    unit. 2. Additional two RF channels and 2H-decoupling hardware.    3.  5mm pulsed field gradient inverse triple resonance (13C and    l5N) and inverse broadband       (15N to 31P) probes. 5mm 19F-lH dual probe.  4. Additional temperature stabilization unit to give control of  better than 0.1 C.  Price  quotes  have  been received from the  two  major  vendors,  Bruker  and  Varian. Although a detailed budget has been  written  for  Bruker  (p  31),  the  choice of instrument  will  be  based  principally  on  comparative performance, in  addition  to  other  considerations  such as cost and future technical  and  equipment  support. All available instruments will be evaluated.  Research  and  Training  to  be  Conducted  The  research  to  be  conducted  all  relates  to NMR solution  structural  studies  on  biomolecules.  The  studies fall into two  main  categories.  (i)  Structure elucidation of medium sized proteins, protein  domains,  and their complexes with DNA, with other protein domains and with  peptide or polysaccharide ligands. Such studies benefit from  the  highestfield,   most   sensitive   and   experimentally-versatile  spectrometer  available.  (ii)  Structure  elucidation  of  novel  complex  plant-derived  natural  products,  which  requires   the  sensitivity  of a 500MHz spectrometer and the versatility  of  an  instrument with up-to-date multi-channel pulse capabilities.        Both  graduate  students and postdoctoral fellows  will  be  trained  in the theory and application of modern NMR spectroscopy  by   the  core  of  six  investigators  with  expertise  in   NMR  spectroscopic  methods.  A  joint bi-weekly  NMR  users  research  meeting  is  planned as a forum for dissemination of new  methods  and critical evaluation of acquired results.  Activity  resulting from funding State-of-the-art high field  NMR  instrumentation  will  have a profound  and   positive  effect  on  structural  research  on campus. In addition  to  permitting  the  successful   completion  of  on-going  projects  it  will   allow  researchers who must now go elsewhere to carry out their  studies  on  campus.  This in turn will increase the local  visibility  of  structurally-oriented research and help both  in  recruitment  of  structurally-oriented  faculty, postdocs  and  students,  and  in  fostering collaborations between faculty within the university.",
