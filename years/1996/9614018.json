 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Senkan  9614018    The PI proposes to continue and extend his ongoing research program to include the investigation of trace by-products produced in the combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbons.  He points out the need to better understand the formation and fate of trace aromatic by-products formed in incineration processes in order to safely utilize this important technology.  In the experimental program, both premixed laminar flat flames and counter-flow jet diffusion flames of CH2Cl2, CHCl3, and CCl4 in mixtures with CH4  will be studied over a wide range of gas compositions, temperatures, and equivalence ratios characteristic of the operating conditions of incinerators (including failure modes).  In the case of the counter-flow jet diffusion flame experiments, the effects of gas composition and strain rate on the formation of trace aromatics will also be investigated.  The PI will make use of his previously developed diagnostic techniques in order to measure and characterize the trace halogenated aromatics and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) produced.  These techniques will include hot micro-probe sampling using high resolution gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), and laser photoionization (LP) time of flight mass spectroscopy (REMPI/MS).  One primary focus of these experiments will be to further investigate the effects of the presence of soot on the levels of PAC formed in these flames.      A theoretical/analytical effort will also be pursued in which the development of detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms (DCKMs) as well as reduced chemical mechanisms describing the formation and destruction of the trace by-products will be undertaken.  These mechanistic results will be combined with appropriate flame models for comparison with measurements.  Dr. Sidney Benson of the University of Southern California and Dr. Carl Melius of the Sandia National laboratory will collaborate in the theoretical effort.  ***",
