 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625762  Hennage    This is a request for a grant towards defraying the cost of attendance at  the OSA/IEEE Integrated Photonics Research Conference (IPR) for selected  American students who would otherwise be unable to come to the meeting. It  is expected that participation will significantly advance the educational  and research impact of the conference.    A very important aspect of IPR is its unique role in education and training  in the field of guided-wave optoelectronics. The conference presents  students and researchers with the latest ideas and results, and provides a  forum for discussion and sharing contributions with colleagues as well as  leading scientists. The purpose of the grant we propose here is therefore  to help sustain the participation of graduate students in the meeting.    At present large conferences such as the LEOS Annual, OFC, OSA Annual, CLEO  and SPIE meetings are increasingly soliciting integrated optics papers.  Unfortunately, relatively few researchers are able to attend all these  forums, while yearly attendance at IPR has remained relatively constant at  200-250 attendees with 15-20 % being students. This has led to some  dissatisfaction among many members of the integrated optics community.    To reverse this trend by strengthening the educational and research content  of IPR, the conference this year has undergone several major changes.  First, the technical program committee has been expanded from 44 to 59  members. Many of the new members were added to help organize eight  semi-autonomous symposia on key emerging areas in guided-wave optics  ranging from Silicon Photonics and Parallel Optical Interconnects to  Optical System Modeling and Integrated Optics and Micromachining. In future  years, the more successful symposia will hopefully develop into permanent  sub-units of the conference and additional symposia will be established as  warranted. Since symposia papers undergo the same careful review process as  normal contributed papers, we hope in this mann er to combine the  flexibility of a small topical meeting format with the high scientific  standards normally associated with large professional meetings.    At the same time, IPR will continue to offer a full program of regular  submitted papers in its core areas - numerical simulation and design,  active semiconductor devices, dielectric waveguides and waveguide devices  and photonic component manufacturing and packaging technology. These  sessions traditionally have attracted many of the top international  scientists in the guided-wave optics field from a wide cross-section of  organizational backgrounds. Indeed, the geographic distribution of  registrants for IPR'95 was - North/South America: 54%, Europe: 25%, and  Pacific Rim: 60%.  ***",
