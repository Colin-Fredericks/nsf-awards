A  comprehensive  and  creative  program  for  mentoring   recently-  appointed  junior  faculty  at  research  universities  will   be  established.   The  format  is  to  bring  promising  and   newly  appointed faculty members into sustained contact over a  one-year  period with seasoned researchers from several universities.   The  effort will be organized around a faculty panel consisting of six  persons   with  strong  research  and  publication   records   in  economics, geography, planning, political science, psychology and  sociology.  The panel will engage in mentoring 12 junior  faculty  who  will  be  competitively selected as  fellows.  The  two-year  program will involve detailed planning, a set of workshops,  one-  on-one mentoring, and research and writing activities.  ***",
