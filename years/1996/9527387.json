 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527387  Zeng  Coal processing waste dams are used to store coal slurry, and as  such have many characteristics in common with a broader class of  structures known as tailings dams. Tailings dams are  characterized by hydraulically placed fills held in place by an  embankment. Failure of tailings dams due to earthquakes has  occurred many times in the past, causing significant loss of  property and human lives as well as severe environmental  problems. Despite the damage caused by such failures, there has  been little research conducted to evaluate the stability of such  structures under earthquake loading. Coal waste is a fine grained  material which is sensitive to cyclic loading. High excess pore  pressure, and in the worst scenario liquefaction of the tailings,  can cause large pressure on the supporting embankment and  initiate catastrophic failure.    This project uses a geotechnical centrifuge modeling technique to  study the mechanism of failure of coal-waste tailings dams and to  generate physical data for the evaluation of current design  procedures.    The project involves:  1. Two centrifuge tests on tailings dams constructed according to  two different construction methods currently used in practice  2. Comparison between the data from centrifuge tests with the  results obtained from numerical simulation    The results of this study will provide engineers with valuable  information concerning the stability of existing tailings dams  and guidelines for improvement of future designs.
