 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625892  Lederman    The considerable recent interest in magnetic thin films and  superlattices has been fueled in large part by the potential  technological applications of giant magnetoresistance (GMR),  exchange anisotropy (EA), and perpendicular anisotropies in  metallic ferromagnets.  However, numerous topics of interest  in this field have not been fully explored, including the  magnetic interactions in superlattices composed of  alternating  metallic and insulating layers, and purely  insulating magnetic superlattices.  These types of  superlattices could further our basic understanding of  magnetic interactions and lead to unexpected technologies.  The molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system sponsored by this  award is designed to grow and characterize a wide variety of  magnetic superlattices, including those composed only of  insulators, only of metals, or combinations of insulators  and metals.  %%%  Characterizing the structure of these materials is important  because the surface and interface structure in magnetic thin  films and superlattices can significantly affect their  physical properties.  In order to understand these  properties, it is crucial to study the surface of these  materials as a function of growth parameters, such as film  thickness, growth temperature, and growth rate.  Structural  studies can also aid in distinguishing the structural  effects from the intrinsic superlattice and interface  effects.  This can be done in-situ using surface-sensitive  techniques such as reflection high energy electron  diffraction (RHEED), low energy electron diffraction (LEED),  scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and x-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy (XPS) without contamination from the air.  This  information will be complemented with ex-situ x-ray  diffraction measurements.  ***",
