 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626639  Levine       Daniel Ruberman will continue to investigate applications of gauge   theory to the topology of four-manifolds. One application is to use   Seiberg-Witten equations to describe bounds on the genus of a surface   representing a homology class of negative self-intersection.  A second is   to use the Seiberg-Witten invariants to give an obstruction to isotopy of  diffeomorphisms of certain reducible four-manifolds.  Other projects   involve a computation of Casson's invariant in terms of the Yang-Mills   moduli space, and joint work with Z. Bizacka on ends of smooth 4-manifolds.  Kiyoshi Igusa will study the relationship between the higher Reidemeister   torsion invariants (algebraic K-theory invariants associated to the   diffeomorphism space of a smooth manifold) and analytically defined   invariants such as the Kontsevich integral and the Lott-Bismut analytic   torsion.  Using his complexified version of Bokstedt's theorem, he plans to  relate the topology of circular and planar oriented graphs to algebraic   K-theory.  The methods to be used are Morse theory, algebraic K-theory and   cyclic homology.  Jerome Levine will continue his joint study, with   S. Garoufalidis, of finite-type invariants of homology 3-spheres, in   particular, their relationship with filtrations of various subgroups of the   mapping class group of a surface.  He will continue to study the Morse theory   of harmonic 1-forms, in particular, the question: for every closed Morse   1-form, is there a harmonic 1-form with the same critical points and in the   same cohomology class?  The next case to consider is when the associated   foliation has all compact leaves.  He will also continue to study invariants   of manifolds arising from previous work on jumps of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer   eta-invariant and return to questions about link concordance.  Edgar Brown   will attempt to extend his previous work on rational homotopy theory to the   mod-p setting, in particular, the construction of a minimal model f or   function spaces.  He also plans to study the Steenrod operations in an   algebraic setting and the construction of minimal models.       To put it less technically, Daniel Ruberman's project is concerned with   properties of four-dimensional spaces called manifolds.  Among the questions   under study are the existence and geometrical properties of two-dimensional   surfaces sitting inside a four-dimensional manifold.  Ruberman will also   investigate symmetries of four-dimensional spaces in order to determine when   a pair of symmetries can be joined by a one-parameter family of symmetries.    The approach to these investigations is via the Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten   equations of mathematical physics, which arise in studies of the fundamental   particles.  There are several formulas coming from various branches of   mathematics and physics that are known to represent the same geometric   phenomena that are manifested in many ways, ranging from the circles and   lines in the plane to the equations of gravity.  Using his knowledge of these   methods, Kiyoshi Igusa will be investigating the relationship between these   formulas.  Jerome Levine will be working to determine those invariants of   3-dimensional manifolds that are computable in a very explicit sense and that   seem to be closely related to invariants coming from quantum field theory.  Edgar Brown will be studying various algebraic models of spaces that   capture many of their properties but are easier to manipulate and understand.  ***",
