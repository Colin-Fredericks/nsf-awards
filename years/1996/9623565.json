 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623565  Wray      Animals vary widely in their ability to regenerate missing body parts or to reproduce asexually.  Some species, such as annelid worms, flatworms, and sea anemones have remarkable powers of regeneration.  For example, certain annelid worms are able to regenerate a new functional adult body from only a single segment. The primary goal of this study is to characterize the involvement of two key developmental genes (engrailed and hunchback) in regeneration, asexual budding, and embryonic development in several annelid worms.   Key developmental genes, such as homeobox genes, are known to play important roles in many aspects of embryo development, such as the formation of the anterior/posterior axis, nervous system development, head formation, and limb formation.  These genes are also expected to be involved in the development of new tissue during processes such as regeneration and asexual reproduction.  However, little is currently known about the action of these genes during such processes. In the research funded by this award, genes will be cloned and their expression studied during all three processes.  Characterization of expression patterns during regeneration and budding will help elucidate the functions of the genes and show to what extent these genes perform the same role in the different processes.  This research will shed new light on the genetical basis of developmental processes underlying morphological diversification in animals.  Research on the genetical controls of developmental processes also can contribute to an understanding of developmental abnormalities and their treatment in higher organisms.",
