 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical need for an electronic particle counter is identified  and funds are requested to purchase a Multisizer lle electronic  particle counter made by Coulter Corporation. The particle counter will  be used (1 ) to study the feeding ecology of larval mosquitoes and the  relationship of feeding rates and particle selection to trophic state  of larval developmental sites; (2) to study natural selection,  population genetics, and plant reproductive ecology by quantifying  traits such as pollen production, the amount of pollen removed by  pollinators and pollination success, and by examining variation and  environmental influences on the male component of plant reproductive  success; (3) to determine the selection of different particle types by  mosquito larvae and the impact of behavioral changes in feeding ecology  (which cause resistance to ingestible toxins) on particle selection.  feeding rates and, eventually, on the life histories of resistant vs  susceptible strains of Culex mosquitoes; (4) to measure particle size  distributions and abundance in mosquito developmental sites; and (5) to  quantify and size occluded bacculoviruses. In addition to fulfilling  the needs of the major and minor users, a particle counter will foster  collaborations with colleagues at University of California - Riverside  (UCR) and other institutions, meet the needs of postdoctoral scientists  and graduate students working in our laboratories, and enhance the  education of undergraduate and graduate students at UCR. The particle  counter will be used by investigators applying diverse methodologies to  a wide range of particle size. Therefore, funds are requested to  purchase four additional aperatures. Funds are also requested to  purchase software designed for the Multisizer lle, a free-standing  IBM-compatible computer and a printer. As compared to comparably priced  electronic particle counters, the advantages of the Multisizer lle  system include ease of operation, a greater dynamic range of particle   size, features that significantly enhance user safety, flexible and  user-friendly software, features that reduce electronic interference  from outside sources. and superior user-support services.",
