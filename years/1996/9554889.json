 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Distance and Service-Learning Project at Virginia Tech  is a partnership between the University's Physics Department  and science programs at high schools throughout Southwest  Virginia.  The Project targets two related problems:  the  geographic and professional isolation of rural high schools  and teachers that limits their access to the facilities,  resources and research discoveries of major universities,  and the academic isolation of advanced  undergraduate and  graduate science students who have little or no opportunity  to communicate with populations outside of their highly  specialized scientific field.  The Project design addresses  these problems by employing distance learning to stimulate  high school students' interest in and appreciation of rapid  developments in the fields of physics  and astronomy; and  service-learning to engage selected physics students in the  delivery of this information through ongoing electronic and  face-to-face interactions.  The Project will be piloted with  Floyd County High School.  It is expected that the Distance  and Service-Learning Project will increase the level of  science literacy among the general population of students at  Floyd County High School, lead to the creation of an  Advanced Placement Physics course, improve the oral, written  and electronic communication skills of physics majors at  Virginia Tech, and introduce physics majors to new  applications of their discipline, including careers in  teaching.  All phases of the Project Pilot will be carefully  documented, leading to the production of a teaching guide  for School-College Collaborations using Distance and Service-  Learning techniques.",
