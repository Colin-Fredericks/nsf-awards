 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623777  Richardson    The theme of the proposed work is to examine the consequences of  the very large amplitude quantum motion in solid helium. The  first objective is to observe and measure the rates of exchange  of 3He atoms in three, four, and six particle rings. According to  theory, the ring-like exchange motion is responsible for the  unique nuclear magnetic ordering in solid 3He. The ring exchange  motion has never been directly observed. Special nmr techniques  will have to be developed for the observation. A further  objective of the work is an attempt to see new modes of atomic  motion by using Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Several unusual and  important phenomena have been predicted but have never been  observed.  %%%  The researchers will use nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to  study a remarkably interesting material, solid helium. Because  helium has such a very light mass, its atomic motion is quite  large even near absolute zero temperature. Modern magnetic  resonance techniques will be used to study the nature and  consequences of that motion. For example, the zero temperature  state of solid helium has been predicted to have the atoms moving  rapidly in ring like rotations, rather than sitting quietly at  fixed crystalline lattice points.  ***",
