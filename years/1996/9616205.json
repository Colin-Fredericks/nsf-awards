 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616205  Desharnais       A central question in population biology is that of  understanding and explaining observed fluctuations in animal  numbers.  The study of nonlinear dynamics has opened the way to a  new phase of population research in which experiments are focused  directly on phenomena such as equilibria, periodic and aperiodic  cycles, and chaos.  The investigators undertake a spectrum of  activities essential to the testing of nonlinear population  theory: from the translation of biology into the formal language  of mathematics, to the analysis of mathematical models, to the  development and application of statistical techniques for the  analysis of data, to the design and implementation of biological  experiments.  Laboratory populations of flour beetles of the genus  Tribolium are used in the experiments.  By means of their studies  the investigators provide rigorous experimental tests of  nonlinear population phenomena and behavior.  These include: (1)  dynamical transitions from stable equilibria, to invariant loops  (aperiodicities), to period locking, to strange attractors and  chaos; (2) transient and intermittent dynamics with aims towards  defining practical concepts of intermittency for use with  stochastic population models and the testing of some of the  unusual transient behaviors forecast by stochastic nonlinear  models; (3) the dynamics of meta-populations using beetle  populations linked by migration; and (4) the dynamical behaviors  that can be produced by the interaction of environmental  periodicities with nonlinear demographic effects.       The investigators study how biological populations (in  particular, populations of insects) fluctuate in time and how  different circumstances can lead to drastically different, and  sometimes unexpected, changes in these fluctuations.  This study  is carried out by means of an interdisciplinary program that  integrates the use of sophisticated mathematical models and  statistical analysis with the design and implementation of   laboratory experiments using species of beetles that are  economically important insect pests.  The investigators seek to  describe and explain a variety of patterns in population  fluctuations, ranging from those that are regular and predictable  to those that are irregular and \"chaotic.\" They seek to  understand the environmental conditions that give rise to these  various kinds of population behavior.  This understanding is  essential if the impact on biological populations of  environmental perturbations and manipulations (by Man or by  Nature) is to be predicted.  These impacts have far-reaching  consequences, ranging from food production and pest control to  wildlife management and the conservation of species diversity.",
