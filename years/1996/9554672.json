 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is building on BMCC's successful NSF Undergraduate  Faculty Enhancement program.  The project is providing summer  workshops for mathematics faculty which emphasize students working  in groups and use of computer graphers and computer algebra systems  to create written honors projects and animated calculus movies. The  student population at BMCC is two-thirds women, and eighty-five  percent African-American and Latino.  With support from NSF, DOE,  and MSIP, they have been highly successful in attracting and  retaining increased numbers of women and minority students into our  Precalculus, Calculus, and Differential Equations sequence.  The  new workshops are adding new techniques in technology and  collaborative learning to the workshops which includes science  projects developed through their NSF-CCD grant, CD-ROM technology,  and two 1-day academic year workshops each year. Physics and  chemistry faculty are attending the workshops as well as  mathematics faculty.  The project is sharing what is learned and  developed with other faculty in the region by instituting two  regional summer faculty workshops for each of two summers.  One  workshop is for faculty inexperienced in technology on the  preparation of collaborative computer portfolios in Science and the  Calculus sequence.  The second workshop is for faculty more  experienced in technology.  Two 1-day academic year workshops each  year are for follow-up activities.",
