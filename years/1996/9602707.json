 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Florida is a land grant university with a student enrollment of more than 40,000, and is the largest university in the Nation's fourth most populous state.  It is a diverse institution with a primary obligation to educate future scientists. Research and graduate education in the Department of Geology are integrated activities,  and research is the critical component that provides the venue in which future professional geologists are trained. Turlington Hall is currently home to the Department where research performed is categorized in four primary areas: Paleo-environmental  studies; Chemical Geodynamics, Geomagnetism, and Environmental geology.  Investigations in these areas represent multidisciplinary efforts of faculty from Geology, Chemistry, Biology, Agriculture, and the Florida Museum of Natural History. The basis for collaboration is not only mutual scientific interests, but the need for high quality analytical data. Turlington Hall in its existing condition cannot support or  accommodate the growth of the research program.  Space, originally not designed for research, has been encroached upon for research purposes. A window of opportunity has been offered to the Department to relocate and consolidate programs in Williamson Hall, formerly the home of the Physics Department.  However, the 1953 structure requires major renovation in order to house the Geology program.  The NSF will participate with the University of Florida in renovating a portion of Williamson Hall by converting former physics research space to geology research space.  Specific renovations will consist of: replacing electrical, HVAC, plumbing, and mechanical systems, upgrading fire protection systems, installing fixed equipment, and removing asbestos containing materials.  Renovations to the building will ensure that  safety, health, and ADA standards are met. Development of the research infrastructure will  increase research capabilities needed to accommodate more affiliate faculty.  Since women and minorities are an under-represented group within the geosciences, it is anticipated that scientists and students will be attracted to the discipline.  Consequently, the Department will be able to extend relations with the private sector, and provide graduates who will be versatile and well-trained members of the nation's scientific and technical workforce.",
