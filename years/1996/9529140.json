 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529140  SEERING       This award establishes a new Engineering Research Center, the  Center for Competitive Product Development at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology.  The award initiates a potential 11-year  life span with a new five-year cooperative agreement, renewable in  the third and sixth years of the center's operation.       The vision of the Center is to develop methods, procedures,  and software tools to improve the product development process.  The  product development process is the critical industrial procedure  for bringing new and innovative products to market.  The challenge  is to improve methods to guide the complexity of product  development.  The process is performed by teams from an array of  organizational units, with participants having a diversity of  skills and perspectives.  From the perspective of the marketplace  and engineering, this vision is very important.  The success or  failure of products into the marketplace depends on the details of  how engineers translate their understanding of customer needs and  desires and business practices into product specifications.       To provide a systems perspective, the research on the product  development process is organized into three thrusts:  (1)  customer/engineering interface, (2) product family strategy, and  (3) organization of the product development process.  The research  output of the joint industry/engineering/business teams will take  the practical form of improved product development methods,  techniques, and tools.  These will be developed from research on  challenging problems faced by their industrial partners.       In education, the Center will create a new educational  experience for MIT undergraduate and graduate students, first-hand  involvement in the product development.  In addition, the Center  intends to curricular material to improve the training of  engineering and management students for industry in order to  produce a new generation of engineers and managers, skilled  efficient and co mmercially successful product development and  design.  The ERC will help develop a major in product development  for the MBA degree offered by the Sloan School of Management.  In  addition, the Center will help develop a new professional  engineering degree in product development, which the Engineering  School will offer.  The ERC will collaborate with industrial  partners in offering courses for product development processes for  their on-site training programs.       In outreach, the Center will provide biennial conferences for  faculty in U.S. engineering and business schools interested in  product development.  The ERC also will introduce the principles  and excitement of competition to minority high school students  through the MIT Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science  Program.  Professor Woodie Flowers, a member of the ERC, will  create an alliance for the ERC with U.S.  First, a nonprofit  organization.         This ERC is an interdisciplinary partnership between the MIT's  School of Engineering and the Sloan School of Management.  Dr.  Warren Seering, a Professor of Mechanical Engineering will be the  Director of the Center.  Dr. John Hauser, a Professor of Marketing  in the Sloan School of Management, will serve as Associate  Director.  The research team is multidisciplinary, with strong  collaboration between faculty in MIT's engineering and business  schools.       The strong support of MIT for the Center is demonstrated by  active cooperation among deans and faculties of the engineering and  management schools.  Product development is a central core of MIT's  strategy for the continued improvement of engineering and business  education.  MIT will construct a new facility to house a state-of-  the-art prototyping facility for product development process  research.  ***",
