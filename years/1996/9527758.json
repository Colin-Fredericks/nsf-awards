 "awd_abstract_narration": "9527758  LYDEARD   Neotropical cichlids are a group of fascinating freshwater fishes that have long attracted the attention of professional biologists and hobbyists alike.  Neotropical cichlids are found from the Rio Grande in Texas to southern South America.  Cichlids have evolved into a variety of shapes and sizes that are ecoloeically similar to North America's largemouth bass, bluegill, and rapid water-loving, bottom-dwelling fish called darters.  Cichlids are unique among fish in that they build nests, care for their young, and defend territories.  These features have also made cichlids popular with aquarium hobbyists; familiar aquarium varieties include the Jack Dempsey, firemouth, Aztec, oscar, angelfish, and discus.  Unfortunately, despite the widespread appeal of Neotropical cichlids, we still know very little about the relationships among these species.   The primary objective of this research is to examine the relationships of Neotropical cichlids using DNA sequencing technology.  By actually sequencing portions of several genes from representatives of Neotropical cichlid species, we expect to construct a tree depicting their relationships to one another.  Understanding the relationships of Neotropical cichlids will enable biologists to learn how the various morphological varieties evolved and provide an important framework for future ecological and behavioral studies.  In addition, our work may provide useful information for improving cichlid stocks for the aquarium trade.",
