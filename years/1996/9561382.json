 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses problems associated with current microelectronics lithography systems which utilize masking technology.  These problems include: the need for multiple masks required for subsequent layers of an electronic module; the difficulties associated with generating large-area masks; and the dependence on foreign suppliers for mask substrates.  The only available technology which does not require masks is laser direct-write imaging, which is inherently slow due to it's bit-by-bit, serial mode of addressing.  Phase I develop a maskless, large-area, high-throughput, high-resolution, lithography system which combines a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) with an established patterning technology.  The DMD is a micro-mechanical, spatial light modulator with high parallel-processing power and replaces the conventional mask without any loss in throughput.  When used in conjunction with a seamless scanning technology, it can generate any possible pattern with hiqh resolution over an unlimited area.       This technology is expected to meet a critical need in the microelectronics manufacturing industry and also significantly increase U.S. competitiveness in an enabling technology area.",
