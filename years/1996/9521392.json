 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521392  Williams    The phenomena of nucleation and growth of metals and metalloid islands  (Ni,  Ag, In, Sn, Sb, and Te), on semiconductor surfaces (Si) will  be  investigated.  Techniques of Time-of Flight Low Energy Ion  Scattering  will  be  used  to measure the coverage of the surface islands  during  material  deposition to obtain kinetic information. Scanning Tunneling  Microscopy (STM) will provide spatial information such as shape,  size  and  densities  of the islands, which can be related to  thermodynamic  properties of the system. The experimental data will be compared  with  computer  simulations  to  determine growth  mechanisms  and  physical  parameters,  especially surface diffusion constants and line  tensions  for  different adsorbates.  Materials with a broad range of properties  and behaviors have been selected. STM will also provide information on  the  size dependence of the electronic property of the islands and the  unique properties of supported clusters.  %%%  The  ultimate objective in this research is to understand the  kinetic  and  thermodynamic  processes of nucleation and  growth  so  that  the  formation of an optimized structure of dots, lines, and/or planes  can  be  guided  through  control of deposition parameters  such  as  flux,  fluence and substrate temperature. The selected Materials have a broad  range  of  properties and behaviors. Techniques of Time-of Flight  Low  Energy Ion Scattering will provide information on the coverage of  the  surface   islands  during  material  deposition  to   obtain   kinetic  information. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) will be used to study  spatial  information such as shape, size and densities of the islands,  which  can  be related to thermodynamic properties of the system.  The  experimental data will be compared with computer simulations  data  to  determine   growth  mechanisms  and  physical  parameters,  especially  surface diffusion constants and line tensions for different adsorbates  STM  will  also  p rovide  information on the size  dependence  of  the  electronic  property  of  the islands and  the  unique  properties  of  supported clusters.  ***",
