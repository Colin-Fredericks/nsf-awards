 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514617  Brodfuehrer    It is commonly observed that an animal when presented with  the same stimulus on successive trials will often perform  different behaviors.  This means that an animal decides,  often very rapidly, which behavior is appropriate for the  circumstances at that moment.  The concept of `motivation'  is often used to explain this type of short-term behavioral  variability observed under conditions where sensory input is  constant.  The underlying neuronal mechanism of motivation,  however, has yet to be defined.  Since an animal's survival  depends upon it continually making the appropriate  behavioral response to ever changing environmental  conditions, understanding how an animal decides upon an  appropriate motor response is integral to our understanding  of animal behavior.    In the medicinal leech, research on the neuronal basis of  swimming has progressed to the point where the initiation of  swimming following body wall stimulation can be traced from  the sensory neurons that perceive the stimulus to the motor  neurons that produce the swimming movements.  However,  stimulation of this pathway does not always elicit swimming.  The probability that swimming occurs following a given  stimulus trial is quite variable.  The role that a pair of  identified interneurons in the leech head ganglion plays in  biasing the behavioral response of a leech toward swimming  following a given sensory input will be addressed in this  proposal.  The results generated from this study will  provide additional insights into the principles governing  behavioral variability in the leech with respect to the  initiation of swimming, and further enhance our  understanding of the types of neuronal networks and  mechanisms that can influence the motivational state of  animals.",
