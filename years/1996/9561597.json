 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will prepare bilayers and trilayers of thin film electrochromic metal oxides and analyze their spectroelectrochemical properties. In particular, the feasibility of achieving a flat gray scale electrochromic modulation and a three color electrochromic element will be explored. These materials will be incorporated into electrochromic window and display configurations currently under development. Successful completion will lead to at least two novel electrochromic products: 1) a high readability information display with two or more color capability, and 2) a neutral gray scale light transmission modulation coating for windows and other glass products.  Electrochromic materials change their optical spectrum reversibly when electrochemically cycled between oxidized and reduced forms. We propose here a new concept in electrochromic material design in which the selection of light attenuation wavelength range is much broader than is presently possible. The innovation is based on using bilayer and multilayer contiguous thin films of electrochromic inorganic oxides. It is anticipated that the multilayers will be in thermodynamic equilibrium, so that the total spectrum will be determined by the electrochemical potential of the assembly and the thicknesses of the contiguous layers. These considerations result in the possibility for design of electrochromic color and achievement of several colors depending on the applied potential.  The major commercial applications of electrochromic technology include: information displays; filters for optics, photography and electronic imaging; military low observable applications; ophthalmic eyewear and sunglasses; automobile mirrors, sunroofs, and glass; atria glass; and architectural glass for all kinds of buildings from passive solar dwellings to large office complexes.",
