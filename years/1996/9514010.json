 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Jeanne  9514010    The number of workers in some social insect colonies can  reach millions, yet they cooperate with one another and the  colonies smoothly accomplish all their necessary tasks.  It  has recently been discovered for a tropical social wasp that  the larger the colony, the greater its productive output per  worker.  This pattern contradicts previous understanding and  has direct implications for the evolution of colony size.  The purpose of the proposed research is to learn how the  behavior of workers in large colonies is organized  differently from that of small colonies and how these  differences give rise to the differences in productivity.      The research will be conducted on colonies in the field.  New colonies are founded by swarms of workers and queens.  Newly-founded colonies of different sizes will be made to  repair nest damage to provide data on numbers of workers  performing each type of work and their individual rates of  work.  Experimental manipulation of nest repair activity  will be used to reveal the behavioral cues workers use to  make decisions about whether to become active or idle.  At  the end of 25 days the colonies will be collected and the  size measured (number of workers).  The behavioral results  will be correlated with colony size to determine how the  changes in behavior at different colony size translate into  per capita differences in output.    The results of this study will explain the relationship  between the behavior of group members and group size.  The  resulting knowledge of the underlying mechanisms will  enhance our understanding of the evolution of large colony  size in social insects and may provide insights into how  human groups organize.",
