Each of the R8000 processors is capable of 300 MFlops peak performance.  The server will be configured with 512 MB RAM and 13 GB disk space.  The Large Scale Flow Separation with Applications in the design of air-cooled aircraft engines.  This project is related to an existing research arrangement between the University of South Alabama and local industry, the purpose of which is to increase our knowledge of the fluid flow about and heat transfer about finned cylinders.  The results may then be used to improve the design of cylinder barrels and cylinder heads for air-cooled aircraft engines.  Numerical studies of the evolution of a turbulent wing-tip vortex and vortex breakdown.  This project is related to the principal investigatorOs work with NASA to further our understanding of the effects of turbulence on vortex breakdown.  Unsteady mixed convection in horizontal ducts with applications in chemical vapor deposition processes.  In this NASA sponsored work, the experimentally observed process of spanwise symmetry breaking about the duct mid-plane will be investigated in an effort to provide a means of improved deposition uniformity within horizontal chemical vapor deposition reactors.  The computational facility will also improve the College of EngineeringOs ability to fulfill its support for graduate level education and applied research.  ***",
