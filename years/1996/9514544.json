 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514544  Woollacott    In everyday living, infants and children are continually  confronted with  potential threats to balance. We need a better understanding  of the  conditions that make balance difficult, how children respond  when balanced  is threatened, and how those responses change as children  grow and gain  experience. By artificially creating a threat to balance, we  can observe  these different balance recovery patterns and understand the  conditions  associated with balance control.  A second question is how  balance recovery  strategies change during early childhood and at what stage  children benefit  from practicing balance skills.    To answer these two questions we will create a disturbance  of balance by  unexpectedly moving the surface on which a child stands.  We  will record the  movement patterns used to recover balance and measure the  muscle responses  that underlie the recovery movements.    The results of the proposed research will contribute to our  understanding of  normal motor development, and will be particularly useful in  clinical  settings where the evaluation of  balance function of  children with motor  disabilities such as cerebral palsy is required. These data  will serve as a  basis for determining the time frame of the emergence of  normal balance  control and the ability to adapt balance adjustments to  changing conditions,  so that the performance of children with delays and  abnormalities in  development can be compared to this norm.",
