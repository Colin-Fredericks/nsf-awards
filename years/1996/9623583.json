 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is threefold.  First, methods will be   developed for the preparation of a new class of materials derived from   condensation of amino acids with both carboxy and amino termini of   polymeric sialic acid oligomers.  Second, solid support methods will be   developed for the preparation of a new class of materials utilizing   sialic acid as peptide equivalents.  Third, the solution phase   conformation of these materials will be examined using nuclear magnetic   resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular modeling.  Educational   activities involve a program in chemical education directed to developing   discovery based learning methods in organic chemistry. With this CAREER   award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the research and   educational activities of Dr. Jacqueline Gervay of the Department of   Chemistry at the University of Arizona.  Professor Gervay will focus her   research efforts on developing synthetic routes to novel materials that   will selectively replace important biological recognition processes.  The   synthetic targets include sialic acid based oligomeric compounds that   will disrupt protein-protein interactions involving both helical and   electrostatic interactions.  Dr. Gervay's educational activities involve   a program in chemical education directed to developing discovery based   learning methods in organic chemistry.",
