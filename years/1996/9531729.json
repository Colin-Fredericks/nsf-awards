 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with two performance enhancing techniques of VLSI  systems that have developed from wave pipelining: delay vernier architectures and  non-zero skew design methodologies.  Many high performance applications require  extremely fine timing resolution or very high data sampling rates.  Examples  include high speed network transceivers, A/D converters, phase-locked and delay-  locked and delay-locked loops, and ATE pin electronics.  Normally, expensive  circuit technologies and very high frequency clock signals are used to satisfy  these performance requirements.  However, the proposed delay vernier structures  are capable of achieving a very high time resolution using CMOS technologies and  relatively slow clock signals.  This research will focus on refining and  extending delay vernier architectures and design techniques so that their  usefulness is maximized.  The effectiveness of the architecture in a number of  applications will be evaluated.  Also, some real-world factors, such as process  variation and noise, will be investigated.  The non-zero skew design approach  allows the VLSI systems designer to take advantage of intentional skew to  optimize clock distribution for a particular set of propagation delays, and  thereby greatly improve system throughput.  A critical necessity for these  systems in the ability to create precise clock skews.  This research will focus  very strongly on the delay vernier technique, since it can provide this required  ability.  Finally, prototypes systems will be built for several promising  applications.",
