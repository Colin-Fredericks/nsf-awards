 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the last 20 years, our ability to link mental functions to  neurological substrates has been dramatically improved by a variety of  new technologies. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in  particular provides us, for the first time, the capability to link the  functional, anatomical, and behavioral aspects of brain function. The  ultimate objective of this proposal is to establish a human fMRI  facility in the Beckman Institute that will provide the neuroscience  community with a critical research tool to unravel the mystery of brain  function.    In this SGER proposal we will take the first steps to build this  facility by establishing a research partnership with the Carle  Foundation Hospital in Urbana, IL to use its MRI facility as a  \"test-bed\" for fMRI. UIUC cognitive neuroscientists have developed a  set of fMRI paradigms, already tested on either neuropsychological  populations and/or at other MRI facilities (Univ. of Minnesota, Univ.  of Chicago), that will be implemented on the GE Signa 1.5 T clinical  MRI system at the Carle Foundation Hospital. The Carle MRI system will  be upgraded with an advanced gradient set (Signa Horizon) for high  speed imaging, purchased jointly by Carle and UIUC, to permit state-of-  the-art fMRI to be achieved. This SGER proposal is needed to obtain  funds to complete the initial cooperative studies that will prepare the  way for a future ARI proposal.    We have a very strong group of physical scientists in the Magnetic  Resonance Engineering Laboratory, the Biomedical Magnetic Resonance  Laboratory and the Image Processing Laboratory who have been  instrumental in pioneering new data acquisition methods, digital signal  processing routines, and RF coil design and modeling approaches. With  the existing interdisciplinary team of neuroscientists and engineers  within the Beckman Institute, and the collaboration of Carle  Radiologists and GE Medical Systems personnel, we are poised to push  the fMRI technology to the limits of its potential a nd make use of this  unprecedented opportunity to advance our knowledge of human brain  function.",
