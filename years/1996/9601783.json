 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601783  Frost    This grant, made through the Academic Research  Infrastructure (ARI) Program, provides $250,000 as  one-half support of the costs of acquiring a  thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) with  ion counting capabilities for use in isotopic  studies of igneous petrogenesis, thermochronology  and geochronology for tectonic studies, and  environmental isotope geochemistry at the  University of Wyoming.  The instrument will  replace a somewhat antiquated VG TIMS purchased in  1984 but more recently upgraded in 1989.  However,  since the upgrade, the instrument has been plagued  with technical problems that have only more  recently (1993) been rectified and data produced.  The 50% match from the University of Wyoming is  part of a one-time, $18M state supported Geology  building expansion/improvement. Specific studies  that will utilize the capabilities of this new  TIMS will include research on the petrogenesis of  the Laramie Anorthosite Complex and Aleutian and  Caribbean arc magmas through examination of Pb, Sr  and Nd isotopic signatures, the tectonic evolution  of the Western U.S. based on thermochronologic and  geochronologic techniques and Sr and Nd isotopic  studies of groundwater hydrology and weathering  processes.  ***",
