 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, which is supported by the Theoretical and Computational   chemistry program,  professor Schaefer at the University of Georgia  will continue his investigations of the electronic structure of atoms and   molecules and the reactions which they  undergo.  The research program is   composed of two parts.  The first is the development and testing of new   methods, while the second is the application of these methods to relevant   and interesting chemical problems.  The methods to be developed are all   aimed at a more accurate description of the potential energy surface(s)   which describe a molecule and the energy changes once  the molecule is distorted and reaction occurs.  Of particular focus in   this granting period will be an implementation of coupled cluster methods   applicable to open shell species.  Additionally  Schaefer will   investigate approximations to another electron-correlation method, namely   second-order configuration interaction.  During this grant period a number of chemical applications will also be   pursed.   A partial list of these projects includes:  a detailed examination of the   phenylcarbene/tropylidene potential energy surface; the equilibrium   geometry of the ammonia dimer; an investigation of a direct iron-iron   bond in the complex Fe2(CO)9.  Further investigations will also probe   whether hybrid density functional theory Hartree-Fock methods can resolve   the apparent inconsistencies between molecular mechanics and experiment   for the thermochemistry of C20H20.",
