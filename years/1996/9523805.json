 "awd_abstract_narration": "A comprehensive information-theoretic study of the capacity of  communication channels where information is transmitted via timing  is undertaken. Communication channels that lend themselves to this  study include: queueing systems, random transit channels, protocol  information, covert channels, time-jitter storage channels,  intracomputer communications subject to timing uncertainties. The  study of the capacity of the above models may be relevant in  stochastic discrete-event systems outside the realm of  communications. Among the random phenomena that blur timing  information, queueing is one of the most important practically and  theoretically. Queues are the basic modeling blocks of data  communication networks, so finding their Shannon capacity is a  problem for which there is ample motivation. Very recent results by  Anantharam and Verdu for the single-server queue have shown  considerable promise, and the Shannon theoretic study of queueing  systems plays a central role in this project. In these problems,  information is encoded in the times of arrival of packets to the  queueing system (in addition to the contents of those packets), and  the receiver observes the times of departure of the packets from  the queueing system. The common theme of the foregoing channel  models is communication via discrete-events in continuous time. In  most of these cases, finding the capacity of those channels is far  from elementary because information theoretic challenges such as  infinite memory, non-additive noise, feedback, non-standard input  constraints, nonlinear input-output dependencies are often present.  Source coding problems such as the rate distortion function of the  Poisson process and communication via observed Markov processes are  also under the purview of this project. In those problems,  exponentially distributed times play a central role, for which the  rich information theoretic structure of Gaussian problems finds a  novel counterpart. The tools required in this study are drawn fr om  probability, random processes and optimization; specifically from  information theory, queueing theory, Markov processes, and data  communication networks.",
