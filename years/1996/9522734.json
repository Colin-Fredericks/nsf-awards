 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522734  Idriss  Cracking is among the most important parameters that adversely  influences the structural design and durability of concrete  elements.  More advanced nondestructive testing methodologies are  needed for applications to bridge structures.  Proper testing  methodologies for early detection of cracks are either non-  existence or not readily applicable to large concrete bridge  systems.  Research is needed for the development of embedded  sensors for real-time detection, and measurement of displacements  associated with crack openings and propagations.  The research  will examine the feasibility of using a system of optical fiber  sensors for integration in an experimental full scale bridge  structure.  The optical fiber sensing system will be employed in  detection of cracks and measurement of displacements associated  with their progression.  Research studies will be performed  through a series of research and development activities,  addressing optimization with respect to three important issues,  namely, practicality, sensitivity of measurements, and capability  in simultaneous detection of cracks emanating from different  locations in the structure.  Simultaneous measurement of  displacements, at several location, will be achieved in a time  domain, through interrogation of reflected optical pulses.  The  study will involve a series of experiments at small, as well as  full scale implementation in a bridge structure.  The full scale  structure will be a 40 ft simple span, reinforced concrete slab,  steel girder bridge.  Conventional displacement measuring  devices, such as strain gauges, and LVDT's will be employed in  the examining the data acquired from embedded optical fibers.  ***",
