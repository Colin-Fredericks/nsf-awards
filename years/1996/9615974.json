GPS  synchronized measurements open new avenues of applications such  as adaptive relaying, advanced feed-back control techniques,  better estimation or determination of system losses and improved  state estimation determination of system losses and improved  state estimation of the power system.  Also, controlled  separation of power systems during emergency conditions using  phasor measurements has been studied and implemented.  Precise  measurement and oscillographic recordings are of great use in  analyzing system events, providing benchmarks for validating  simulation programs, and provide a diagnostic tool for power  equipment.       It is our hope that we can bring together the researchers,  utility engineers, manufacturers and other interested individuals  to promote an exchange of ideas, applications of these new  technologies, and identify new research areas.  The meeting  format will include one half day of tutorial presentations  followed by one half day of presentations by authors of papers.   Papers from field engineers are sought, and will be mailed to all  participants in a bound conference proceedings within a month  after the conference. It is recognized that commercial  manufacturers of modern measuring and recording instruments, with  or without precise synchronization, have helped make this  technology a practical engineering option.  Several manufacturers  will exhibit their latest measuring and recording equipment  during the conference lunch breaks and after the technical  sessions.  ***",
