 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past several decades work on prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell systems have provided significant insights on basic mechanisms that regulate the expression of the gene.  Little is known about how specific genes regulate physiological function in the whole animal.  Recently, investigators studying in the area of Molecular and Cellular Biology have witnessed the development of exciting new technologies that allow manipulation of the mammalian genome in the intact animal.  The University of Cincinnati is recognized as a national leader in the development and experimental use of transgenic and gene targeted mice.  These animals provide unique models for studying the physiological significance of expressed genes on organ systems function.  The development of experimental approaches and techniques to determine the functional phenotype and study the physiological performance in gene manipulated animals is a primary institutional and national need.   Funding from the National Science Foundation, in addition to resources from the institution and the State of Ohio, will be used to renovate existing research space located in the Medical Science Building for the Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology.  Renovations will consist of: upgrading electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, reconfiguring space, and installing benches, fume hoods, and other fixed equipment. The Department has strong programs in membrane biophysics, molecular endocrinology, signal transduction, gene regulation, neurophysiology, muscle energetics and metabolism, membrane transport, and cardiovascular/pulmonary physiology.  The renovations will strengthen these programs by providing modern faculty research laboratories, a molecular biology core facility, a transgenic physiology core facility, and shared research support facilities.  Modernization of this space will significantly augment the Department's efforts in recruiting new faculty with research expertise in molecular physiology, and attract outstanding graduate students interested in using molecular biological approaches to study organ system physiology.  This project will enhance the ability of the Department to have an impact on biology-oriented research at the University and in the nation.",
