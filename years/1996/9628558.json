The  equipment will be used for several projects including in  particular:  Computational Issues in Biomechanics,  Computational Problems in Complex Analysis and Applications,  Numerical Methods for Vlasov Kinetic Equations and  Computational Issues in the Enzyme Activity in Cotton  Seedlings.  The four projects listed are computationally and  graphics intensive and the equipment requested is essential  for the success of these four projects.  The four projects  cover a wide range of pure and applied mathematics ranging  from complex analysis to an application from agriculture, to  a problem of determining the stress in the tibia during  exercise and to a classical problem in transport theory.   The common thread that connects these problems is the need  for accurate, fast computation and the ability to visualize  the results with detailed graphics.",
