 "awd_abstract_narration": "9422392  Ribak         One of the parts of the brain important for learning in mammals is  called the hippocampus, lying deep beneath the cererbral  hemispheres.  The hippocampus contains a curled formation called  the dentate gyrus, which has three layers of nerve cells, or  neurons.   These neurons have characteristic shapes and some of  their connections are known to form particular local circuits.  The  basket cells, granule cells, mossy cells and mossy fibers form  circuits that are believed to underlie the functions of spatial  learning.  The postnatal development of the functional connections  within these circuits are important to know if we are to understand  the role of the hippocampus in early learning.  This collaborative  work by an electron microscopist and a neurophysiologist examines  the ultrastructure of synapses (the functional cellular  connections) between particular classes of neurons and the membrane  properties of those neurons.  Documenting changes in these  structural and functional features during development will allow a  better understanding of how the hippocampus begins to function  during early learning.  The results will be important not only for  understanding brain development, but also for psychological studies  on learning.",
