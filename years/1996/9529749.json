The calcium  carbonate- carbon dioxide system is in fact one of the major  geochemical features of the marine environment. Recent data  strongly suggest that variations in calcium concentrations in the  ocean are not quite equal to those one would expect based on the  corresponding variations in alkalinity. This means that there is  something about this major marine geochemical system that we do not  understand.         In this project, scientists at the University of Washington  will carry out a detailed study of calcium and alkalinity  variations in the oceanic water column with two ends in mind.   First they will characterize the calcium-alkalinity discrepancy  on  a global basis by surveying waters of the Northwest Pacific,  Northeast Pacific, Southeast Pacific, and the North Indian Ocean.  Secondly, they will also make high-precision measurements of  magnesium and lithium concentrations and lithium isotope  distributions on a global scale to test the hypothesis that the Ca-  alkalinity discrepancy can be explained by hydrothermal input of  ocean ridges.",
