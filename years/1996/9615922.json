 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615922  HUNTLEY-FENNER    This research will address two issues.  The first is the  development of physical knowledge in infancy, specifically when  and how infants come to distinguish between objects and  noncohesive particulate materials such as sand or flour.  The  second is the development of quantificational reasoning, such as  the distinction between \"how much\" and \"how many.\"  There is  considerable evidence that infants have a sophisticated  understanding of the physical world.  Much of this evidence comes  from research focused on infants' understanding of objects.  But,  as adults, our physical reasoning encompasses an understanding  both of objects and of noncohesive and particulate substances.   Such substances are similar to objects, since both are material  entities subject to the constraints of space and time and, for  instance, neither can pass through a physical barrier.  However,  only objects cohere when moved.  The first part of this research  will address whether infants monitor the properties of a  stimulus, be it an object or not, and the properties of the  surface onto which it is lowered to judge whether the stimulus  will be supported or not.  The second part will build on the fact  that objects and noncohesive substances are quantified  differently, with objects being inherently individuated and  noncohesive substances continuing to be the same kind of stuff  whether they are separated into arbitrary pieces or whether  scattered portions are coalesced into one.  This part will  determine whether infants are capable of using both  quantificational strategies, such that in some cases judgments  are made about discrete quantities and in others made about  continuously measured abilities.  This research will, thus,  contribute to our understanding of the capabilities of very young  infants that afford their development into adults who can  function easily in our complex society.    ***",
