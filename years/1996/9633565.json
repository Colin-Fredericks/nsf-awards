 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633565  Brady  The past several years have seen continuing improvement in  materials and techniques for persistent spectral holeburning  (PSHB).  These improvements have in several cases yielded  demonstration projects tantalizingly close to marketplace viability  but no immediate plans for deliverable products are known.  This  workshop will consider how the community might overcome this  roadblock and begin to address real and compelling applications.   The workshop will include focused presentations on key issues  identified by the organizing committee and active working group  sessions on specific problems.    PSHB is applicable to both large market applications like digital  data storage and optical communications and to smaller market  applications like transient data sensors and analog signal  processing.  To be applied in practice, PSHB must overcome one of  two barriers:    o To be applied where there exist competing technologies, such as  data storage, a PSHB system must carry sufficient advantages to  overcome the natural bias against changes in fundamental hardware  technology    o To be applied where there exists no competing technologies, such  as transient signal capture, the advantages of the application must  be sufficient to support its development.    In general, the barrier to development for new applications is  lower than the barrier to development for established applications  and once a technology, such as PSHB, is established for a new small  market application, the barrier to transferring it to an  established larger market application is reduced.  ***",
