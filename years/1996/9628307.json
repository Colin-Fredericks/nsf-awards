Libby Cohen    Biotechnology Works! recognizes the National Science Foundation's  priority to facilitate the participation of persons with  disabilities in mathematics and science.  During two summers and  two school years (1996-1998), this project will demonstrate that an  existing curriculum for high school students in biotechnology can  be adapted for students with disabilities.  In addition, the  project will demonstrate that high school teachers, who work along  side their students, are able to modify their instruction and  laboratories.  Specifically, the project staff will:  1) offer  intensive sessions in biotechnology, and mathematics that are  related to biotechnology, for students in grades 10-12; 2) train  the students' high school biology teachers to adapt high school  science coursework in immunology and genetics for students with  disabilities; and 3) disseminate project information and products.   The project goal is to demonstrate that students with  disabilities can participate successfully in existing high school  level biotechnology educational activities that have been modified  and adapted to meet their needs.  Ten teachers and 10 students  with disabilities will participate in the project which will be  offered in three locations:  the University of Southern Maine,  Foundation for Blood Research, and the Maine Medical Center.   This will give the students and their teachers the opportunity to  work in real laboratories with scientists.  ***",
