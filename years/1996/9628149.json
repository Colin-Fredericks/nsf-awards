 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object-oriented approach to program design has made a  significant impact on the way software is developed and  maintained. Programmers have adopted the object-oriented  approach in order to take advantage of better data  abstraction, re-use through inheritance, and polymorphism.  However, the very features which make the object-oriented  paradigm attractive also make object-oriented programs more  difficult to understand. The majority of current object-  oriented software development environments and aids provide  textual interfaces through which programmers can answer  queries about the program state and assess program  performance. The hypothesis of this project is that textual  tools for understanding object-oriented programs, although  absolutely essential, either fail to provide all the  information required by programmers about the dynamics and  global behavior of their code, or they provide information  in a manner that is cumbersome to acquire. Program  visualization, through the use of graphics and animation,  provides users with a more complete understanding of their  code, both statically and dynamically.    The goal of this project is to develop a visualization  framework with innovative graphical views that assist  programmers to understand, analyze, test, debug, and  optimize their code.  The views illustrate both important  details about a program and the global context of how  particular pieces of code relate to the entire program. An  initial technique being used is called the Information  Mural, which presents very large program event traces using  a focus-plus-context display. One important aspect of the  work with the Information Mural is to identify patterns in  the execution of a program.  ***",
