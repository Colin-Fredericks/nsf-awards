 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514583  Lawrence      When females of the parasitic wasp Diachasmimorpha longicaudata lay their eggs in larvae of the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspense (host) they also introduce a virus into the blood of the host. In addition, a new protein appears in the blood of the parasitized larvae within 2 days after parasitization but is absent from unparasitized individuals. The PI has shown that the level of this protein increases in the host's blood at the same time as the virus begins to infect new host cells. In addition, infected host cells round up and do not form protective defense capsules as do cells from unparasitized fruit flies. Consequently, the parasite eggs and larvae escape encapsulation by the host and the parasite develops at the expense of the fruit fly. Thus, this parasite is an excellent biological control agent.  The PI proposes to determine whether the protein is a gene product of the virus and whether it enhances virus infectivity. The PI will also identify the effects of both protein and virus on the cellular communication and defense system of the host.  Since the Caribbean fruit fly and its close relatives like the Mediterranean fruit fly are major pests of citrus and other agricultural crops, the PI's basic studies will provide significant insights into the potential of protein and/or virus as tools in fruit fly developmental disruption and control. Additionally, the PI's findings will shed light on whether membrane carbohydrates (sugars) are important in cell-cell recognition and defense. The findings will also help to identify possible factors (sugars) that enhance and/or suppress cell aggregation (tumor formation).  ***",
