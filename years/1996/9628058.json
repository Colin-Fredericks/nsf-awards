 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feedback-based congestion control schemes become an integral part of the  connectionless ABR (Available Bit Rate) service class in ATM networks. The  major objective of the proposed research is to build a theoretical  foundation to feedback congestion control schemes. The basis of the  foundation is the fixed-point model, which captures the feed-back feature  of ABR congestion control schemes in a system of delay differential  equations and produce fixed-point constant solutions in terms of the source  cell rates and the buffer lengths. lamely, we consider a broad class of  schemes which can produce a stable buffer length even when sources always  try to transmit at their maximum rates.    Analyses of the fixed point model in the context of ABR feedback control  schemes have generated a number of results regarding stabilities of  fixed-point solutions. The proposed research will first compare the  stability region of parameter space derived from the delay differential  equations with that obtained by discrete simulation techniques. We are  interested in effects of incorporating details of control protocols in  simulation on resulting changes in the stability region. Besides, the fixed  point model will be investigated in the environments where ABR bandwidth  changes in time as the number of CBR and VBR connections changes. Since the  fixed-point model is constructed in a general context, application of the  model to several control theoretic strategies (such as a proportional plus  derivative control) will be investigated.    When a congestion develops (either due to a new active ABR source or due to  a reduced ABR bandwidth), buffer lengths increase before they stabilize to  a new steady-state buffer length. Since buffer transients are inevitable,  we will investigate strategies that can control the buffer transients in a  predictable manner. We will first characterize transients in terms of  bounds: the maximum overshoot in buffer lengths, the rise time until the  buffer length reaches its  maximum, and the settling time for the buffer  length to reach its new steady-state value. According to the fixed-point  model, relationships between the set of parameters and the transient bounds  will be investigated. The relationships are to be studied in increasingly  complex network configurations.",
