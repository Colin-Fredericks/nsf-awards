SMSSI will bring between 20  and 30 Chicano, Latino and Native American undergraduates to Cornell University  for an intensive six-week summer program in mathematical biology.  The 1996  SMSSI  will take place between June 17 - July 26, 1996.  Participants will receive  round-trip transportation to Ithaca, NY, room and board, and a $2000 stipend.  The program is designed for undergraduates who will complete their sophomore or  junior year during 1996. Students majoring in mathematics, biology, or related  fields and who have had a year of calculus, are eligible to apply. The academic  content of the 1996 Institute has been designed by Principal Investigator  Professor Castillo-Chavez, a leading mathematical biologist at Cornell  University and a member of the Board of Directors of the Society for  Mathematical Biology. Emphasis will be placed on studying the mathematical  theory of population dynamics and its applications to demography, ecology,  epidemiology, and evolutionary biology. The SMSSI will include dynamical systems   and stochastic processes seminars, a writing seminar intimately  connected to the study of theoretical biology, analysis and numerical  simulations of mathematical models associated with group research projects,  workshops on applying for admissions and funding for graduate school, and  colloquia given by invited mathematicians and scientists. Applications may also  be requested from the SACNAS office by phone: 408-459-4272 or e-mail:  sacnas@cats.ucsc.edu.  Additional information about the program may be obtained  by contacting Herbert A. Medina by phone at 310-338-5113 or via e-mail a t  hmedina@lmumail.lmu.edu or Carlos Castillo-Chavez by phone at 607-255-5488 or  via e-mail at cc32@cornell.edu.",
