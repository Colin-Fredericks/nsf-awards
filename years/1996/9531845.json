 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531845  Slemrod         The project entails investigation into kinetic models and macroscopic  hydrodynamics of \"gas like\" systems which exhibits changes of phase.   The investigation will yield understanding of fundamental principles of  liquid-vapor phase transitions, computational methods for analysis of  liquid-vapor interface dynamics, and with respect to \"gas like\" modeling  of granular materials.  The tools used in the investigation will be  mathematical ideas in the kinetic theory of dense gases, asymptotic  analysis, and fundamental ideas in the theory of one complex variable (as  needed for the Yang-Lee theory of phase transitions).  The project will  then use these tools to develop the relevant macroscopic flow equations  for liquid-vapor systems including metastable states and analyze such  flows.  In addition, in the study of the granular flows the project will  develop the asymptotic ideas necessary to understand the issues of shear  band formation and elastic collapse in rapid granular flow.   %%%        The project will provide knowledge in several technologically important  fields.  For example, modeling of rapid flow of granular materials is  important in the transfer of bulk materials (coal, cereals,  pharmaceuticals).  New results in dynamics of liquid-vapor phase   transitions will provide new mathematical and computation techniques for  the studying the behavior aerosols, underwater detonations, and two  phase fluid flow in nuclear reactors.  Another possible benefit is that  ideas obtained in studying liquid-vapor flow may be carried over to phase  transitions in solids as well, e.g. modeling of modern \"shape memory\"  materials.   ***",
