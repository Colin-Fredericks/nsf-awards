Jones, Department of Astronomy,  University of Minnesota, to pursue with Professor Dongsu Ryu, Department of Astronomy  and Space Science, Chungnam National University, for 24 months, a program of cooperative  research on the development of a new multi-dimensional computer code for  magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in astrophysics.  The code is designed to solve problems  involving fully ionized, magnetized plasmas in astrophysical environments.  The code will be  built from an extension to MHD of Harten's \"Total Variation Diminishing\" second-order  accurate scheme for gasdynamics.  A one-dimensional MHD has already been developed.  The  objective of the present work is to extend the method to mulitdimensional flows and to  improve its performance in some important respects.    The initial application will be to the study of the nonlinear evolution of unstable boundary  layers, or contact surfaces, inside so-called blast waves.  These structures are important  features to understand in young supernova remnants, for example, and are also expected to be  modified by the presence of magnetic fields. The collaborators are recognized as experts in  the field of this research.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea  Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S.  and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,  skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual interest and benefit.   Korean participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
