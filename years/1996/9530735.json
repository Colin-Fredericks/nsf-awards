The  objectives in a broad sense are the characterization and  quantification of chemically mediated ecological  relationships among antarctic benthic invertebrates.  There  are several specific objectives to investigate during two  field seasons.  Research will involve an evaluation of  chemical defenses in adult antarctic marine invertebrates  and  also early life history stages.  Investigators will  evaluate lecithotrophic eggs, embryos and larvae for  bioactivity.  This is particularly relevant as many  Antarctic invertebrates broadcast conspicuous lecithotrophic  embryos and larvae which require two to six months to  develop while in the plankton.  It has been observed  that  colored sponges use their pigments as defensive agents, and  their functional role will be investigated in sponges and in  other colored invertebrates. Furthermore, bioactive  metabolite concentration and sequestration will be  investigated in invertebrates from which secondary  metabolites have been isolated.  And finally work will  continue on the isolation and characterization of bioactive  compounds from invertebrates for the purpose of evaluating  their functional role. Significant aspects of the research  are the use of ecologically relevant bioassays to guide the  isolation, on-site at McMurdo Station, of the active  chemical agents, and subsequent characterization of those  metabolites at our home institutions. In summary, the  proposed program will make a significant contribution to the  understanding of the nature and role of bioactive agents in  the ecology of the Antarctic marine benthos.",
