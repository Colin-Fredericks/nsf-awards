The meeting, entitled, \"Patterning Mechanisms in Development\", will be held May 30-June 4, 1996 at Vanderbilt University. The meeting is organized by William Jeffery, President of the SDB, and will be attended by a national group of researchers and teachers interested in the study of development, including graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The organizers expect that, as during the past eight years, the meeting will be of medium size (300-400 registrants), and they encourage junior level participation by providing financial support and the opportunity to present platform talks and poster presentations. The meeting will include a broad range of topics, considered to be new frontiers in pattern formation, continuing and building on the format that has evolved in the past four year. Plant and animal systems as well as different contemporary approaches will be represented. Particular emphasis will be on early developmental mechanisms, localization, cell signaling, morphogenesis, regeneration, organ formation, and the evolution of these developmental processes. They plan 53 invited scientific talks in seven plenary sessions and 4 minisymposia, the latter arranged in two sessions(two minisymposia running concurrently), and a keynote lecture. The plenary sessions and minisymposia will be chaired by experts in the area, and some talks will be given by junior scientists, thus providing them with an opportunity to speak a the national level. Contributed platform and poster sessions will also provide opportunities for graduate and postdoctoral students to present their work. The posters will be available for viewing during most of the meeting, providing ample time for discussion. Reflecting the growing role  of the SDB in the affairs and concerns of its membership, this symposium will continue to feature issue oriented workshops on education and minority interests.  ***",
