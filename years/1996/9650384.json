 "awd_abstract_narration": "A networked computer laboratory will be developed to promote interdisciplinary studies of earth systems in the undergraduate geography curriculum.   This technology will be used to Integrate earth systems modeling techniques with the data-management and analytical capabilities of the UNIDATA meteorological software and datastream, geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing.  These are important components of active learning in such fields as global environmental change, resource analysis, and human-environmental interaction.    Traditionally, earth systems modeling and technique-focused courses have followed separate sequences in undergraduate instruction. The objective of this project is to integrate elements of conceptual modeling of geographic phenomena into the \"tools\" courses through specially designed exercises within an integrated laboratory learning environment. These exercises, implementing the discovery method of instruction, enable undergraduate students to develop systems thinking and analytical and group work skills through experimentation with environmental models and working with real-world data. The traditional style of laboratory instruction in climatology, as well as GIS and remote sensing, is being changed to emphasize group and individual problem-solving and decision-making through interaction with a modeling environment. Six courses are being redesigned within this project. The laboratory can be used by at least 210 undergraduates each year in geography and related earth sciences programs.    Implementing this approach can be accomplished by integrating state-of-the-art GIS, remote sensing, and climatology instrumentation with commercially available simulation modeling software. The core of the Earth Systems Modeling Laboratory consists of 18 Pentium and several SUN workstations linked by a local area network. The integrated problem-solving and modeling experience can be evaluated for learning processes and outcomes, and results can be prepared for publication  and presentation to geographic and educational communities.",
