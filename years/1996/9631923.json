 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study the theoretical and numerical  analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs),  especially those of mixed type and generalized Monge-Ampere (MA)  equations.  These equations arise in several applications.  The  first application is that of optical system deign and analysis.   The second is the design of fuel-efficient axisymmetric bodies  and the study of axisymmetric jet flows.  Ultimately in both of  the above applications, one must solve a nonlinear Monge-Ampere  equation which may be of elliptic, hyperbolic, or mixed type.  As  with most completely nonlinear PDEs, one does not expect to find  existence or uniqueness results for these equations except in  special cases.  However, in order for work on these applications  to maintain interest outside the mathematics community, one must  demonstrate solidly how the techniques in modeling optical  systems or airplane wings can be use to design such objects  effectively.  Therefore, some questions which must be considered  are:    -What are well-posed boundary value problems?    -Are there cases of interest for which one can establish  existence or uniqueness results?    -What numerical schemes would provide the best solutions to the     MA equations?    -What can we say about these numerical solutions mathematically?    While the MA equations describing the two applications are  considerably different, progress in answering these questions for  one MA equation may lead to the answers for other equations.    The investigators planning activities will include several visits  to the University of Delaware to meet with Professors L. Pamela  Cook and Gilberto Schleiniger who will advise her as she seeks  answers to the questions posed above.",
