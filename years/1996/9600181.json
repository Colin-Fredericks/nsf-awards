The two groups  will unite their expertise to focus on the problems of  contamination of waters and soils by heavy metals, including  radio nuclides, oils, and other waste, making use of the  experience in phytoremediation for heavy metals of the U.S.  group and the use by the Brazilian group of hydrophobic  aquatic plants for removal of oils.  Mechanisms contributing  to metal ion or oil uptake will be studied in detail.  New  floatation techniques centering around variants of tall  column devices will also be expanded.    The work takes advantage of overlapping areas of expertise  in the two countries and will contribute significantly to  the development of graduate students who will participate.  The support for the Brazilian team is provided by CNPq as  part of a bilateral U.S.-Brazil agreement.    ***",
