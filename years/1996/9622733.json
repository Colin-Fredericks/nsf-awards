 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622733  Wang  This project will investigate the structure and formation of  metal carbide clusters (MxCy, where M is a metal and C is  elemental carbon) in the gas phase, as well as the  nanomaterials formed by these clusters in the condensed  phase.  The gas phase study involves anion photoelectron  spectroscopy, which will provide fundamental understanding  of the structure and bonding of the MxCy clusters in a wide  size range.  The technique is also sensitive to subtle  differences in bonding and structures between carbon and  different transition metals.  The condensed phase study  involves preparation of MxCy nanocluster samples by a novel  laser vaporization deposition technique and characterization  using various  modern microscopies (TEM, STM, AFM).  The gas  phase studies will lead to insight into the formation  mechanisms of three classes of novel materials: endohedral  metallo-fullerenes, single-shell carbon nanotubes, and  metallo-carbohedrenes.  Through the combined gas phase and  condensed phase studies, this project has  the potential to  discover new carbon-metal nanoclusters with novel electronic  and catalytic properties and efficient  methods to  synthesize them.  The project involves major collaborative  work at the Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories.  The  project is co-funded between the Condensed Matter Physics  Program and the Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics  Program NSF.  %%%  Carbon and metals form a class of metal carbide materials  with unusual properties that find applications in electronic  materials for making faster computers, in catalysis, such as  automobile catalytic converters, and in tool hardening  manufacturing processes.  These properties can be enhanced  or modified when the materials are made of small carbide  particles, called nanoclusters, some of which are composed  of new, stable metal-carbon molecules.  This project  investigates the mechanisms of formation of such carbide  nanoparticles and the new metal-carbon molecular forms, and  al so will study the unique physical and chemical properties  of these clusters.  Understanding the formation mechanisms  will lead to more efficient methods to tailor the design of  the nanoclusters with desired properties.  The project  involves major collaborative work at the Battelle Pacific  Northwest Laboratories.
