 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanical engineers have long recognized that the optimum way to match the performance characteristics of an  engine to the drive train of a vehicle is with a continuously variable transmission; and for more than 100 years,  designers have tried unsuccessfully to develop one which can match the torque capacity, efficiency, size, weight  and manufacturing cost of stepped\u00c3ratio transmissions. In 1989, Epilogics introduced the first fully geared,  continuously variable transmission for automobile and trucking applications. This transmission, called the IVT, has  the potential to satisfy these needs without sacrificing size, safety or performance. The key technical issue is that  of mechanical stresses on the internal components of the IVT. A thorough and systematic engineering analysis of  operating forces indicates that the most critical component is the one\u00c3way clutch. Such clutches in conventional  transmissions are cycled only when changing gears. Nominal lifetime requirements are one million cycles. The one\u00c3  way clutch in the IVT, without which the transmission would not work, is cycled once every revolution of the  transmission. The lifetime requiremeilt is 600 million cycles, or more than two orders of magnitude greater than the  requirements of a standard device. The lack of a one\u00c3way clutch is presently the key technical barrier to the  widespread commercial development of the IVT. The goal of the Phase I research project is to demonstrate the  feasibility of developing a suitable one\u00c3way clutch. If successful, Phase II will carry the development further by  building a number of pre\u00c3commercial prototype units and comprehensively testing them. If a technical solution can  be demonstrated, Epilogics has an industrial partner ready to pursue the initial commercialization of the technology.",
