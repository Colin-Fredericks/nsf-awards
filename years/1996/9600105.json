 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600105  Hirschfeld  Theoretical research designed to aid in the identification  of the pairing state of the copper oxide and heavy fermion  superconductors and the development of a practical theory of  transport below the critical temperature will be conducted.  The primary focus will be on the effect of disorder and  magnetic field on low-temperature properties.  Previous  theory has provided a good description of experimental  results reflecting the disorder-dependent quasiparticle  density of states in terms of a dirty d-wave picture.  Calculations of the scattering amplitude for a d-wave order  parameter will be performed, including self-consistent off  diagonal scattering, in an attempt to address inadequacies  of the simplest models of this kind in the description of  transport properties.  Such corrections to the theory may  not be ignored and are likely to introduce qualitatively new  physics.  At all stages, comparisons will be made with  anisotropic s-wave states to search for qualitative  differences.    Several instances in the theory where deviations from the  usual model spherical or ellipsoidal Fermi surface can lead  to qualitatively new effects will be investigated.  Examples  include the breaking of spurious isotropy of transport  coefficients in the E2u pairing scenario for UPt3 by  hexagonal anisotropy, and the creation of matrix elements  for off-diagonal scattering due to orthorhombicity in the d  wave model for YBCO and BSCCO.    Finally, transport properties of unconventional  superconductors in a finite magnetic field will be  calculated, accounting for the most significant unusual  features of the unconventional vortex lattice, such as the  large density of unbound quasiparticle excitations over the  entire vortex.  This will involve a careful analysis of the  scattering cross-section for electrons from a single d-wave  vortex.  A semimicroscopic transport theory including  impurity scattering will then be formulated and applied to  measurements of thermal and electric al conductivities and  Hall coefficients in the superconducting state.  %%%  Theoretical research will be conducted on various aspects of  superconductivity in the high temperature superconductors  and the so-called heavy-fermion superconductors.  In  particular, studies will be made of transport properties and  on the effects of disorder and magnetic fields on  superconducting state properties.  ***",
