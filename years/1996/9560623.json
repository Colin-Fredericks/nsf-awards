 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will apply reinforcing agents in a robust structural composite. When fully developed, this concept will foster a new class of reinforced materials with superior resistance to fracture when compared to conventional materials reinforced with platelets, whiskers and continuous fibers. These conventional materials have failed to deliver the strength and toughness necessary to overcome market resistance to so-called `brittle` materials.   This project will deliver major increases in fracture resistance of matrix materials by close-packing these novel particles so that, unlike the 2-dimensional or planar toughness of conventional reinforcements, true 3-dimensional toughness may be obtained. Unlike platelets, whiskers and continuous fibers, these reinforcements are inherently sound architecturally, and nest, or pack together on a co-planar basis. The resulting crack path between these reinforcements is highly tortuous and 3-dimensional.   This proposed solution to the strength and toughness problems of conventional ceramics offers lower cost manufacturing possibilities as well an improved lifetime.   Potential uses of the results of this research include: 1) refractory composites for the heat treating industry for bricks, castables, gunnables, and monolithic linings, 2) cementitous matrix composites for radioactive or hazardous waste containment, 3) high strength-to-weight composites for critical load-bearing industrial construction applications, 4) road repair materials, 5) critical aircraft takeoff and landing area materials, and 6) in non-structural areas, catalytic support components and fluidized bed components will benefit from the superior surface-to-volume of these shapes.",
