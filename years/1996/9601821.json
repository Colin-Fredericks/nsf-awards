 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire (UWEC) proposes a major  equipment upgrade in its electron microscope center with the  purchase of a new Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and  associated TEM preparation equipment. The proposed equipment will  augment equipment purchased almost 20 years ago and will function  in support of both the university's teaching and undergraduate  collaborative research mission. The new TEM will have both  analytical and video capabilities that do not exist with the  current instrumentation. Development of this lab will ensure that  UWEC remains a well respected regional laboratory for the  analysis of materials using electron microscopy.          Four departments currently use the electron microscopes for  instruction of undergraduate students (Biology, Chemistry,  Physics and Geology) and well over 100 students have been trained  to do EM in the existing facility. Faculty members currently use  the facility for research with graduate and undergraduate  students in Biology and with undergraduate students in materials  science and mineralogy. The enhanced resolution and analytical  capabilities of the new instrument will draw additional  researchers including one new UWEC faculty member (Dr. Anne  Geraghty - plant physiology/plant molecular biology) who is  experienced in immunocytochemical localization techniques for  TEM. This powerful research tool forms an important link with the  highly successful interdisciplinary program in biochemistry/  molecular biology which is one of the most popular majors on  campus and draws some of UWEC's best students. This will ensure  more use of electron microscopy in the future. Since UWEC has  been designated the University of Wisconsin System Center of  Excellence in Student/Faculty Collaborative Research, it is  imperative that state-of-the-art research facilities be funded  and maintained. Towards these ends, the State of Wisconsin has  recently committed $343,000 to renovate exist ing space to house a  new EM center and the new facility, completed in February, 1996  has a room devoted exclusively to development of a modern  analytical TEM laboratory. In addition, UWEC is pledging an  additional $256,311 for purchase of the proposed equipment  indicating again the level of commitment on this campus to the  proposed program. The combined university contribution to this  laboratory including the remodeling will be ~ $600,000. We are  seeking $269,953 from NSF to complete equipping the laboratory  facility.          The new TEM and associated equipment will add the following  capabilities to the current laboratory: (1) TEM microanalysis,  including accurate immunocytochemical localization, (2) ability  to perform higher resolution studies (ten-fold increase in  resolution over current TEM) and image crystalline structures  with atomic resolution, (3) video display for instruction and  demonstration, (4) video capture of digitized images for display  and image analysis, and (5) improved access to electron  microscopy for school and community groups. A surprising number  of current science majors indicate that summer programs and  school year visits to the university influenced their career  decisions. Acquisition of this equipment will allow safe,  effective training and research in EM to continue at UWEC for the  next 20 years. Students from UWEC will have experience using  state-of-the-art equipment, whether they are bound for graduate  school, professional school, or simply a science literate life in  the private sector.",
