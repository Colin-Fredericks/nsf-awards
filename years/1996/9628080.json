 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628080  Cole    This grant provides $113,487 as one-half support  of the costs of acquiring a stable isotope ratio  mass spectrometer (SIRMS) with a dual inlet system  and a Kiel device for automated carbonate sample  introduction.  The PI's research involves  deciphering high resolution records of climate  change indicated by variations in the carbon and  oxygen isotopic signatures recorded in biogenic  carbonates including corals, foraminifera and  mollusc shells.  The primary focus of research to  be conducted utilizing this mass spectrometer will  be on analyses of the del 18-O recorded in  massive, scleractinian coral skeletons as high  resolution indicators of variability in tropical  sea surface temperatures.  These corals grow  rapidly and can live for periods as long as 800  years and thus offer a unique, high resolution  record of climate variability over decadal to  centurian time-scales and can aid our  understanding of coupled ocean-atmospheric systems  such as the El Ni o/Southern Oscillation that has  global significance in determining patterns of  precipitation and thus is relevant to worldwide  agriculture and flooding hazard mitigation.  To  effectively and efficiently analyze the carbon and  oxygen isotopic ratios recorded in biogenic  carbonates at sub-monthly resolutions requires a  sensitive mass spectrometer capable of analyzing  samples in the 100-600 micro-gram size range with  high throughput.  Analyses of upwards of 10,000  samples per year including sufficient replicates  so as to ensure regional fidelity can be required  for century-scale records.  The inclusion of a  Kiel device in this acquisition will allow  unassisted and sequential sample introduction of  up to 74 samples, thus allowing for nighttime  operations which are essential for maintaining the  high throughput necessary for these high-  resolution studies.  ***",
