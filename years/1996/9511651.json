 "awd_abstract_narration": "Derivation of the explicit analytic equation of motion for  deformable celestial bodies, falling at relativistic speeds  in strong gravitational fields, is the goal of this work.  Dr. Nordtvedt's work builds on his fully covariant, strong  field action principle for the motion of bodies with  spherical extensiol, said action principle having been  conjectured and made plausible by exact calculations of 1/c2  order motion of such extended bodies.  This action principle  for extended bodies also reveals the route for including  consideration of body deformation on the relativistic  motion.    Any progress which can be made to more accurately describe  the motion of realistic bodies falling in strong  gravitational fields will aid in the a-priori calculation of  gravitational radiation wave form pulses from the type of  astrophysical events which have a likelihood of being  observed by gravity wave detectors being constructed through  National Science Foundation support.  The sensitivity at  which detection of the weakest gravity wave signals will be  made depends on the precision to which the signal shape  theoretical templates can be made.",
