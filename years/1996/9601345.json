 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601345  Jung    Systems-level analyses of the neuronal control of rhythmic  behavioral patterns in animals is not far advanced.  Most of  the earlier work on this problem is based on mapping of  neuronal interactions.  It has become evident that  mathematical and computational techniques will be required  to achieve a quantitative understanding of central nervous  function. The long term goal of the research funded by this  grant is to understand the interactions between the neural  circuitry in the brain and spinal cord that underlie motor  control.  Specific experiments are to examine the nature of  variability in the locomotor rhythms of primitive intact  vertebrates and to examine the response of these animals to  external perturbations.   Analytical techniques include  linear and non-linear signal analysis to find temporal  correlations, variability, stability, and intersegmental  coordination.  In addition, techniques from dynamical  systems theory, such as bifurcation analysis and  perturbation analysis, will be used to analyze the behavior  of neural network models of  the central pattern generator.    This research is expect to lead to an improved understanding  of the coordinating mechanisms that are used by biological  systems.  Such improved understanding of biological control  systems could also be the basis for the development of new,  biologically-inspired methodologies to control of cyclic  processes in engineering systems, for example, for robotic  locomotion.",
