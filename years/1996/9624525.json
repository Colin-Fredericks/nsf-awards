 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal deals with open issues in ATM networks and mixed ATM wireless   networks.  The work will include four topics: 1) Scheduling in the ATM   environment.  Work will focus on generalizing their real-time scheduling   algorithm, which minimizes the weighted loss at an ATM node, to a network   and to non-real time traffic.  2) Traffic modeling and performance analysis   for bandwidth allocation in ATM networks.  Work will extend their   analytical techniques to capture the queueing behavior over an ATM network   for fairly general doubly stochastic arrival processes and address issues   of self-similarity, transient analysis, and dynamic bandwidth allocation.   3) Video transmission over ATM networks. The PI will capture cell-jitter in   order to size the receiver buffer appropriately and determine the startup   delay.  Further work will include error-concealment for transmitting video   traffic in a lossy ATM medium and ways in which flow control can be   implemented on non-real time traffic to improve the overall utilization in   the network. 4) Integration of wireless and ATM environments.  Work will   focus on ways in which dynamic bandwidth control can be accomplished, and   flow control and admission control in the mixed wireless environment can be   addressed.",
