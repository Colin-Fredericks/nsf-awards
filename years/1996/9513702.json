 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors E. Pfender and J. Heberlein and two U.S. graduate students from the High Temperature Laboratory of the University of Minnesota to collaborate in engineering research with Professor Nutsch and his group at the Surface Technology Division of the Technical University of Ilmenau, Germany.  They propose to quantify the major advantages and disadvantages of two coating technologies, direct current (D.C.) and high frequency (R.F.) plasma spraying.  Their detailed comparison will include characterization of both  D.C. and R.F. plasma jets through a number of techniques.  They will prepare metallic and non-metallic coatings with both methods, then compare the microstructure, adhesion, hardness and surface roughness of the resulting coatings.  The collaborative arrangement joins the expertise of the University of Minnesota group in D.C. spray technologies with the German group's expertise in R.F. plasma spraying.  They will coordinate their complementary experimental and modeling research on the two methods, and exchange both samples and junior members of each research group in order to maximize the comparability of their research     Thermal plasma spraying is a widely used technology that can deposit an increasing variety of coatings, even superconducting materials, on many types of  substrates.  In spite of the extent of its applications in industries as diverse as aerospace and biomedical implants,  some of the fundamental phenomena of the plasma spray process remain poorly understood.   Both of the dominant methods being studied in this collaboration have advantages and disadvantages.  The results of this detailed characterization will provide guidelines for choosing the most appropriate spray process for a particular application.",
