 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program will   provide a grant to Dr. Milton R. Smith of Michigan State University to   explore the reactivity of boron containing reagents with transition metal   complexes.  He will study the reactivity of metal-olefin complexes with   borane reagents emphasizing selective transformations relevant to   hydroboration chemistry. He will develop synthetic routes to, and   fundamental reaction chemistry of, single and double bonds between boron   and early transition metals.  He will also explore the oxidative and   metathetical reactivity of boron-boron bonds with transition metal   complexes.  He proposes experiments to induce catalytic conversion of   olefins to vinyl boranes, to define the mechanisms of these reactions, to   prepare compounds with metal-boron double bonds, and to investigate the   involvement of B-B bonds in redox and metathetical reactions.  The principal relevance of this work is tied to metal-catalyzed   hydroboration of alkenes in organic chemistry.  The addition of borane   reagents to unsaturated organic molecules is an extremely versatile   reaction, particularly because the conversion of borane groups to various   functional groups generally proceeds with retention of the   stereochemistry at the carbon. This project pushes the frontier of   hydroboration chemistry.  It is expected to uncover relevant mechanism   information which will aid in the discovery of new catalysts with new and   different properties.  The discovery of a boron metal double bond would   be a major achievement in this area and could have far reaching   implications.",
