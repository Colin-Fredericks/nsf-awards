This new science center is the central component of  mixed-use redevelopment effort at the 45-acre Roebling Industrial  complex in Trenton, New Jersey.  Phase One includes the development  of a 3200 sq. ft. visitor's center which is scheduled to open in  the Spring of 1997.  The IFSC will develop \"Pathways to Science and  Technology: An Informal Science Learning System, which is to be an  innovative, interactive computer-based system of activities  designed to stimulate self-directed and continuous learning.  It  will have a strong regional/community base, will leverage resources  from local academic, industrial, and educational institutions, and  will be disseminated broadly via state-of-the-art  telecommunications technology.    The planning activities will include front-end evaluation of the  needs and interests of the community, meetings of the advisory  committee, the development of plans for the \"Pathfinders\" software  program, and development of plans for the overall evaluation of the  project.   t the end of the twelve-month planning period they will  have designs and cost-estimates for the interactive activities and  a general plan for the Visitor center.  The value that this  planning grant adds to their effort is support to bring nationally  recognized leaders in exhibit development and informal learning to  the planning sessions.",
