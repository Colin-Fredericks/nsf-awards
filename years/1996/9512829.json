Dawes, University of South Florida,  and Dr. Daniel Robledo, Centro de Investigaciones y de  Estudios Avanzados del I.P.N., Mexico, on the physiology and  cultivation of the seaweed Gracilaria cornea.  The species,  occurring along the Yucatan coast of Mexico and in the lower  Keys of Florida, contains a commercially important  phycocolloid, agar.  As a result of experiments to be  conducted, strains showing high growth rates, useful  morphotypes, and high yields of quality agar will be  selected.  It is expected that the information resulting  from the proposed research will benefit those countries  where algae are used as food or as raw material for the agar  industries.    There is a potential need for developing new sources of high  quality agar in the world.  More than 80% of the raw  material for agar used in the U.S. is imported from distant  countries.  Thus, there is an important demand for agar from  adjacent countries such as Mexico.  This project, combining  the expertise of the U.S. scientist in seaweed physiology  and cultivation, with the knowledge of local seaweeds of his  Mexican counterpart, may lead to the development of a new  seaweed mariculture industry, that could provide the raw  material for North American agar production.  ***",
