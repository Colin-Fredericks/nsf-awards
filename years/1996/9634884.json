 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634884  Clarke   This minority research planning grant focuses on research for developing decision models for integrated production and distribution planning in large manufacturing companies, characterized by multiple plants that are geographically dispersed, multiple products that can be produced at different locations, multiple period planning horizons, significant transportation-shipping costs, and intermediate tiers of distribution and supply.  The decision support integrated production and planning system must determine (1) which product to produce at which plant, (2) what quantity to produce each period, (3) where to hold inventory, (4) from which plants will a customer receive shipment, (5) what route and what mode of transportation will the shipment take. The methodology focuses on mixed integer programming.  During the planning year, a particular application from the gas industry will be studied, an extensive literature review undertaken, some preliminary formulations will be developed.   The research problem addressed is important and interesting.  Given the broad scope of the problem addressed, a planning grant is most appropriate to allow the PI to investigate the area  in more detail so that a focused proposal can result.",
