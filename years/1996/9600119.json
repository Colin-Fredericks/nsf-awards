 "awd_abstract_narration": "960019  Fannjiang    This project concerns the large scale behavior of particle dispersion in   incompressible fluid flows. On large scales, particles evolve diffusively  or nondiffusively depending on the fluid flows. One of the focuses of this   project is the sharp criteria for the diffusive regime. Novel variational   methods have been employed to obtain such criteria for steady flows.   The extension of the variational methods to unsteady flows and weakly  compressible flows are proposed. Furthermore, within the diffusive regime,  the influence of fluid velocities on  the transport coefficients, the   effective diffusivity, is of both practical and theoretical importance,   particularly when the molecular diffusivity is small. As such, the fluid   velocities typically enhance the effective diffusivity by orders of magnitude.   The variational methods have been successfully applied to obtain nontrivial   power laws for convection enhanced diffusion in two-dimensional  steady flows.   It remains to be extended to analyze turbulent diffusion in three dimensional   random flows and chaotic diffusion in two dimensional unsteady flows. The   variational methods also provide naturally a framework for numerical   computations of the transport coefficients to which the well established   numerical methods for symmetric problems can now be applied. In the   non-diffusive regime, being an effective tool for  analyzing physical    quantities for finite volume, the variational methods are potentially useful   in studying anomalous diffusion in the infinite volume limit. Finally, it is   of enormous interest to understand  the diffusion time scale and other   transient time scales. The martingale method and the extension of the   contractivity estimates (for symmetric processes) to the singularly  non-symmetric convection-diffusion processes are proposed to study the time   scales problem.  %%%    Since the great scientists A. Einstein and N. Wiener laid the theoretical   foundation for the study of the  Brownian motion, great effort has been made   to understand the combined effect of the Brownian motion on the molecular   scale and the fluid motion on the ordinary scale. Such problem is also of   enormous practical importance since most of the mass and heat transfer   processes in chemical engineering, ground water contamination and global   change in the atmosphere involve both kinds of motion. As it turns out, the   typical smallness in  size of molecular Brownian motion, and chaos and   randomness in convective motion give rise to numerous interesting phenomena   on large scales such as convection enhanced diffusion where the size of the   Brownian motion  is greatly enhanced, multiple scales where the transport   processes behave differently on different scales, and anomalous diffusion for   which an appropriate description is yet to be found. This project proposes a   rigorous  framework and effective methods for studying the convection-  diffusion problem, which has yielded many important results. This and other   hopeful research outcomes will add to our fundamental understanding  of one   of the most basic transport processes affecting our lives.  ***",
