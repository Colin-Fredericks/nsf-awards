 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miami University proposes a systemic project to convert current research-based educational initiatives into an expanded and comprehensive model program of `research-rich`' undergraduate education at the University.  The proposed project is part of the national undergraduate research movement, and will contribute important concrete outcomes to the growing base of that movement.  Specifically, the project will produce:  1) a model science curriculum in which research-rich inquiry-based learning permeates the curriculum, and in which students are encouraged in a mode of learning appropriate for their lifelong learning, 2) a model infrastructure in which students and faculty are carefully prepared for, and supported within, a variety of undergraduate research experiences, and 3) an expanded set of undergraduate research opportunities, including interdisciplinary group projects.  These aspects of a model program will be disseminated to other institutions through presentations at national meetings and publications.  In addition, the project will initiate an ambitious longitudinal study of student research participants' development as independent learners.  We propose to measure the latter development, and believe that the results will be of national importance and interest.  This project builds upon significant research-intensive educational undertakings at the University, namely:  1) a distinctive new undergraduate research initiative, the Miami Undergraduate Summer Scholars Program; 2) an academic-year undergraduate research grant program; 3) numerous inquiry-based learning projects; 4) honors program thesis projects; 5) `capstone experiences` required by our new liberal education program; and 6) summer research participation funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and NSF.  In the Undergraduate Summer Scholars Program, one hundred students from twenty-five departments participated in full-time summer (1995) research with faculty mentors.  An evaluation has shown that the program produced educational experiences which were rated overwhelmingly by participants as `more significant than other educational experiences`.  This proposal to the NSF would enhance and evaluate research-intensive education throughout the science curriculum within the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, Microbiology, Botany, Zoology, Psychology, and Geology.  In view of the centrality of the project to the University's mission, substantial cost sharing is committed.",
