Computational techniques (exact diagonalization and  quantum Monte Carlo) address the many-body correlations of  the electronic systems.  In part,  the investigators are  testing the assumptions of an explanation of angle-resolved  photoemission and transport data that they recently  proposed.  They are using their model to calculate  photoemission spectra, which they will then compare with  experiments.  If successful, these projects will clarify  several aspects of the anomalous properties of high  temperature superconductors.  These investigators are  collaborating with others at the National High Field Magnet  Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida, who are investigating  these materials in strong fields both theoretically and  experimentally.  %%%  The broad goal of this project is to carry out a comparison  between calculations using models of strongly interacting  electrons and experimental results in high-temperature  superconductors, both in the normal and superconducting  states.  The community recognizes the investigators as  experts in the computational techniques that address the  many-body correlations of the electronic systems.  In part,  the investigators are testing the assumptions of an  explanation that they recently proposed for experiments that  involve (a) the emission of photons (such as light) from  these materials and (b) the transport of electrons.  Using  their model, with its assumptions, they calculate what the  experiments would give if their models were correct and then  compare with experiments to test how close their model is to  real materials.  If successful, these projects will clarify  several aspects of the anomalous properties of high  temperature superconductors.  These investigators are  collaborating wit h others at the National High Field Magnet  Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida, who are investigating  these materials in strong fields both theoretically and  experimentally.  ***",
