 "awd_abstract_narration": "As electronic components decrease in size and increase in functional complexity, packaging becomes a very important issue. The requirements of electrical, thermal, mechanical, and material considerations in electronic packaging make it a highly interdisciplinary subject, in both academia and industry. This is one key technology in which U.S. industry must maintain its competitiveness in the global economy. To provide technical training to undergraduate students, this department is establishing an interdisciplinary Electronic Packaging and Materials Laboratory (EPM Lab).   The courses and laboratory are highly interdisciplinary. The project covers not only several subareas in electrical engineering, namely circuits and systems, microwave engineering, reliability and testing, and measurement and computational techniques, but also thermal and mechanical analyses of packaging and materials. This curriculum is training a new breed of engineers that are capable of integrating technologies from various engineering disciplines and enabling them to contribute to U.S. economic competitiveness in the area of EPM, particularly to the rapidly growing regional EPM industry. The laboratory can be housed in the new Electrical Engineering/Computer Science and Engineering Building to be completed in the fall of 1996.",
