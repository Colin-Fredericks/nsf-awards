 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an application for two items that will allow  state-of-the-art data analysis and image processing: a Leica/Leitz TCS  4D-UV scanning laser confocal microscope, and a Power Macintosh-based  workstation with image processing and image analysis software. The new  microscope will be housed in the Basic Science Microscope Facility. It  will serve investigators from more than five basic research departments  at the Johns Hopkins Medical School. Our six major users require  confocal microscopy for the following purposes: high resolution  colocalization of fluorescent labels in fixed cells and tissues; clear  differentiation of signals in cells stained with multiple labels,  simultaneous recording of multiple fluorochromes for accurate  registration and efficient processing; excitation at both UV and  visible wavelengths; and 3D views of complex structures in cells,  embryos and neural tissues. The Leica/Leitz TCS 4D-UV microscope best  fits these needs. The Leica has (i) an upright microscope body equipped  with the best optics for DIC and confocal fluorescence microscopy, (ii)  multiple wavelength excitation provided by an Ar/Kr laser, and UV  excitation provided by an argon ion laser, (iii) simultaneous  collection and display of DIC and 3 fluorescence images, (iv) the most  accurate collection of either XZ or XY images with resolution in the  Z-axis documented at 360 nm, and (v) a convenient and efficient  multi-user environment. Images will be stored on hard drives or  magneto-optical drives accessible to all laboratories in the medical  school via our EtherNet network. Volume rendering, 3D reconstruction,  and other image analyses will be performed on a separate Power  Macintosh-based workstation located in the same Microscope Facility,  using software such as VoxelView and Adobe Photoshop. The Johns Hopkins  Medical School currently has one old confocal microscope, which does  not have these features. The Leica confocal microscope described in  this proposal will give all of our use rs access to modern image and  data analysis, and will be time-efficient, dependable, and easy to use.",
