 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9631351   Wegman      This research focuses on the development of a synthetic environment to be   used as a tool for exploring data.  The synthetic environment will be   constructed from and involve the integration of a number of exploratory   data analysis tools some of which have already been created, some of   which will be created under the scope of this research.  Topic areas being   explored include 1) a fractal-based grand tour, 2) 1-dimensional grand tour   for images and random fields, 3) visualization using two- and three-  dimensional wavelets, 4) exploratory signal analysis, and 5) visualization of   huge data sets.  Mathematical issues being addressed include a new method   for constructing grand tours so that all the tour spends equal time in all   regions of the multidimensional space and a new methodology for   integrating multivariate (multispectral) image data into a single image.    Computational issues being addressed include the establishment of a new   metaphor for data exploration involving the creation of a data world and   portals through regions of it.  The research uses three-dimensional models   extensively.         %%%   This research focuses on the exploitation of virtual reality techniques for   the analysis of statistical and stochastic data.  The thesis of this research is   that virtual reality offers a better technology for human-computer   interaction as it relates to exploratory analysis than does the desktop   metaphor.  Virtual reality technology not only offers a much more   compelling visual focus than does a standard computer screen, but also a   more complete engagement of the investigator with the data world.  The   major thrust of this research is to combine scientific visualization,   exploratory data analysis and virtual reality into a new technology for   exploring data.  The plan is to create a data world made of analysis   modules that can be accessed directly simply by moving from one domain   within the data world to another domain via port als. As one moves   seamlessly from one domain to the next through a portal, the current data   set will be ported into the appropriate analysis or representation technique.   The data explorer will be able to interact with the data in the current   representation, either directly and/or by means of icons.  The main task of   this project will be to  create a total synthetic environment for the   exploratory analysis of data. The impact of this work should be wide   ranging.  The interactive focus on high-dimensional data analysis has   immediate impact on settings where large amounts of multiattribute data   are collected.  Settings such as biotechnology (e.g. human genome),   NASA's EOS-DIS and similar projects (e.g. monitoring global change),   manufacturing settings in which many parameters are monitored in both the   design and production processes, and materials science where optimization   involving a large number of  parameters of materials mixtures are examples   of data amenable to the type of analyses being facilitated with this research.   ***",
