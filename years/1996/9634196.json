 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634196  Bergbreiter  This  grant  will explore several new aspects of  polyolefin  surface  modification. The initial stages  of  the  proposed  project will extend prior studies on \"responsive\" surfaces -  surfaces  that  reversibly  change hydrophilicity,  adhesion  and/or  reactivity  in  response  to  external  physical  or  chemical stimuli.  By incorporating several different  sorts  of   spectroscopic  probes  and  by  chemically  tuning  the  structure of polymer grafts, it will be possible to test how  to   chemically   control  and  manipulate   solvation   and  reactivity  at  polymer  surfaces. This  chemistry  will  be  explored  with  linear  brush-like grafts.   Second,  a  new  approach  to  surface grafting using hyperbranched  polymers  will  be  studied. Preliminary work has already  shown  that  hyperbranched   grafting  chemistry  can  generate   heavily  functionalized thin (10 - 150 nm) films of polymer grafts at  surfaces.   This  chemistry can also  be  used  to  generate  responsive   surfaces   and  can,  by  design,   incorporate  spectroscopic  labels  either in the  graft  phase,  at  the  graft/solvent  interface  or at  the  graft  phase/substrate  interface.   Finally, known metallocene  catalysts  used  in  polypropylene  polymerization make terminally functionalized  stereoregular  polypropylene  oligomers  readily  available.  Such   oligomers   can   be   synthetically   modified   and  characterized  using chemistry previously  used  to  prepare  terminally  functionalized  polyethylene  oligomers.   These  terminally functionalized polypropylene oligomers will  then  be  used  to  prepare  surface functionalized  polypropylene  films  by  a  blending  approach  whose  utility  has   been  established  using polyethylene oligomers and a polyethylene  host polymer.  %%%  This  grant  is in the area of polymer synthesis for  design  and   modification  of  surfaces.   This  new  approach   to  polypropylene  functionalization can be used  with  the  new  sort s of chemical grafting chemistry to be developed in this  proposal and in prior work. The result will be a new way  to  efficiently surface modify polypropylene.  ***",
