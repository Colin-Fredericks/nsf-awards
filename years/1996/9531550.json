 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide opportunities for 16 undergraduate  students each summer to participate in the Research Experiences  in Molecular Biology program at the University of Minnesota.  This program has two parts.  First all students spend three weeks  learning basic molecular biology techniques in an intensive  laboratory course.  This course will cover basic principles of  gene regulation and will provide students with the most current  information on specific techniques as well as background  terminology and concepts.  Following the course, each student  spends the next seven weeks completing an independent research  project under the direction of one of the 50 faculty mentors  affiliated with the program, all of whom are conducting research  using Recombinant DNA technology.  The students' research  experience will be supplemented by weekly student seminars and  evening workshops to strengthen the quality of future  applications to graduate programs.  Students will prepare a  summary of their research project in the form of a display or a  poster session at the conclusion of the program.       This award will foster the continued education and training  of individuals who will be part of our next generation of basic  researchers in the biological sciences.",
