The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions.    This award will support a twenty-four month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Kendrick L. Marr (under the  sponsorship of Dr. Richard I. Ford) of the University of  Michigan to work with Professor Pei Sheng-Ji at Kunming  Institute of Botany in Yunnan, China.  Funding for this  project is being provided by the U.S.-China Program.        The purpose of this project is to investigate the  ethnobotany, domestication and genetic variability of  Momordica charantia L. (bitter-melon) and various other  species such as the wax gourd and the loofa.  The edible  fruit are harvested from the wild, swidden farms, or home  gardens, by the Xishuangbanna people.  These species belong  to the Cucurbitaceae (Squash family), one of the most  important plant families in China for fresh vegetables as  well as medicinal plants.  The luffa and bitter-melon are  important because they have a thick wax coating which  protects them during the hot summer months and allows them  to be stored for up to a year and a half.  Documentation of  indigenous knowledge of crop plant varieties is important  not only to maintain genetic diversity, but because this  knowledge encourages rational regional development policies  in rural areas.    ***",
