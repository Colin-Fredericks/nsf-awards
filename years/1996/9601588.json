 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Kansas (KU) is establishing a national                            computational  laboratory for the analysis of biodiversity and environmental  information. The Kansas Environmental Informatics Lab (KEIL) will  apply high-performance visualization and database systems to  computationally-intensive environmental and biodiversity research  problems. KEIL unites a cross-disciplinary campus consortium of  systematists, ecologists and computer scientists with  specializations in visualization, database and high-speed  communications organized around a common research focus of  biodiversity and ecological data analysis. We are collaborating  with the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) on research  related to real-time access to terabyte sized environmental data  archives over gigabit networks. KU is making a fundamental  commitment to KEIL: a $300,000 cash match to the proposal  ($150,000 from KU and $150,000 from the Kansas Technology  Enterprise Corporation); a new, full-time position for the  Director of KEIL (PI); $100,000 for startup costs; the four-year,  $1~0,000 Self Family Graduate Fellowship in Environmental  Informatics, and space and administrative support in the Natural  History Museum for KEIL.    KEIL will be the first facility in the United States totally  devoted to research questions in biodiversity and environmental  informatics. These research questions are grand challenges-- we  will demonstrate the effective use of high-performance computing  leveraged against a 300-year investment in biodiversity  documentation and burgeoning environmental data resources.  Research themes to be investigated by KEIL include:         Integration of heterogeneous environmental and biological    museum data sets       Predictive modeling of species spatial distribution based on  real-time aggregation of species occurrence in combination with  climate and geophysical data, as well as models of species  distributions under climate change scena rios       Database architectures for access and analysis of very large  environmental data archives, in collaboration with SDSC       Visualization methodologies for morphometric and  phylogenetic data       On-the-fly visualizations of landscape, terrain, species  distribution and climate data, integrating views at scales  ranging from specific collection points to global perspectives.       On-line access, user interface, and electronic publication  systems for disseminating biodiversity information using VRML,  SGML, HGML    These research themes will parallel KU training activities in  computer science and biological research. Several academic units  and programs at KU are involved in ecological biodiversity and  computer science research and will use the facility. Students at  Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence are being trained  in these programs. KEIL instrumentation will also be the platform  for: research on national museum community architectures;  training on community solutions and applications; and recruitment  of students and professionals to build and maintain a national  biodiversity information infrastructure.    To support the research mission of KEIL, we are requesting a  four-processor SGI Onyx server. The Onyx is engineered to  function simultaneously as a high performance compute,  visualization and I/O (database) server. Three SIG Indigo2  workstations connected by an ATM work group LAN will provide  additional seats for faculty, postdoctoral fellows, staff and  students for development and visualization work. An ATM network  to SDCS and other data centers will complete the architecture.",
