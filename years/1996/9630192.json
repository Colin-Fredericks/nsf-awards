 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Judith Eglin, Department of Chemistry, Mississippi State University,   is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the Chemistry Division under a Research Planning Grant to study the   synthesis and reactivity of tungsten complexes.  The reactivity of   multiply-bonded ditungsten and dimolybdenum complexes with chlorinated   hydrocarbons will be explored, with the ultimate goal of catalytic   dehalogenation.  Mononuclear tungsten complexes will also be investigated   for their potential as precursors to conducting materials.  These   planning activities will advance Dr. Eglin's career by providing a basis   for preparing a competitive NSF research proposal subsequent to the   completion of this Research Planning Grant.   The chemistry of tungsten and molybdenum is unique in that these metals   tend to form complexes in which two of these metals are bound to one   another through multiple bonds.  The reactivity of these compounds with   chlorinated hydrocarbons suggests their potential use in the   dehalogenation of these environmentally harmful molecules.  Futhermore,   the unique geometry of tungsten lends itself to the study of conducting   materials, which could have important industrial applications.",
