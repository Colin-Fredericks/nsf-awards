 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of the large student response to the Molecular Genetics and Microbial Ecology courses in the Biology curriculum, this project designed a collaborative project centered around the theory of the two courses and the combined expertise of faculty and students. The pilot project included the isolation and purification of coliphages from sewage followed by enzyme restriction analyses of coliphage DNA. Newly purchased instruments now enhance and expand this project to include the isolation, restriction mapping, and polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA. Students are also able to conduct qualitative analyses with the acquisition of DNA sequencing capabilities and quantitative analyses using an optical densitometer. With the new equipment, students are able to conduct modern techniques including PCR amplification of DNA, Southern blotting, probe hybridization, DNA sequencing, and chemiluminescent probing. These capabilities can greatly increase students' understanding of genetic theory and phylogeny and can also enable students to learn how to generate molecular markers to be used in genetic and microbial investigations. A knowledge of these techniques is essential to the success of students in their research projects, in their future studies, and in an increasingly technical world.",
