The   workshops will address the current understanding of the links between sea   surface temperature anomalies in the Pacific and climate forecasts for the   region; past experiences with applications of ENSO-related rain forecasts   through programs like the IRICP Pilot Program; identification of the key   sectors in agriculture and water resources that could benefit from the   forecasts; discussion of data availability and accessibility in the region;   training and education aspects; and the dissemination of results.  This proposal includes participants from Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.   Scientific advice will be provided from experts at UCLA and Texas A&M   University from the United States.  These countries are members of the IAI,   an initiative to stimulate global change research among the scientific   institutions of the Americas.  The National Science Foundation is the   designated U.S. Government agency to carry out the U.S. responsibilities   within the IAI.  %%%  This proposal requests support for a series of workshops in order to   organize a program of cooperation between universities in Argentina,   Brazil, and  Uruguay for the study of the climate of Southeastern South   America and the impact of interannual variability, specifically the ENSO   phenomenon, on the water resources and agriculture of the region.
