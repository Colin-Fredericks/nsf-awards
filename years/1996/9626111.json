The homotopy type of related complexes on which the automorphism  groups act, for example the complex of free factors of a free group, will  also be investigated.  Another problem which will be studied is to  determine the homotopy type of the space of all embeddings of a link in  3-space, extending known results for knots.  In particular, it should be  possible to answer Kontsevich's question whether this space has finite  homotopy type.       In more general terms, this involves determining all the essentially  different ways of removing unnecessary tangles from a knotted piece of  string or from several pieces which are knotted and linked together.  With regard to the other part of the project, automorphisms of free  groups play a fundamental role in group theory (the general study of  symmetry) somewhat analogous to matrices in linear algebra, and the goal  is to understand just how close this parallel is:  When one takes a  geometric view of both sorts of algebraic objects, is the picture  qualitatively the same, or qualitatively different?  ***",
