University of Virginia    Special Project: NCSTRL: A National Computer Science Technical Report Library    This project proposes to integrate two successful existing on-line computer science technical report servers into a single service called the Networked Computer Science Technical Report Service, or NCSTRL.  The project will be carried out by a consortium of six universities which have been involved in the development of the two existing services, WATERS (Wide Area TEchnical Report Service) and Dienst, developed in the ARPA sponsored CS-TR project.  The technologies developed in these earlier projects will be integrated and extended to provide the new service.    After the completion of the integration effort, a major promotional effort is planned to increase the number of participating institutions.  To that end of the endorsement of the Computing Research Association has been secured.  The latter represents the PhD granting computer science departments in North America as well as several industrial laboratories that engage in fundamental research.    These activities are expected to lead to a service that will improve computer science research while providing cost savings to computer science departments.  It will be a valuable resource to the nation, and can be reached quickly and at a remarkably low cost.  ***",
