 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mumford  9615444       The problem of vision can be studied from many points of  view: from an engineering, system-building problem to a problem  in biology and psychology.  The investigator seeks to understand  vision from the perspective of Bayesian statistics, as one of  modeling and learning the `priors' of visual signals and of  finding algorithms for efficiently sampling the posterior  probability distribution on the unobserved 3D world variables.  More specifically, he constructs a larger, more inclusive,  probability model for vision based on a pyramid architecture that  combines low-level texture segmentation with high-level object  recognition.  He seeks more effective algorithms for sampling the  posterior or making `near-MAP (maximum a posteriori probability)'  estimates by combining region growing and genetic algorithm  ideas.  He also seeks to model the neurophysiology of the primate  visual system, using the insights gained by this statistical  analysis.  He continues the analysis of cortical functioning  based on single/multiple-cell recordings, especially with models  of cortical areas V1 and M1, based on information multiplexed via  synfire-like chains.       The investigator believes that logic-based methods for  solving problems in artificial intelligence are reaching their  limits and that Bayesian statistics is the best tool for modeling  how we think.  The ability to see, to transform raw measurements  of light in a camera or on the retina into a symbolic description  of the world being seen, is an extremely challenging problem for  these methods.  Vision is the perfect test case, especially, for  massively parallel computation because of the huge size of its  data.  In the last 5 years, the technology for processing the data  streams produced by video cameras in real time has become  available and the challenge of building general purpose computer  vision systems may now be within reach.  On the theoretical side,  the understanding of human and animal vision systems has   complemented the engineering of artificial vision systems in a  remarkable synergy.  In neurophysiology, the possibility of  massively parallel neural recordings is now available and may  lead to understanding how mammalian cortex uses parallelism so  successfully.  This project seeks to attack the problem of vision  from these two perspectives.",
