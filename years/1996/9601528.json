 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will be used to acquire equipment with which to  conduct neurophysiological experiments. The equipment will  consist of a vibration isolation table, micromanipulators,  oscilloscope, appropriate amplifiers, tape and chart recorders,  and stimulator.        The research conducted with this equipment will determine  the precise influences circulating hormones have on a  well-defined neural network. The preparation used will be the  Stomatogastric Nervous System (STNS) of the spiny lobster  Panulirus interruptus. The STNS controls all movements associated  with the stomach. In lobsters, chewing occurs internally, in the  gastric mill region of the stomach. The stomatogastric ganglion  (STG) in particular produces two distinct motor patterns  associated with the stomach movements.        Molting in lobsters is controlled by two types of  circulating hormones - a collection of steroid hormones  collectively called ecdysteroids, and a peptide hormone called  Molt Inhibiting Hormone (MIH). During the molt cycle, the  circulating levels of MIH decrease, and this triggers a rise in  ecdysteroids (Figure 1). Molting occurs once ecdysteroid levels  have reached a peak and begin to decline. The lobster stops  eating prior to molting and sheds the lining of the stomach  during the molt. My working hypothesis thus is that MIH plays an  essential role in maintaining the day-to-day functioning of the  STNS. I further expect that declining levels of MIH, or  increasing levels of ecdysteroid, will initially inhibit the  motor patterns of the STG. The subsequent drop in ecdysteroid  levels that triggers the molt will in turn elicit a novel motor  pattern associated with shedding the lining of the stomach.  Molting in crustaceans can be induced by removing the eyestalks  of juvenile animals. The eyestalks contain the neurosecretory  cells that release MIH. Eyestalk ablation leads to an increase in  ecdysteroids. Because the animal itself is making the hormones,  the appropriate ecdysteroids are pro duced in the proper ratios.        I will use anatomical and physiological techniques to  examine the effects of circulating hormones on the STNS. My  specific aims will be: Aim 1: Determine the precise  concentrations of circulating ecdysteroids during the molt cycle  in the spiny lobster. I have already initiated a collaboration  with Dr. D. Watson at the University of Alabama, Birmingham in  which he will run radioimmunoassays to determine the circulating  levels of ecdysteroids during induced molts. Serum samples will  be withdrawn from animals during various stages of the molt cycle  to determine the time-course for hormonal changes during molting.  Aim 2: Examine the change in expression of modulatory  neurotransmitters. A single result from an early experiment in  Cancer borealis suggests that the expression of certain  modulatory transmitters is downregulated during natural molts. I  will use anatomical and immunocytochemical techniques to measure  the expression of identified transmitter substances within the  STNS in eyestalk ablated and control animals. Aim 3: Examine  changes in STNS motor patterns and individual network neurons  prior to and during molts. To do this, I will use a combination  of intracellular and extracellular recordings to monitor rhythmic  motor patterns. Preliminary work will consist of extracellular  and intracellular monitoring of the STG motor patterns in  molt-induced and control animals. In later experiments, I will  use voltage clamp techniques to monitor changes in ionic  conductances in individual neurons. Aim 4: Characterize changes  in the effects of modulatory inputs to the motor pattern  generating network. Previous research I conducted suggests that  the effects of modulatory inputs to the STG is altered prior to a  spontaneous molt. I will use bath application of identified and  characterized neuromodulators as well as stimulation of  individual inputs to compare effects during and between molts.        The work will initially be conducted by myself  and 2 or 3  undergraduates. When CSU San Marcos begins its Master's degree  program in 1997, I hope to have at least 2 graduate students  (Masters) working in the lab. I also teach courses in Comparative  Physiology, Human Physiology, Neurobiology, and Endocrinology.  The equipment purchased with this grant will be used for  demonstrations in conjunction with these courses. California  State University at San Marcos has committed itself to offering a  program in the Biological Sciences that stresses the use of  modern equipment and the latest techniques. This commitment is  shown in part by the generous set-up funds for a University of  this size. However, the costs of acquiring the equipment  necessary of neurophysiological research are beyond the  capability of this institution. I therefore hope the NSF will  support the university in its endeavor.",
