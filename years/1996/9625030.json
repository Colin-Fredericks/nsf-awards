Developments from the proposed  computatinal research will be incorporated into an  existing undergraduate class in biomechanics by way of  introducing a laboratory-based computer project.  Other  teaching objectives include:  development of a new  graduate course in computational biomechanics;  introduction of research seminars for undergraduates and  graduates to assist in career choices; inclusion of  undergraduates and graduates in the proposed research;  expansion of research and teaching collaboration between  the Departments of Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley  and Orthopaedic Surgery at UCSF; and development of short  videos of experimental procedures and a CD ROM-based  textbook for the undergraduate biomechanics class.  The  major research goal is to develop a computational  framework for the study of the biomechanics of trabecular  bone and to use this framework to address a number of  fundamental issues on the mechanical behavior of this  complex biological tissue.  These issues are concerned  primarily with the relationships between the mechanical  behavior of tissue at the microstructural level vs. the  mechanical properties at the whole specimen level.  Specifically, relationships between locations of maximum  stress and strain within the specimen vs. trabecular  porosity and architecture will be investigated as well as  the failure modes that accompany these trends.  The  sensitivity of these trends to anatomic site, damage, bone  loss, variations in tissue properties, and loading modes  such as tension, compression, shear, off-axis, and multi-  axis will also be determined.  In collaboration with  researchers from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,  capabilities will be developed to perform three-  dimensional \"high-resolution\" finite element models of 40  trabecular bone spe cimens, using massively parallel  computation on models with up to 100 million elements.  The modeling technique will be prospectively validated  against experimental data for an additional 40 specimens  of trabecular bone taken from a range of anatomic sites.  Finite element parameter studies will then be performed to  address the specific research objectives.  Results from  this project will be relevant to biological form-function  relations in trabecular bone, aging, diseasae, trauma,  drug development, and artificial bone substitutes.  The  computational developments will also improve the ability  to perform stress analyses on any geometrically complex  structure, even beyond the realm of bioengineering.  ***",
