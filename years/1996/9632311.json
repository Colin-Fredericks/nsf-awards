 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research by Dr. William C. Trogler and Dr. Mark H.   Thiemens, both of the Chemistry Department, University of California, San   Diego, for investigation of reactions leading to the production of   nitrous oxide in the environment.  The project is jointly funded by the   Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program, Chemistry   Division, and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program, Division of Atmospheric   Sciences.  The goal of the research is to help resolve the global nitrous   oxide budget and the variation observed in nitrous oxide emissions and   its isotopic composition.  The role of atmospheric carbon aerosol   surfaces as catalysts for nitrous oxide formation will be investigated,   as will mechanistic and electrochemical studies of fundamental chemical   reactions that form nitrous oxide.  In all the experiments, nitrogen and   oxygen heavy atom isotope effects will be determined as a possible   indictor of reaction mechanism and for comparison to existing isotopic   data for atmospheric nitrous oxide.  Nitrous oxide is a source of stratospheric nitric oxide, an important   sink for ozone, and it can also contribute to greenhouse warming because   of its high warming potential.   As a byproduct of industrial development   with a long lifetime in the atmosphere, it is important to understand its   sources but they are not completely known.  In this research, some   potential sources for nitrous oxide will be examined.",
