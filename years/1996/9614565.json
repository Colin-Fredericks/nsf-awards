Although the IAI has held two meetings with Human Dimensions as one of the foci (at Taxco, Mexico, in 1993, jointly with the International Human Dimensions Programme; and at Bel=E9m, Brazil, in 1995), few proposals have been received by the IAI dealing with social, economic, or policy issues identified by these two meetings as critical to the success of the Institute.  This survey will identify the current researchers, their institutions, and their programs in order to target these groups for specific program announcements and more detailed information regarding the availability of funds and areas of research interest for the IAI.  The proposal will produce the following:  1) an overview paper of the IAI describing how environmental social science research can contribute to the IAI agenda; 2) a mailing list for the later use of the IAI Directorate in mailing Human Dimensions-related calls for proposals; 3) a tri-lingual survey (English, Spanish and Portuguese) addressing collaboration, resources and capabilities, electronic connectivity, and research interests and current projects; 4) a set of compiled survey results, and a preliminary analysis; and 5) a final report to the IAI Director and the IAI Scientific Advisory Committee.  If the survey has a good response rate, it could also serve as the basis for a formal IAI directory on Human Dimensions Research in the Americas.  %%%  The goal of this project is threefold:  to identify individuals and institutions developing research on issues related to the human and policy dimension of global cha nge in the region; to inform Latin American social scientists about the research mission and project funding opportunities of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI); and to involve them in the development of the IAI's Human Dimensions research agenda.

The IAI is an initiative to stimulate cooperative research on global change issues in the Americas.  The National Science Foundation is the designated U.S. Government agency to carry out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.  ***",
