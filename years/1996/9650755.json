 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new minor in Development of Environmental Resource Information is being established at this institution. This minor enables those persons involved in resource management to place resource information in the correct geographic location. It also provides an introduction to the legal aspects of boundaries and resource utilization. The minor combines surveying with software instruction in AutoCAD, Arc/Info, and land design software. This is balanced with boundary law, resource ecology, and environmental impact analysis. The last course in the minor is a project course in which all the material in the minor is integrated.    Geographic Information Systems (GIS) databases are becoming the standard planning tool. But when these databases are created, more than 50 percent of the effort and 90 percent of the cost is related to obtaining data in digital form. This minor helps students create the data in a cost-effective manner. Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers are a key technology in obtaining position information to correctly place and check the accuracy of GIS data. The project involves purchase of GPS receivers that will provide ground control for production of orthophotos (uniform scale aerial photographs), digital elevation model (DEM) data, and the requested cartographic data acquisition software. The DEM data can be used with requested land design software for earthwork, hydraulics, and hydrology calculations. A color printer and data collectors are also used in the minor.    Information on the minor can be publicized on a department web page, and links to the page can be requested from other web pages. Evaluations of the project can also be distributed there. Laboratory exercises developed for the minor will be offered to the NASA project to develop a National Remote Sensing Core Curriculum.",
