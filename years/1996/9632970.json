The objective of this  conference is to bring together an inter-disciplinary community of  researchers and practitioners to focus on the issues of learning  and instruction. The conference's theme \"Learning for the Real  World\" emphasizes the conference's goal of creating a community  that is capable of developing theories and designs that account for  the complexity of learning and teaching in real world settings. The  audience for this conference is researchers in the fields of  education, psychology, and computer science and practitioners from  formal education, informal education, and training.    Anticipated topics at ICLS '96 include:         Design. Design of learning and teaching environments,       including innovative curricula, multimedia, artificial       intelligence, and telecommunications technologies, and       classroom activity structures for supporting learning and       teaching.       Cognition. Models of the structures and processes of learning       and teaching by which organized knowledge, skills, and       understanding are acquired.       Social context. The social, organizational, and cultural       dynamics of learning and teaching across the range of formal       and informal settings.  ***",
