 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the   Chemistry Division, Crim will continue studies of the influence of   vibrational excitation on the course and rate of bimolecular chemical   reactions.  The current work will extend the investigations from the gas   into the liquid phase in the expectation of demonstrating selective   control of the course of a bimolecular reaction by preferentially   breaking a chosen bond.  In the proposed gas-phase studies visible or   infrared photons will excite vibrations of bonds which then react with   photolytically created atoms to form products.  Measuring the quantum   states of the products helps identify the pathways of the reactions   accelerated by the vibrational excitation.  In favorable cases, one can   cleave a bond preferentially.  Vibrationally driven bimolecular reactions   in liquids and supercritical fluids require ultrafast excitation of   reagents and detection of products.  Nonlinear light generation will   provide the excitation and absorption or coherent Raman scattering will   be used for detection.  Collaborations with a theoretician will allow   tests of dynamical theories and potential energy surface calculations.   In this research the outcome of a chemical reaction between a polyatomic   molecule and an atom is directly controlled by exciting the molecular   vibration of the bond which is expected to break in the course of the   reaction.  This expectation is based on the fact that the geometry change   that occurs in going from reactants to products first requires the   stretching of bonds similar to that which occurs during molecular   vibrations.  The results of this research are expected to have an impact   in atmospheric chemistry, combustion, and the understanding of plasmas",
