They plan to involve about 60-70 investigators (including graduate students) from the US, Mexico, and other nations on discussing specifics of the evolution of the rift system and comparison to other rift systems of the world.  This should allow them assess the state of knowledge of the Gulf of California, and to identify important problems for future work in the region, both onshore and in the Gulf of California.  There are three major scientific reasons why a Penrose conference on this topic is extremely timely.  (1) A re-evaluation of the post-25 Ma evolution of the San Andreas fault system has occurred in recent years.  This is directly relevant to development of the Gulf of California because the San Andreas fault system is the northern continuation of the Gulf of California because the San Andreas fault system is the northern continuation of the Gulf  of California transform-rift syst em.  (2) More detailed and better constrained models of the evolution of the Pacific-North America plate boundary have improved correlations between tectonic events in the Gulf region and changes in relative plate motion.  (3) A series of analytical and experimental models of the structural evolution of oblique-rift plate margins have been published in the past few years, but these generally lack thorough testing by field studies.  The margins of the Gulf of California are an ideal place to conduct such research.  Support is provided Earth Sciences (Tectonics) and Ocean Sciences (Marine Geology and Geophysics) for partial coverage of participant support costs.
