 "awd_abstract_narration": "(1) This multi-disciplinary project concentrates on  developing computation at the molecular level, via  manipulation of DNA strands on surfaces. An  experimental demonstration of DNA-based computation by  Adleman(a) has changed the view of what computation is,  (b) offers the potential for unprecedented computing  power at the molecular level, and (c) raises  fundamentally new research problems in chemistry,  computer science, and material science.  This project  represents a concerted attack on these problems which  involves close collaboration between chemists, material  scientists, and computer scientists.(2) This research  will help answer two major questions on DNAcomputation.  First, does computation at the molecular level have the  potential to provide computing power that is orders of  magnitude greater than foreseeable extrapolations of  current technology? Second, is this type of computation  suited to solving NP-hard problems (problems that are  well beyond the limits of current technology?(3) The  potential for huge computing power rests on the use of  DNA strands to encode information and the manipulation  of these strands in a massively parallel fashion,  involving as many as 2^70 (2 to the 70th power)  distinct strands.  The premise of this project is that  surface-based chemistry is a critical technology in  approaching this scale.  With this approach, DNA  strands are immobilized on a surface, thus allowing a  much greater degree of control in chemical processes  that manipulate the DNA than is achievable via the test  tube based methodology of Adleman. While surfacebased  chemistry is the basis for recent strides in  combinatorial chemistry, this project is the FIRST to  fully exploit surface-based manipulation of DNA strands  for the purposes of DNA computation.(4) Scaling up  current surface chemistry to approach the requirements  of DNA-based computation requires high-quality research  at the interface of materials science and chemistry.  Improvements in the nanoscale morph ology and chemical  makeup of the surface is key to ensuring that a high  density of information can be obtained and reliable  chemical manipulations performed.  Good surface  attachment chemistry and control of chemical  ``operations'' or enzymatic            processes are also extensively developed. This project  should result in significant advances in the state of-  the-art in surface chemistry and should provide a solid  basis for predicting the limits of surfacebased DNA  computation.(5) An eventual goal of DNA-based  computation is to perform massivelyparallel searches  for optimal solutions of NPhard problems.  However, the  differences between DNAbased computation and  conventional technology require that radically new  algorithms be developed for this paradigm. Tempering  the potential for unprecedented parallelism (up to 2^70  simultaneous operations) is extremely slow and  errorprone nature of the operations themselves. Novel  strategies for generating and searching solution spaces  for NPhard problems are investigated.   These  strategies embody sound algorithmic principles that can  be applied to a range of problems.  Using a combination  of analysis and simulations, the effectiveness of these  strategies are tested on selected applications. This  work provides new ways of attacking NPhard problems  that, while designed for a hypothetical DNA based  computer, are valuable for massively parallel computing  paradigms, other than the DNA-based paradigm studied  here.(6) Thus this comprehensive program will provide a  deep understanding of the potential and limitations of  DNAbased computation, from both the chemical and  algorithmic viewpoints.***",
