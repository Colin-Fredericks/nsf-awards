Yet, biological and behavioral evidence has  demonstrated visual modularity; different visual areas within the  mammalian brain respond to particular features such as color,  motion, shape, size, or location.  The way in which these  features get bound together in awareness to produce normal  coherence is not known.  One major cognitive theory has proposed  that attention to spatial locations provides the basis for  feature binding.  It follows that damage to areas of the brain  that represent spatial information should produce severe problems  in binding features together to produce perceptual wholes.    This research will explore the relationships between selective  attention, spatial representations, feature binding, and object  individuation, using evidence from the breakdown of performance  in individuals with damage to brain areas that disrupt spatial  perception.  The main hypothesis is that interactions between  neural areas that represent object features and those that  represent space achieve accurate visual percepts and produce  rapid and accurate visual search, especially when feature binding  is required.  Thus, the spatial problems observed in individuals  with selected types of neurological damage should be accompanied  by problems with specific types of object perception that require  integration.  Individuals with selected spatial deficits will be  tested in both object perception and spatial tasks to look for  hypothesized relationships between the two.  Other studies will  attempt to determine the type of spatial information that is  critical for feature binding and that which is not.  Behavioral  measures will include error data and reaction time.  Biological  measures will include lesion location and volume, as determined  by reconstructed 3-D structural MRI.    Although physiological and metabolic techniques for measuring  cortical function in neurologically normal individu als have  improved dramatically in the recent past, observing the effects  of lesions remains a major means to determine whether or not a  particular region of the brain is both sufficient and necessary  for a particular function.  Evidence derived from humans with  lesions to particular areas provides informative data to build  hypotheses about function and interactions between functions that  then might be observed using other techniques, such as single  unit recording in animals or functional imaging in normal  individuals.  The data may contribute at least a partial solution  to the binding problem and will certainly suggest where to look  for correlated neural activity that may support accurate feature  integration.    ***",
