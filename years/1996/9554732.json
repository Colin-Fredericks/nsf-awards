 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the two years of this proposed faculty development project  more than 400 undergraduate economics professors will:  participate  in hands-on activities focussing on methods for integrating the new  scholarship on the economics of women and minorities into  introductory economics courses; revise all aspects of their courses  to reflect the teaching and assessment of student learning of this  scholarship; and disseminate the results of these activities. These  faculty development activities are informed by, grow out of, and  adapt the very successful NSF funded programs we've held in the  summers of 1993, 1994, and 1995 (June 15 - 20, Wellesley College).   This proposed project will extend the results of prior NSF support  to ensure the long term impact of these innovations in  undergraduate economics education.  During the three years of  proposed activities Project Director Feiner will work with Project  co-PIs to plan, advertise and conduct one, 1.5 day and four, 2.5  day faculty development conferences focussing on integrating race  and gender into introductory economics (Two 2.5 day conferences are  scheduled in the first year, two 2.5 day conferences and one 1.5  day conference are scheduled in the second year.)  The 1.5 day  program will run immediately prior to regional Eastern Economics  Association meetings in March of 1997, the 2.5 day programs will  target various sub-sets of the profession including economics  faculty teaching at; women's colleges, historically black colleges,  colleges with substantial Hispanic/Native American enrollments,  community colleges serving underrepresented populations, and new  minted Ph.D.'s.  Each program (excluding the last) will accommodate  40 participants who will work in small groups to develop:  ways to  use the work of prior NSF conferences in their classrooms;  strategies for teaching economic controversies in a manner which  facilitates students' critical thinking capacities; the pedagogies  associated with diversity and the classroom clima te; and  instructional materials for the range of course activities which  incorporate race, gender and active learning.  Participants will  critique and refine these modifications and develop techniques to  assess the impact of these changes on student outcomes.  The last  program is the Capstone Conference and is planned for 250  participants.  It will be held at the University of Southern Maine  in October 1997.  Upon return to his/her home institution faculty  will teach their redesigned courses, and assess the project's  impact on student outcomes and faculty intellectual growth.   Dissemination occurs as participants:  share project results with  department colleagues; meet at the Allied Social Science  Association Meetings (the annual meeting of the AEA); present  papers at regularly scheduled professional meetings; and  participate in panels or workshops during the Capstone conference  scheduled for October, 1997 open to all interested members of the  economics profession.  Conference proceedings will be published in  an edited volume.  This project has the potential to significantly  affect the teaching of economics while greatly increasing the  numbers of minority and female undergraduates pursuing economics.",
