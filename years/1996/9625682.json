The MOANA WAVE is a 210' research vessel owned  by the U.S. Navy and operated as a UNOLS vessel in support of  academic research.  The ship is scheduled for 174 days of which 116  are in support of NSF-supported programs.  One NSF cruise is in the  south Pacific near Samoa, the remaining are of short duration out  of Hawaii in support the Hawaii Time Series project.  In addition  the vessel will support cruises for NOAA, Navy and the State of  Hawaii.         The MOANA WAVE is part of the academic fleet used by NSF to  support oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic research  requires highly specialized equipment that must be permanently  installed on a ship for which the ship must be specifically  designed.  This equipment also requires highly trained crew members  for maintenance and operation.  These vessels do not operate in the  same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore, NSF  supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically  dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by  universities and research institutions around the country.          ***",
