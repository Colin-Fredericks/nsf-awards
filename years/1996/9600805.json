 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hurley  9600805      The cells of the hypothalamic region of the brain produce small  protein hormones called peptide releasing- and release-inhibiting  factors which act on the pituitary gland to regulate the synthesis  and secretion of the peripherally active hormones derived from this  tissue.  While it is clear that the hypothalamic releasing- and  release-inhibiting peptides bind to receptors on pituitary cells,  and alter intracellular levels of second messengers such as cyclic  AMP or calcium, the downstream events that link the intracellular  messengers to alterations in gene expression are presently unclear.   Dr. Hurley is characterizing a newly discovered intranuclear  factor, Zn-15, that may prove to be one of the important links  between the second messenger systems and regulation of gene  transcription.  He is determining the mechanisms involved in the  physiological regulation of the expression of Zn-15 and the ability  of Zn-15 to control expression of pituitary hormone genes. These  investigations will result in novel information concerning the  regulation of the function of the neuroendocrine axis, and  organismal growth and development.  In this CAREER proposal, the  educational component includes the development of novel  computer-assisted learning program for basic biochemistry and  expansion of the use of this powerful tool into all levels of  higher education.  In addition, significant integration of research  skills with computer tutelage is to be used to foster undergraduate  interest in biochemical neuroendocrinology.  These endeavors will  provide the students with unique educational and research  opportunities intended to develop new generations of researchers  and educators.",
