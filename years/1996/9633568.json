 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Dimitri Coucouvanis, Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan,  is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of  the Chemistry Division to perform synthetic, structural and reactivity   studies on supramolecules obtained from catechol functionalized   macrocycles.  The systems of interest include catechol-functionalized   tetraazamacrocyclic  complexes capable of undergoing intramolecular   electron transfer upon changes in pH,  supramolecular crown ethers which   change their function depending on what is bound in the crown ether   portion of the molecule, and optically active `propeller` molecules which   could be useful as supports capable of asymmetric induction in the   epoxidation of olefins.  Molecular `reactors` which contain separate   subunits for both the storage of electrons and the activation of small   molecules will also be synthesized and their reactivity patterns   delineated. The chemistry of coordinated sulfur and selenium ligands in   niobium and tantalum complexes and their reactivity with heteroallenes,   alkenes, alkynes, sulfur dioxide and molecular hydrogen will also be   explored.  Molecular architecture involves the synthesis of complex,   multi-functional systems which are designed to transform a bound   substrate molecule, much the way enzymes function in living systems.    Metallomacrocycles, systems which incorporate metal ions into large ring   structures, are examples of these so  called `supramolecular` systems.   These molecules may function as elementary molecular devices with   potential applications in photochemically induced charge separation,   photoswitching, catalytic redox processes, electron storage, or substrate   molecule activation.",
