 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612509  Campbell    The Arabian Sea is an intensely dynamic region of the  world's  oceans driven by strong seasonal reversals in  monsoon winds.  The region is interesting in the context of  the Joint Global spatial  scales \"extremes\" in ocean  production systems -coastal upwelling  to open ocean  oligotrophic -- under relatively constant tropical  illumination.  It is thus a natural laboratory to test  conceptual  linkages among physical forcing, food-wed  structure, biogeochemical cycling and fluxes, and carbon  burial in the sediments.  The general goals of this project  are to asses the roles of microzooplankton as consumers of  bacterial and phytoplankton production and to contribute to  nderstanding the relationships  among plankton community  structure, new production, and biogeochemical fluxes and  their responses to physical forcing the  Arabian Sea.  The  project is to be conducted during the spring  (April)  intermonsoon and summer (August) SW monsoon seasons, when  the most dramatic differences should be evident.  Abundance,  biomass, and specific growth rates of bacteria and  phytoplankton  will be determined by flow cytometric,  microscopic, and pigment analyses to determine their  variations with season, depth and  location.  The dominant  microzooplankton grazers on pico- and  nanoplankton will be  identified and quantified, and the impact of  their grazing  will be measured with a suite of complementary  methods  including dilution, fluorescently-labelled prey, size-  fractionation, and specific metabolic inhibitors.  Results  of this  project will contribute to understanding how global  climate changes, which may affect prevailing forcing winds,  will alter phytoplankton community structure and in turn how  these changes in  structure of the food web affect carbon  storage and export from the  upper water column.  ***",
