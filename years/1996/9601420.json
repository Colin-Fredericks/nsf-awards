The objective is to  carry out comparative studies of the performance of two  boundary layer wind tunnels, one in Montevideo, under the  direction of IMFIA and the other at the St. Anthony Falls  Laboratory (SAFL), Minnesota.  The proposed program will  provide prototype performance data for several of the tunnel  components.  Simulations of atmospheric boundary layers in  both tunnels would be compared, with attention to the  effects of turbulence and its scales on the mean and  fluctuating pressures on building models.    Considerable advances have been made in ongoing research to  investigate critical issues in the modeling of atmospheric  boundary layers, but there are many aspects of the  techniques that still require investigation.  Results of  this research, which complements earlier NSF funded work  related to the design and evaluation of the SAFL tunnel,  would make a contribution toward a better understanding of  the flow dynamics and the identification of essential  modeling requirements.  The benefit to the U.S. research  effort will be in added manpower, and broadened scope of  work to include different component geometries and scales,  and the opportunity to advance the international exchange of  scientific knowledge.  ***",
