This three-week,  parallel track workshop will bring together 10-12 senior  mathematical behavioral scientists and 20 junior ones (advanced  graduate students and young postdoctoral scientists) to reflect  on and synthesize these developments, and to lay out the ground  work for future research.  The workshop will focus on six areas,  each involving two senior people and all of the junior ones.  The  modeling areas will include (1) perception and psychophysics,   (2) learning and memory, (3) information processing,            (4) measurement,  (5) judgment and decision making, and (6)  general modeling and testing issues.    The profession will benefit in two major ways.  First, because  much of the existing work is scattered throughout many journals  and books and because many of the younger scholars, who are  trained primarily in one area, are located in more-or-less  isolated settings without senior colleagues, it is difficult for  them to become fully aware of state-of-the-art mathematical  modeling approaches arising in other areas but potentially useful  in their research.  In a broad sense, then, the workshop is  designed to consolidate past research of the field and to nurture  the next generation of scientists.  Second, by doing this  systematically and providing ample time for interactions, it is  possible that new lines of research will be initiated.  Materials  prepared in advance, during, and after the workshop will be made   available to a much wider audience on the World Wide Web.   Depending upon the outcome of the several sections, edited  volumes may appear.    Though the goal of such work is deeper scientific understanding  of various aspects of human behavior, there is great potential  for direct benefit to society.  In the past, such developments  have, among other things, led to better ways t o measure student's  accomplishments (first, IQ testing which evolved into a large  industry and now, newer, more multi-faceted approaches that are  reaching schools), models to describe quite accurately decision  making in situations of uncertainty, which has led to the  profession of decision analysts, and vastly improved research on  visual and auditory systems, which has been used to improve the  performance of people in various human-machine interfaces.  New  modeling work can be expected to greatly improve these existing  applications, as well as to provide the possibility for  additional applications.    ***",
