 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometric drawings give rise to many interesting and important  problems which are the extensions, generalizations, or the dual  forms of the well known planar crossing problem.  A k-crossing in  a geometric drawing is defined to be a set of k edges which  pairwise cross in the drawing.  An interesting problem here is to  generate geometric drawings with small number of k-crossings, for  a given graph and a given k>1.  Another important problem is the  crossing clique problem, in which the objective is to generate  geometric drawings so that the largest clique of crossings (the  largest k so that the drawing has a k-crossing) is small.  This  problem is closely related to the page number problem and has  nice applications to the theory of VLSI.  The dual concept to a k-  crossing is a k-disjoint set: Given a geometric drawing of the G,  a k-disjoint set is a set of k edges which are pairwise non-  crossing in the drawing.  The concept of k-disjoint sets gives  rise to problems which are similar to those of k-crossings, in a  dual setting.  It is the goal of this investigation to study k-  crossings, k-disjoint sets, and the crossing clique problem.  The  aim is to develop algorithms which can generate solutions whose  quality can be guaranteed and/or to develop general structural  results in a form which could be applicable to a broad class of  graphs.  ***",
