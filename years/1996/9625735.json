 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amherst  This starter grant award to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst   will support the research of Professor Scott M. Auerbach.  The theme of   the research is catalysis and transport in molecular sieves.  The present   studies focus on aluminosilicates that are microporous (zeolites), as   well as those that are mesoporous (for example, MCM-41). Study of the   chemical dynamics of zeolite acid proton transport and hydrocarbon   reactivity is advanced by new methods in classical and quantum reaction   rate theory.  Chemically selective catalysis and transport is modelled by   adjusting the electrostatic and steric properties of the framework,   compensating ions, and sorbates.  Also examined is how derivatizing   MCM-41 can have different effects on polar and nonpolar diffusants.  The   research models selectivity in trapping and storing fluorocarbons in   zeolites, addressing how halogen substituent effects control diffusion in   micropores.  This research will advance understanding of the properties of microporous   and mesoporous materials useful for solving important technological   problems.  Zeolites are used for separating chemical mixtures, as   environmentally safe detergents, and as catalysts in petroleum cracking.    Mesoporous sieves show promise for separating biomolecules and may be   useful for making optical electronic materials with substantial quantum   confinement.",
