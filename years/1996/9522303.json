 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry Program, will support the research of Professor Omar Yaghi of   Arizona State University on the synthesis of new porous solids from   soluble molecular building blocks.  The focus of the project is the   development and understanding of two fundamental issues that are relevant   to the preparation of solids from molecular building blocks: 1) how to   control the relative orientation of the molecular components so that the   resulting structure has the desired structure, stability and physical   properties, and 2) how to obtain the solid product in crystalline form so   that its structure is readily determined.   The general method to be used   will involve the room-temperature condensation polymerization of   inorganic clusters or suitably functionalized coordination compounds   using  polymeric matrices as diffusion and reaction media for addition   copolymerization and condensation polymerization reactions.  The   anticipated zeolitic type structures are expected to have voids that can   accommodate guest molecules or ions and thus to be useful in separations,   ion-exchange, and catalysis.  In principle, these framework structures   can be chemically modified and manipulated to predictably vary their   properties.   The term porous solid applies to a class of network solids that contain   channels and voids that are comparable in size to many small molecules   and ions.  Such species often may diffuse into these solids to be   exchanged for an existing ion or to be otherwise retained as a result of   intermolecular interactions.  Such solids are widely used industrially   for the selective adsorption and catalytic transformation of molecular   structures, particularly through acid catalyzed pathways.  Such materials   are usually synthesized by high temperature processes that often do not   provide crystalline products.  This research project will attempt the   synthesis of porous solids by formation of bonds between small pre-formed   fragments of the desired structure through various types of    room-temperature, condensation polymerization reactions.  Polymeric   matrices will be used as reaction media to prevent the formation of more   dense  structures and to slow the condensation process such that crystals   are more likely to be formed.  The materials that result from this   project may be useful in separations technology and in catalysis.",
