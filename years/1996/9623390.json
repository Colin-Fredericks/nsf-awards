 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9623390   Li      The PI will develop further the method of moving planes and study   the following three problems: the  a priori estimates, classification, and   asymptotic analysis of solutions to some nonlinear differential equations;   the prescribed Gaussian (or scalar) curvature problem; and the existence,   uniqueness, and stability of travelling fronts. One focusing point of this   project is to classify singular solutions or sequences of blow-up solutions   in terms of when, where, how, and in what form do they occur. The method of   moving planes is the main tool to be developed and used for this and other   purposes. The analysis is particularly useful in the study of the last two   problems where the PI has already obtained some interesting results.    Many aspects of natural phenomena are related to each other by the natural   laws governing them and very often these laws are described by differential   equations. To understand these differential equations, it is necessary to   classify all possible singular solutions or sequences of blow-up solutions.   The PI proposes to study the prescribing curvature problem which involves   some very challenging nonlinear partial differential equations. In fact, this   type of equations also appear in many different fields of sciences. Also,   singular solutions or sequences of blow-up solutions are the major barriers   to the complete understanding of these equations. The PI will also study the   existence, uniqueness, and stability of travelling fronts which describe the   long term behavior of solutions to evolution type equations. He is mainly   interested in problems arising from population dynamics and from flame   propagation and ignition in combustion theory.",
