 "awd_abstract_narration": "BEST (Basic Engineering Software for Teaching) Dynamics, the  work of faculty and students of the Basic Engineering  department of the University of Missouri--Rolla, began in  1992. The work has been favorably received by our students  and by engineering educators. Because of the project's  success, UM-Rolla has continued to support the work, and  recently, the BEST project was awarded funding by the  University of Missouri's Institute for Instructional  Development (IID). The project's goals are fourfold: (1) To  promote visualization of dynamics problems; (2) To promote  students' problem-solving skills; (3) To cultivate in  students 'expert knowledge,' that is, an appreciation for  and a reliance upon the foundational, unifying concepts of  engineering dynamics, and to be able to apply these with  confidence to virtually any problem; (4) To create a  revolutionary teaching/learning product that, instead of  being a classroom supplement, will be a catalyst for change,  shifting classes from a teachercentered lecture format to a  student- and team-centered discovery format. The most  distinctive feature of the proposed work is its scope. Not  just an add-on to an existing class reinforcing only a topic  or two, this project will produce a CD containing  essentially an entire engineering dynamics course. It will  contain essential theory, including short video segments on  key topics; sixty interesting, creative problems with  variable input parameters; step-by-step problem solution  procedures with the exact equations and numbers from  specific student-created cases; guided tours of interesting  cases; and assessment quizzes on both theory and problem-  solving, all with an easy to use, intuitive interface.  Because dynamics is a difficult-to-learn class taken by  nearly all engineering students, the impact of this project  is expected to be widespread.",
