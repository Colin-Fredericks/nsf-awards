The project will enhance an initial 40 cadre teachers to prepare a cohort of 400 second tier teachers in ten schools in six states.  Teachers participating in the enhancement will be divided into ten teacher/leader teams.  These teams will provide guidance to the project's leadership in the development of design and technology enhancement support materials including an Implementation Resource Guide and videos.  These materials will be specifically designed to combine contemporary pedagogy with the delivery of technical content in the science, mathematics, and technology areas.  The teacher/leader teams will also assist with the delivery of two graduate level courses, provide leadership at 10 demonstration sites, assist with community outreach seminars, and participate in a one week, terminal year, National Dissemination workshop.  This project will extend and implement the curriculum materials developed through a NSF funded instructional materials development project (Project UPDATE - Upgrading Practice through Design and Technology/Engineering Education).",
