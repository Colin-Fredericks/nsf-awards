 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award is to support collaborative research by Dr. Ben Chu, Chemistry Department, State University of New York at Stony Brook and Dr. Burak Erman, Polymer Research Center, Bogazici University in Istanbul, Turkey.  In this research the two scientists will use a combination of modern analytical methods (e.g synchrotron ultrasmall angle x-ray scattering) and modern computer simulation techniques (e.g. molecular dynamics) to provide deeper understanding of the structure/property relationship for the self-assembly behavior of block copolymers in supercritical fluids.  It is proposed to use short-chain diblocks of F3C(CF2)m-(CH2)nCH3 in supercritical Carbon dioxide and to investigate the self-assembly behavior as a function of polymer concentration, total chain length, chain length ratio, temperature and CO2 pressure by means of computer simulations, experiment and modeling.  Scope: This award is to partially fund visits by the U.S. P.I. and a U.S. graduate student to Bogazici University, and the visit of the Turkish scientist to SUNY,Stony Brook.  Dr. Erman will be seeking funds from the Turkish Government to cover part of the costs in that country.  The project brings two very experienced scientists in the field of polymer chemistry to collaborate on understanding the process of polymerization.  The expected results could help improve the production of polymers without the use of organic sulfurs which are an environmental hazard.  The project also allows for the training of a U.S. graduate student in an international setting at one of Turkey's best technical universities.  The project fits well with the objectives of the Division of International Programs.",
