Hunt, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, at the Japan  Marine Science and Technology Center (JAMSTEC), Yokosuka,  Japan.  Dr. Hunt will work with Dr. Jun Hashimoto at JAMSTEC  in a project entitled, \"The Behavioral Ecology of the Mid-  Water Community of the Kuroshio Current.\"    The proposed research will examine the role of squids within  the mid-water community through the use of deep-sea  submersibles.  These squids are important commercially and  biologically.  By combining in situ observations with  laboratory experiments, he will consider several specific  hypotheses relating distribution patterns and feeding  behaviors to information acquired from sonar equipment.  The  result will provide an understanding of the mid-water food  web, how this web might change as environmental conditions  change, and how to accurately assess and manage marine  resources.    The proposed research addresses topics that are both current  and important in the field of biological oceanography and  JAMSTEC will provide the applicant with some of the most  advanced crewed and robotic submersible systems available in  the world.  The applicant will pioneer significant  exploratory use of the diving equipment for midwater  biological research.   Both applicant and host scientist  have discussed the project in detail, they have provided  plausible and testable hypotheses, and it is likely the  research will yield positive and mutually beneficial results  for both the United States and Japan.  ***",
