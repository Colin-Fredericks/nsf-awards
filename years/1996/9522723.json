 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Mukul Kundu of the Department  of Astronomy , University of Maryland at College Park and Dr. Takashi Sakurai of the National Astronomical Observatory, Mitaka, Japan.  Project funding will permit Dr. Kundu to spend 6 months in Japan, resident in Mitaka, in order to study the sun's corona using simultaneously obtained X-ray and radio observations with the Japanese Space mission Yohkoh and ground based radio telescopes.  Dr. Kundu has made pioneering contributions to the knowledge of the sun's corona using combined radio and X-ray imaging data.  Dr. Sakurai will bring his theoretical expertise to the problem of studying solar active regions and flares from the point of view of magnetic energy storage and trigger mechanisms.  They will jointly study a broad range of solar coronal phenomena : study of  X-ray emission above sunspots, study of radio emission associated with coronal jets, study of the evolution of active regions in terms of flare productivity.  This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries working in the area of solar coronal physics.  The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques related to Yohkoh X-ray techniques while contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international collaboration.",
