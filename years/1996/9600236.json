The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit which will support Dr. Matthew A. Roberts to work with  Dr. Hubert Girault at the Ecole Polytechnique Federal de  Lausanne in Switzerland.        The objective of this project is to 1) produce a  microfabricated liquid handling device with an  interdigitated array (IDA) electrochemical (EC) detection  cell and 2) to utilize IDAs for EC detection of immunoassays  within the proposed microfabricated liquid handling device.  The production of this miniaturized chemical analysis system  device will be able to monitor environmental pollutants in a  truly field-portable fashion. Analysis times of less than  five minutes are expected which could be used for the rapid  analysis of priority pollutants and quick mapping of  contaminant mobility at remediation sites.  This technology  will help reduce characterization and overall remediation  costs at sites associated with national Superfund programs  due to these advantages.  ***",
