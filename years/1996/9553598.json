 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553598  Katims    The PACKETS Program is a system of classroom-based performance activities to be planned, designed, implemented, and delivered by the Educational Testing Service over a two year period.  These authentic assessment activities will promote learning and document that learning concurrently.  The two major goals of PACKETS are   to develop a model PACKETS program for students in grades 3-5 and to arrange for dissemination of the materials to reach as many classrooms as possible.    The development process is designed to ensure that the materials work well in a variety of classrooms,  with students and teachers from diverse backgrounds.  The process will include cycles of piloting, field-testing, and revising, relying heavily on input from teachers, students, and other practitioners.   Major national educational improvement efforts, including the Systemic Initiatives and the National Standards movement, place a high priority on integrating assessment strategies with instruction. As a result of this project, upper elementary teachers will have exemplary models of how to integrate assessment with instruction, engaging their students in meaningful, complex, and mathematically rich problems as a part of their regular instructional programs.",
