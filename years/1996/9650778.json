 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering training in biotechnology requires an understanding of the biological process involved and the constraints and requirements of large-scale manufacturing. Although many colleges and universities have developed successful postbaccalaureate training programs in biotechnology and biochemical engineering, similar programs are not available at the introductory undergraduate level. By introducing students to the engineering aspects of biotechnology at a very early stage (freshmen or sophomore level) the project motivates them into acquiring the necessary biology, chemistry, and engineering knowledge required for a successful career in biotechnology.   A Biotechnology Engineering Laboratory is being established with the goal of developing a group of experiments that can be used to exemplify the contribution of engineering to biotechnology. Each experimental unit can be used as modules for an introductory (freshmen or sophomore) level biotechnology engineering course, or the combined group of experiments can be used to teach an upper undergraduate or graduate level laboratory course in biotechnology engineering. The Biotechnology Laboratory is being used for a variety of purposes:  teaching both at the introductory (freshmen and sophomore) and advanced (senior and graduate) levels, and research for both undergraduates interested in conducting an independent study or a senior research project, and high school students, in particular women and minority students, as part of summer internships. The project is developing a group of experiments that can be used at all levels, from introductory to advanced level courses; to integrate engineering in the interdisciplinary teaching of biotechnology that already includes biology and chemistry; and to attract students interested in satisfying math/science requirements to experience a state-of-the-art engineering laboratory with the ultimate purpose of permanently attracting them to a science and engineering education.",
