 "awd_abstract_narration": "9645767  Verghese       Dynamic studies in power systems have long exploited  analytic simplifications gained by approximating all voltages and  currents in the network as sinusoids of \"slowly varying\"  magnitude and phase.  With this assumption, network behavior in  dynamic analyses is characterized by power flow equations that  represent time-domain bus voltages via complex phasors.  This is  typically referred to as the \"sinusoidal quasi-steady-state\"  approximation (abbreviated here by the acronym \"SQSS\"), and is  widely utilized in modern computer packages used to study  electromechanical behavior and control system dynamics.  For  faster time-scale phenomena, the most widely used techniques are  time-domain simulations in which all relevant network voltages  and currents are represented as three-phase, time-domain signals,  without any requirement of nearly sinusoidal behavior.  This  latter approach involves tremendous computational burden and  analytic complexity, because one uses instantaneous quantities  rather than phasor, and dynamic circuit models rather than  algebraic impedance relations.       The goal of the research outlined in this proposal is to   provide a middle ground between the approximations inherent in an  impedance-based SQSS representation, and the analytic complexity  and computational burden associated with representing network  voltages and currents as time-domain quantities in a three-phase  circuit.  In particular, this work will adopt a viewpoint on  phasors that is closer to time/frequency representations utilized  in signal processing, but extending these representations to a  dynamic formulation.  The result will be termed \"Phasor Dynamics\"  (PD) models, and will involve a carefully constructed hybrid of  the impedance and circuit representations.  This approach will  allow an important extension that is not possible in standard  phasor representations: a dynamic analysis that includes higher  order harmonics.  The work proposed will treat these cases by  re presenting relevant states as weighted sums of narrow-band  signals, each located about a harmonic center frequency of  interest.  The time evolution of the weights are governed by  dynamic equations derived directly from the original  instantaneous model.  ***",
