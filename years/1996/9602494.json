 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to make more precise and more  general tests of the Universality of Gravitational Free  Fall.  The standard, classical theory of gravity, General  Relativity, incorporates the Universality of Free Fall as an  exact statement about gravity.  It is an experimental  question, however, if this principle holds exactly.  There  are two strong reasons for testing the principle.  First,  General Relativity is not a quantum mechanical theory and  some current ideas about possible quantum-mechanical  theories of gravity predict violations of the Universality  of Free Fall arising from additional `gravitational` scalar  or vector fields.  Second, by searching for violations of a  symmetry that classical gravity holds to be exact, one can  probe for new, ultra-weak, non-gravitational forces.  Because it is impossible to shield a gravitational field,  such ultra-weak forces would normally lie hidden `underneath  gravity`.  But any new force is expected to violate the  Universality of Free Fall and so can be detected even if it  is much weaker than gravity.  The proposed tests require the continued development of  improved instruments for measuring tiny differences in the  accelerations of different materials attracted toward the  earth, toward a massive Uranium laboratory source, or to  astronomical structures.  Three different torsion-balance  instruments will be employed.  Two of them, developed under  previous NSF support, will be upgraded for the proposed  tests, and a new more sensitive instrument will be  constructed.  The combination of these instruments will  permit tests of the Universality of Free Fall over length  scales ranging from 1 cm to infinity.  In particular, it  will be possible to test whether gravity is the dominant  long-range force between ordinary mater and the cosmological  dark matter; and, in conjunction with existing data on lunar  laser-ranging, to make a `loop-hole free` test of the  gravitational properties of gravitational binding energy.  This last test will be performed by comparing the  accelerations toward the sun of `scale models` of the Moon  and the Earth's crust.",
