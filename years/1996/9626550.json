 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626550  Gordon       Cameron Gordon will continue to investigate Dehn surgery on knots.  The  main goal is further to circumscribe the various exceptional (non-hyperbolic)  surgeries on hyperbolic knots.  The known bounds on the number and nature of  such surgeries are now quite sharp in many cases, and it seems that it may  eventually be possible (at least modulo the Geometrization Conjecture of  Thurston) to give an essentially complete description of all exceptional  surgeries.  The methods used will be based largely on the combinatorial-  topological techniques developed by Gordon and John Luecke in their previous   work on Dehn surgery, such as the proof of the Knot Complement Conjecture.       This project deals with knot theory and 3-dimensional topology, the  general goal of the latter being to understand the structure of 3-dimensional  manifolds.  These are objects that are locally like ordinary 3-dimensional  Euclidean space but whose global structure may be quite complicated.  Since  we live in a 3-manifold, one might say that 3-dimensional topology aims to   describe what the mathematical possibilities are for our spatial universe.    This aim is still not realized, although there is tantalizing evidence that  such a description might ultimately be possible.  One important aspect of  3-dimensional topology is the theory of knots---a knot being a closed loop  embedded somehow in ordinary 3-dimensional space.  On the one hand, results  about 3-manifolds often give information about knots as special cases, while  on the other hand, a wide variety of mathematical methods can be applied to  the study of knots, leading in turn to new information about 3-manifolds.    (Recently, deep connections between 3-dimensional topology and quantum field  theory were discovered in this way.)  The main vehicle by which knot theory  relates to the general theory of 3-manifolds is Dehn surgery, and this is the  focus of the current project.  In Dehn surgery, a solid tube around a knot is  removed and \"s ewn back\" differently, giving a new 3-manifold.  If one allows  links (i.e., several loops linked together) as well as knots, then every  3-manifold can be obtained in this way, so a sufficiently good understanding   of this construction would have important implications for the general theory   of 3-manifolds.  ***",
