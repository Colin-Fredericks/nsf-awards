 "awd_abstract_narration": "SRS 96-15976  Link  The purpose of this  innovative study is to explore the  feasibility of developing a database of quantitative  information on the licensing patterns of U. S. firms.  It is  expected that this database will provide the first  systematic information across firms and industries on the  propensity to acquire technical knowledge through licensing  arrangements rather than through their R&D or through other  external sources.  Moreover, licensing activity appears,  based on the limited stylized information available, to be  an important element of the portfolio of sources of  technical knowledge that firms draw upon as a part of their  overall innovative strategy.    The proposed study ventures into an important research area,  namely understanding and documenting across industries an  element of a firm's portfolio of technical information  previously unexplored.  While the broad topic of sources of  technical information is established in the innovation  related literature, a new, albeit exploratory, approach for  documenting patterns of licensing activity is being offered.  The proposed procedure uses legal decisions to identify  licensing activities and then matches the parties to those  licensing arrangements to patent citations.  The evidence on  licensing and patent citations is then used to predict  licensing patterns across industries.  The general use of  citation counts to explore technology flows is in its  infancy.   This study attempts to combine in a novel way  citation counts for patents with evidence about licensing  obtained from legal decisions.  If this approach is  successful,  the investigators will have begun to fill the  conspicuous void in information about the licensing of  technology.  ***",
