An integrated theoretical and  computational investigation will be made of the structural  properties of fragile glass-forming liquids and the relation  of this structure to the mechanisms of relaxation.    Glasses have become an increasingly important class of  materials in several new technologies.  They possess  advantages such as light weight and ease of processing, but  suffer from degradation through creep, fatigue, and  embrittlement.  To understand these mechanisms, it is  necessary to understand the structure of glasses and how  they relax.  At present, experiments can provide information  about relaxation processes in glasses, but do not yield much  information about their structure or relation of this  structure to the relaxation mechanisms.  In contrast,  computer simulations can provide information about  structure, but only on relatively short time and length  scales.  Moreover, theoretical understanding of glasses is  in a relatively crude state.    In this research, a sequence of models will be studied  beginning with a mean-field model of a glass-forming liquid  and proceeding via various approximation methods to include  non-mean-field effects.  Several parallel computer  architectures will be used to extend the  size and the time  scale of the systems simulated.  The simulations will be  based on an efficient message passing molecular dynamics  program, and by more speculative methods based on Fourier  acceleration algorithms and on cellular automata models.    The results of the theoretical investigations and computer  simulations, in conjunction with ongoing laboratory  experiments at Boston University and other locations, will  facilitate an understanding of the relation between the  relaxation observed  experimentally in deeply supercooled  liqui ds and glasses and the existence of structures seen in  computer simulations.  Understanding of this relation will  make it possible to use the structure of glasses to predict  their temporal evolution.    The research will be done in collaboration with colleagues  at Boston University in the Departments of Physics and  Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering, and the Center  for Computational Science.  In addition, colleagues in the  Physics Departments at Clark and Brandeis Universities, the  Center for Computational Materials at NIST, and at Thinking  Machines Corporation will participate.  Graduate students  will also participate through the NSF-sponsored Graduate  Research Training Program at the Center for Computational  Science at Boston University.  Computer platforms include  Boston University's 38-processor SGI Power Challenge array,  a work station cluster and several CAM-8 machines.
