 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an active research effort in microelectronic systems  architecture that enhances the undergraduate curriculum in Computer Engineering,  Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, and introduces students to new  computer architectures, new technology and microelectronic systems.  The ideas  developed will be incorporated into the microprocessor and computer architecture  curriculum along with new cooperative learning techniques.  The focus of the  research component is to devise and test Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP)  techniques and mechanisms.  Programmable Logic Devises, such as FPGAs, are used  to implement rapid system prototyping of custom computer designs and are also  used to implement custom components in reconfigurable architectures.  Engineers  and computer Science students are taught with highly participatory \"active  learning\" methods such as cooperative learning which stimulate student interest  and learning.  By introducing students to teamwork in the engineering classroom,  learning is enhanced, fruitful networking relationships are developed and  students are able to adapt easily into other team environments.  The rapid-  prototyping platform developed for this effort is used for several upper division  computer architecture and microprocessor courses and the cooperative learning  pedagogy serves a national model.",
