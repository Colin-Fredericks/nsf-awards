 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves acquisition of a near infrared (NIR) spectrometer, filling \"the spectral gap\" between UV-visible and mid-infrared spectroscopy in the department. This instrument represents an opportunity to explore and apply one of the spectroscopic methods most neglected in academic course offerings.   Interest in the applications of NIR spectroscopy has increased dramatically in the last decade, particularly in chemical industrial settings. However, this department is not able to adequately convey the current relevance of this methodology in industrial, agricultural, and biological applications because of the lack of proper instrumentation. To better prepare undergraduate students, not only those majoring in chemistry but also those pursuing degrees in engineering and biology-related fields, the project is introducing, at the sophomore and senior level, several experiments designed to emphasize the wide range of applicability of NIR spectroscopy. The project's experiments couple remote sensing with NIR spectroscopy to study processes relevant to industry and biology. Furthermore, to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of complex NIR spectra, students are taught the cautious use of signal processing algorithms. Graduates who are exposed to NIR spectroscopy will be better qualified and more able to tackle relevant questions with the best available technologies.   The impact of this addition to the program's instrumentation not only benefits undergraduate students, but also attends to one of the most neglected, yet most powerful, spectroscopic methodologies.",
