 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:   This project supports a cooperative project by a U.S. scientist, Dr. Howard Pickering, Department of Metals Science and Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University, University Park, and Dr. B.G. Ateya, Department of Chemistry, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.  The two propose to study the problem of de-alloying in corrosive environments, to understand the prevailing mechanisms and to identify and characterize the various rate processes involved.  The work involves physical and mathematical modeling and experimental measurements.  Scope:  This project meets the objectives of the Division of International Programs:  it allows cooperation of two eminent scientists whose capabilities complement each other to do important scientific work; it allows for a foreign scientist in a developing country to validate his analytical work using experimental techniques and facilities not available in his country; and it helps understand the causes of one of the most common, and most  serious, problems that affect industry, and consumers of various commercial products that are made of alloys.  The P.I. is one of this country's most renowned scientists in the field of corrosion.  The Egyptian team has an excellent capability and exceptional record of publications in the field.",
