 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553583  Kolodner    Project-based learning modules, built around engineering and design problems, promote the learning of essential concepts and processes in mathematics, science and technology education at the middle school addressed by the national standards. The methodology of problem-based learning is informed by research in cognitive science and education, and the experiences of teachers and science practitioners.  The modules, based on complex, realistic design problems, integrate the disciplinary material, focus on collaborative learning and doing, and foster reflection. There are several options available to arrive at a solution and both science knowledge and real world experience must be brought to bear in evaluating solutions.  Students design solutions, not just analyze existing solutions; they are asked to identify knowledge and information needed to solve the problem; students receive explicit feedback both about their reasoning process and about the solution. Computer support provides an interactive problem-solving environment, information resources and scaffolding for teachers. Diversity issues are addressed through the relevant realistic problems that are solved through cooperation and communication. The products of this pilot study include two engineering design problems for the sixth or seventh grade integrating life science, mathematics and technology, teacher materials that support problem-based learning, a software-based interactive problem-solving and learning environment and student assessments.",
