The method uses inelastic  electron  tunneling  spectroscopy (E3TS) adapted to  a  new  geometry,  the  \"self-assembling\" tunnel junction (SATJ). In a  SATJ,  the  oxide  layer of the metal-insulator-metal tunnel junctions normally used  in  IETS  is  replaced by an atornically-thin rare-gas  film.  By  replacing the oxide layer with a more inert one, any chemical  or  structural  changes  in the adsorbed molecules  illduced  by  the  oxide  may be avoided. Moreover, this technique m~kes it possible  to  dilectly  study the adsorption and reaction of  molecules  on  bare metal surfaces. 'rhe systernatics of SATJ's will he explored  to  deter~I~ine the SATJ's ultimate sensitivity and applicability  to  surface science. The vibrational spectra of C2H2, CO and  NH3  on platinum and tungsten surfaces will be studied to evaluate the  sensitivity  and  resolution of these junctions.  This  technique  will be applied to studies of surface reactions on metals and its  applicability to studies of surface chernistry on planar surfaces  of semiconductors will be investigated.    %%%    The  study  of  molecules and their interactions on  surfaces  is  important  for the continued success of numerous fields  such  as  catalysis,  corrosion  and  semiconductor  processing.   Although  scanning probe microscopes (SPM's) can provide real-space irnages  of  molecules at surfaces with atomic resolution, very o*en these  images  must  be supplemented by other measurements in  order  to  identify  the molecules. Vibrational spectroscopy is particularly  well  suited for chemical identification since the characteristic  molecular  vibrational  modes are  a  unique  fimgerpnnt  of  the  molecule.  In inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy  (II~TS),  the  vibrational  modes are detected by their  influence  on  the  tunneling  curr ent  between two metal surfaces  separated  by  an  oxide  layer. The goal of this project is to adapt IETS to a  new  experimental geometry in which the oxide layer is replaced by  an  inert  rare-gas  film.  13y  eliminating  the  oxide  layer,  the  chemical  changes  or structural modifications  of  the  adsorbed  molecules  induced by the presence of the oxide can  be  avoided.  The  systematics of this tcchnique will be examined to  determine  its ultimate sensitivity and applicability to surface science.  ***",
