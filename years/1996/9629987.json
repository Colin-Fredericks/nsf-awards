The field of strongly  correlated electrons has attracted a great deal of attention  from the physics and materials community since the discovery  in 1986 of  superconductivity at elevated temperatures.  Prior to this time, related phenomena were studied in  transition metal, rare earth and actinide compounds as well  as in magnetic alloys.  In contrast to the traditional  electronic band structure approach to solids, these  materials require one to include interelectronic  correlations in a fundamental manner.  In essence, these  systems involve the interplay of many coupled phase  transitions: metal-insulator, paramagnetic-  antiferromagnetic, normal-superconductor and various lattice  distortions.  This research involves an ongoing program  addressing how a microscopic theory of such materials can be  constructed which directly relates to experiment.    In particular, what is the nature of the ground state and  excitations, both spin and charge, in strongly correlated  materials?  In terms of these excitations, or more generally  spectral distributions, what is the effective pairing  potential which leads to superconductivity?  Why is the  pairing order parameter so anisotropic in these materials  compared to low temperature superconductors?  There has been  much debate whether spin and charge degrees of freedom are  separate excitations in two-dimensional systems, as they are  in one-dimension.  These and related questions will be  studied using a variety of methods including the coherent  state spin functional integral approach, quantum Monte Carlo  and exact diagonalization of clusters.  With close contact  to experiment we hope to make significant progress in  understanding these novel and technologically important  materials.  In addition, we will study the dynamics of  electrons moving in space-and time-dependent magnetic  fields, both to enlarge the range of experiments on  material s curretly carried out in uniform static magnetic  fields and to develop methods to treat time-dependent  magnetic alloy problems encountered in the coherent state  spin functional integral method and its counterparts.  %%%  Theoretical research will be conducted on a variety of  materials problems involving electrons which strongly  interact.  These types of problems are relevant to many  materials of current technological interest such as the high  temperature superconductors.  Unfortunately, conventional  concepts and theoretical methods are not directly  applicable.  Thus, new concepts and methods need to be  developed to understand these materials.  The present grant  will focus on the development of new techniques and the  application of new concepts to this important class of  problems.  ***",
