The overall  project objectives include: i) preparation of single crystal films and  device microstructures of organic second and third order optical materials,  ii) detailed studies of the off-resonant nonlinearities of the films and,  iii) demonstration of devices including phase-matched SHG in waveguides,  all-optical and electro-optic switching and logic. The nonlinear  optical  studies will include polarization dependent SHG and electro-optic effects  in second order optical films and time and wavelength resolved nonlinear  refractive index measurements for the  third order optical films. The  mechanisms involved in the off-resonant third order processes will  be  elucidated and picosecond all-optical logic will be demonstrated using  specific organic  materials and device geometries. Utilizing organic films  of very large second order nonlinearities,  electro-optic switching and  logic will be demonstrated. Specific conjugated polymers such as  polydiacetylenes are known to have extremely large nonlinear refractive  indices along with low  absorption coefficients in the off-resonant domain.  Such large nonlinearities are obtained only if the polymer chains are  organized as a single crystal. Specific organic molecular crystals (e.g.  NPP, DAST have very large and stable second order nonlinearities which can  be utilized in  many applications (e.g. SHG for infrared diode lasers,  electrooptic switching), if single crystal  films and waveguides can be  prepared. A method (\"shear method\" and its modified version) that  the  principal investigator has established, will be utilized for the  preparation of single crystal  films of the organic second and third order  optical materials. Subsequently specific device  microstructures in the  Fabry-Perot etalon and waveguide geom etries will be fabricated using the  films. The nonlinear optical measurements in the films and waveguides will  be performed using  established procedures. Recently, we have demonstrated  all-optical switching using the off-  resonant nonlinearity of a  polydiacetylene film, placed in a Fabry-Perot cavity. The measured  switching time was limited by the pulse-width (30ps) that was used.  Detailed measurements  involving all-optical logic and bistability will be  performed in this proposed work using !  picosecond and sub-picosecond  pulses. Ultrafast all-optical switching and logic in a compact device  geometry should have a variety of future applications in photonics. Single  crystal films  and waveguides of organic materials having very large second  order nonlinearities are expected  to have near-term applications in  frequency conversion and electro-optics. The research as  proposed is  important for fundamental understanding of these off-resonant nonlinear  optical  effects and for realizing many practical applications.  ***",
