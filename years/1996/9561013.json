 "awd_abstract_narration": "9561013  Fernandez     One of the most pervasive and important current technological trends is the use of light (photonics) to perform functions that previously were accomplished with electronics, or which simply were not feasible with older technologies; it is an important area within which to provide laboratory experiences.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop a novel instrument to measure fluorescence lifetimes and associated courseware targeted to undergraduate university level laboratory teaching and learning in the physical, chemical, biological and engineering sciences.  The instrument is based on an inexpensive, rugged phase fluorometer recently developed at Ciencia.  In the Phase I, courseware modules will be developed for specific experiments suitable for the laboratory component of general undergraduate physics courses (for science students), as well as for sophomore level optics courses and senior level student research.  Ciencia will collaborate with the University of Connecticut Physics Department in the development of the teaching modules and for testing the system in the classroom.   This instrument will make it possible to bring, for the first time, to undergraduate laboratories a capability that until now has only been available at highly specialized research centers.  Potential applications span physics, chemistry, biology and engineering laboratory courses.  Potential commercial applications include undergraduate laboratory research as well as classroom teaching in the laboratory component of undergraduate science and engineering courses.  Potential markets include the physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering departments at colleges and universities.",
