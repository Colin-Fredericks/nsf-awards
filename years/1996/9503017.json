 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dawes  9503017     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in a new method for detecting and classifying acoustic emissions (AE) resulting from crack growth in complex metal structures. To perform this research, a prototype acoustic emission sensor-processor system will be used to collect AE data in situ from the wing skin of a flight training aircraft in the vicinity of a landing gear assembly where fatigue cracking of the skin is a known problem. The proposed innovation, whose feasibility for this application was demonstrated in the Phase I project, is based on the use of the Parametric Avalanche Stochastic Filter (PASF), and on the similarity of the acoustic emission classification problem to certain problems of continuous speech recognition. In particular, the PASF is able to directly distinguish between crack events and other classes of acoustic signatures imbedded in a continuous, noisy data stream. It is anticipated that the results of this Phase II research will advance the use of AE technology to perform non-destructive evaluation (NDE) in a variety of applications, at a considerable cost savings over current methods.   Phase II research will demonstpate a successful AE-based NDE technology which can be marketed to the commercial and military aircraft manufacturing industry, commercial airlines, and aerospace maintenance and refurbishment firms. Technology developed in Phase II will also be used to pursue other NDE applications, including monitoring of pipelines, pressure vessels for the petrochemical and nuclear power industries, and testing of load-bearing structures.  p:\\sbir\\yhashimi\\9503017c.doc",
