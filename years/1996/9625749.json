 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625749  Nunes      This award provides support for the development of an  ultrafast scanning tunneling microscope capable of  investigating a wide variety of surface phenomena.  In order  to ensure stable and reproducible surface and tip conditions  for tunneling, the microscope will be operated in ultra-high  vacuum using a standard high-vacuum chamber system with a  full complement of surface analysis and preparation tools.  The microscope will achieve resolution on picosecond time  scales using the technique of tunnel junction mixing.  In  this technique, the intrinsic nonlinearity of the tunnel  junction between the sample and microscope in combination  with an optically-launched high-speed electrical pulse,  allows the detection and measurement of fast processes on  the sample surface.  Efforts to maximize the time resolution  available with this technique, and to push towards  femtosecond time scales, will require the use of nano-  fabricated tunneling tips with integral photoconductive  switches.  Research on the design and development of these  tips will be carried out as part of a collaborative effort  with the University of Alberta and the Alberta  Microelectronics Centre.  The effort at the University of  Alberta will also include the assembly of a 100 fs pulse  width Ti:sapphire laser system which will first be used in  the testing and evaluation of the microfabricated tips under  ambient conditions, and later combined with the ultra-high  vacuum tunneling microscope.      The development of this instrument will open up a new  dimension in scanning tunneling microscopy:  The opportunity  to probe systems on atomic time scales as well as atomic  length scales.  This capability will allow the study of a  wide variety of systems, including the dynamics of defects  in semiconductors and heterostructures, the nonequilibrium  response of superconductors, and the dynamics of structural  reconfigurations and charge transfer in optically excited  molecules.  The ability to carry out such stu dies will make  the scanning tunneling microscope a high-resolution probe in  all four (space-time) dimensions.",
