Pearcy, Jr.        The purpose of this project is to accumulate more knowledge leading to a  better understanding of the structure of operators on Hilbert space. In the  past eighteen years much progress has been made there by employing the theory  of dual algebras of operators, which the principal investigator helped to  establish. During the next two years, he plans to conduct research along these  same lines, and to supervise the research of three Ph. D. level students who  are writing theses under his direction.       Today's scientific technology depends on many sophisticated mathematical  concepts, including that of an operator on Hilbert space. The principal inves-  tigator and his students are engaged in research concerning such operators.  Knouledge gained from the investigations may lead to future advances in such  important technological areas as data transmission, seismic exploration, sig-  nal processing, and petroleum recovery.",
