The  principal aim of this conference is to encourage the  participants who  are investigating biological roles of RNAs in diverse  prokaryotic  organisms to address the key mechanistic and structure-  function  questions which will dominate the field in the coming years.  The focus  on mechanistic and structure-function problems is essential  if the  specific biological processes mediated by RNA-RNA and RNA  protein  interactions are to be thoroughly understood.  %%%  The meeting focus is timely in view of the immense diversity  and  current relevance of prokaryotic organisms as paradigms for  translation, RNA processing, modification and decay, and  their  regulation. Moreover, recent advances in elucidating the  structures of  RNA and RNA-protein complexes by biophysical techniques are  paralleling  the rapid pace of purifying the enzymes and substrates  involved in RNA  maturation, translation and decay. Accordingly,  presentations and  discussions at the conference will focus on RNA-RNA and RNA-  protein  interactions, formulation of mechanistic questions, and the  development  of new experimental approaches to understanding the  structural basis  for the biological functions of these interactions. In turn,  this  conference will serve to spur future mechanism-centered  experimentation  on these diverse systems. Attendance at the conference will  be limited to 155  participants. The speakers will be invited from among the  most productive and  innovative individuals in the field. Time has also been  allotted to permit several  selected outstanding younger scientists including junior  faculty,  postdoctoral fellows and senior graduate students to give  oral  presentations. The format at this conference has been chosen  to allow  a good balance between the two 3 hour oral sessions eac h day  and free  afternoon time for discussions and posters. Moreover, each  participant  is expected to attend the entire conference. The organizers  are  encouraging speakers to avoid presentations of previously  published  work but to focus on ongoing research, problem areas, and  emerging  models. It is the expectation of the organizers that this  theme will  encourage provocative presentations, lively discussion and  will  accordingly focus each participant's future research.  ***",
