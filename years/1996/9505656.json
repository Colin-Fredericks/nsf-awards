 "awd_abstract_narration": "American industrial and living standard dominance has eroded  away since 1950.  This fact implies economic convergence as  evidenced by the catching up of Japan, Germany, and now a number  of newly emerging economies.  Until recently, economists paid  very little attention to the contribution which the globalization  forces of trade, migration, and international investment have  made to this convergence.  Furthermore, they typically limited  their convergence measures to GDP per worker-hour, while  excluding factor prices like wages and land rents.  This project  seeks to repair those shortcomings.    There have been two golden ages of convergence for the OECD  countries: 1850-1914 and 1950-1994.  Previous NSF funded research  by the principal investigator has shown that the globalization  forces of mass migration and trade caused most the convergence up  to 1914.  It was also shown that convergence stopped between 1914  and 1950, while America fended off the challengers.  The purpose  of this project is to determine why convergence stopped during  those four decades when the pre-1914 open world economy imploded  into autarky.  In particular, what role did policy restrictions  on trade and migration play?  The findings should help guide any  effort to assess the contribution to convergence which the  retreat from autarky and the advance to global integration has  made since 1950.  It will also help identify the forces of de-  globalization which seem to be lurking on the horizon of the next  century.",
