 "awd_abstract_narration": "The science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) faculty of Oakton Community College are seeking solutions to four problems:  (a) approximately one third of students enrolled in core SMET courses do not complete the first semester; (b) pedagogy is not always sensitive to the needs of an increasingly diverse student audience; (c) effective strategies and resources are not always institutionalized; and (d) core courses are frequently taught using traditional approaches with limited use of multimedia or group activities.  The project is building on successes in the humanities, nursing, and honors courses.    Oakton is developing a team approach to examine, revise, identify, and develop objectives, resources, activities, teaching strategies, and assessment tools for core courses in chemistry, biology, and mathematics. Each sequence of courses is being studied by an interdisciplinary team of 7 to 11 members comprised of full and part time faculty and assisted by students, business representatives, alumni, and students. The team approach to curriculum development is establishing an institutional process to extend course reform across multiple sections taught by diverse faculty. The new pedagogy includes more attention to the interdisciplinary nature of science, the needs of traditionally underrepresented groups, the use of technology, discover approaches to learning, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. The teams are each preparing a core sequence Guide that defines the reformed courses. Team members are implementing the reforms and then fine-tuning the Guides. They then serve as mentors, working with other faculty members to implement the reforms.    This project is resulting in improved core courses in science and mathematics. Because the problems being addressed are widespread, particularly in the community college sector, the project is significantly impacting the way science and mathematics is taught at Oakton and serving as a national model.",
