 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peter Galison:  Histories of Science/ Histories of Art    In November, Harvard and Boston Universities are holding a series of events designed to focus scholarly attention on the interface between histories of science and histories of art, and to bring public attention to the issues of culture and technology -- both how culture views technology and how created technologies produced specific cultural forms.  Under this grant, Professor Galison of Harvard and Professor Caroline Jones of Boston University are convening an international workshop on these issues.  Participants are to discuss precirculated papers on specific themes that cross disciplinary boundaries.  Historians of science, art historians, cultural historians and philosophers are participating in the workshop to be held November 3-5 at the two universities.      This workshop promises to enhance the growing intellectual exchange between historians of art and science, thus bridging the gap between programs in NSF and the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities.  The workshop will provide a forum for this emerging interdisciplinary area and promote a fertile exchange of ideas which may form a basis for assessing past accomplishments and an opening on the wealth of new questions that are appearing.",
