The  First Conference (ICDS '95) was the inaugural gathering on this  subject and has demonstrated a strong interest in this subject  with over 70 papers presented from over 20 countries and close to  150 participants present.  The exhibit of the state-of-the-art  simulator equipment at the First Conference and a similar plan  for the Second Conference provide participants with a unique  opportunity to see demonstrations of the existing, and new,  designs.       With recent restructuring of the power industry, it becomes  important that efficiency and skills of the personnel to be  enhanced.  Digital simulators provide for an opportunity of  comprehensive study of various power system phenomena using their  interfaces that facilitate complex evaluations of new power  system designs and related control equipment.  The time consuming  and expensive approaches of the past where either field tests or  analog simulators are used can be substituted with highly  automated, low cost simulators.  The ICDS '97 is a unique forum  for discussion of the most recent issues in this area.       The U.S.A. academic institutions have had very little access  to advanced analog simulators in the past due to the excessive  cost. Today, low cost digital simulators can be developed at the  universities using readily available tools.  A need to educate  students in this important area is pressing since this can lead  to their interest in developing and/or using such equipment in  the future.       This proposal is aimed at supporting travel of the  interested students to the conference to present and/or to  participate in va rious discussions and presentations.  ***",
