 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two widely grown grass species native to the western U. S. (Elymus glaucus and Nassella pulchra) will be used as model systems to determine the extent of adaptation across environmental gradients from coastal to interior sites in California.   Adaptation to local environments will be determined in a series of reciprocal transplant experiments.  If grass populations are found to be adapted to the local environment, this would indicate that seed should not be transferred outside of these regions. We will also determine the capacity of non-local populations to evolve the attributes of the local populations.  Results of these studies will have broad implications for use of native grass germplasm.  If populations are able to evolve in this manner, strict maintenance of the integrity of existing populations may in some situations be a lower priority than seed collection methods that maximize the amount of genetic variation in the initial collection.    The proposed research will significantly increase the current understanding of the importance of different aspects of native grass adaptation to habitat restoration.  Knowledge of 1) the spatial scales of local adaptation, 2) the evolutionary potential for further adaptation, 3) the evolutionary consequences of genetic contamination, and 4) the potential for unwanted genetic shifts in seed production will enhance the chances of successful establishment of native grass species.  An increase in the use of these native species will promote the maintenance of biodiversity and facilitate the restoration of ecosystems with both healthy ecological function and evolutionary potential. Findings from these studies should assist with developing practical solutions that benefit both the native plant seed industry and ecosystem health.",
