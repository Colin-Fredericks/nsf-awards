 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed instrumentation is-a state of the art protein sequencing  system. A major advantage of the ABI 494 \"Procise\" instrument is its  greatly increased sensitivity, allowing for reliable and extensive  sequence assignments to be made on femtomole quantity samples.  Additional advantages are the capability of running up to four samples,  and operation of the instrument through an intuitive Macintosh  interface, thus providing the potential for its use as a facile  research and teaching tool.    The instrument will facilitate the research objectives of faculty  members in every department in the College of Natural and Agricultural  Sciences, and Agricultural Experiment Station at U. C. Riverside (see  descriptions of faculty research programs below). The existing  instrument at the UCR Biotechnology Instrumentation Facility was  purchased 10 years ago, and is very difficult to maintain operational  because of scarcity of spare parts and by the fact that the  manufacturer no longer offers maintenance services.    Investigators using the sequencer are engaged in a variety of  research topic, including the characterization of protein kinases, ion  channel toxins, developmental hormones, fertilization proteins,  pathogenic bacterial proteins, polyamine transporters, and cytokines.    A second motivation for acquisition of this instrument is the  commitment on the part of College to provide a means of training  students in current technologies of protein analysis. As recent events  have illustrated, opportunities for appropriately trained personnel are  becoming increasingly available in areas of medical technology,  agriculture, and forensics. UCR has the opportunity to provide courses  and outreach programs that would bring this technology to the student  population. Students attending our institution deserve the best  training possible, and this instrument will provide our graduates with  access to current technology and a consequent advantage in their  employment searches.",
