The major components of this plan are:  (1) to build a  research group of graduate students; (2) to assemble  laboratory facilities and equipment; (3) to develop a  nationally and internationally recognized research program;  (4) to develop educational programs in graduate research  training as well as class work for graduate and  undergraduate students.  The research component of this  career development plan is interdisciplinary in the sense  that the system of study is natural or biological in origin,  but the aspects of this system that are of primary interest  fall into the realm of polymer science and materials  science.  It is proposed to investigate natural silk  spinning processes in silk worms and spiders so that these  incredibly efficient processes may to be used as models for  aqueous processing of genetically engineered biopolymers.  The techniques employed in this research will be mainly  electron microscopy, electron diffraction, energy dispersive  X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electron energy loss image  filtering (Gatan Imaging Filter) on cryogenically prepared  samples.  Using these techniques, structure will be  corrolated with protein concentration in the aqueous silk  solution and the concentration of various salts which are  naturally present in the silk gland, and are thought to  influence chain conformation and phase behavior.  %%%  The educational component of this CAREER grant involves  outreach to high-school students and teachers, summer  programs, and field trips.  Results from this research will  be incorporated into classroom teaching in order to  illustrate general principles of polymer morphology,  crystallography, electron microscopy, etc.  The techniques  discussed in classes are general techniques of polymer  science and materials science.  ***",
