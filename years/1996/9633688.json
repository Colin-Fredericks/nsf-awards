 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633688  Fisher  A major focus of marine geoscience research is elucidating global  chemical mass balance for dissolved species in the oceans. A major  uncertainty in these calculations is an estimate for fluxes  associated with fluid flow through convergent margins. For some  chemical species this omission is significant. Before better  estimates of global mass balances can be determined, the chemical  composition of venting fluids from subduction zones must be  determined and the diagentic reactions that form these fluids must  be understood. Recent work on this problem has focussed on  subduction zones characterized by large accumulations of  underthrust sediment. In such regions, however, the diagentic  reactions in the thick sediment sequences may obscure the primary  signal of fluids from the underthrusting ocean crust.    The present recommended project will focus on fluid flow and  chemistry of fluids from the Mariana forearc region. Sediment  accretion is minimal in this area, and study of fluid flow and  chemistry should provide an excellent guide to understanding  primary chemical signature of fluids derived from the ocean crust.  A combination of remote vehicle sampling, coring from surface ship,  and measurements of sediment heat fluid and pore fluids will  provide data from three areas in the Marianas where fluid flow  appears to be channelized along fault zones. In addition to  addressing significant scientific questions, the project will  provide important background information for proposed ocean  drilling in this region.  ***",
