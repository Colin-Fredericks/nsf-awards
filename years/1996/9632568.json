Such  infections account for more than 45% of hospital infections,  associated with indwelling catheters and surgery for joint  replacement, and bypass operations.  Such infections are  also more difficult to treat than conventional infections.  With over 200 million intravascular devices sold annually,  it is clear that infections associated with biomedical  devices pose a huge problem in clinical medicine.  Understanding the mechanisms by which the bacteria  responsible for such infections adhere to implants and  resist antibiotic treatment is an important step in  developine materials that resist bacterial growth, and  improving therapy for implant-associated infections.    The use of plastic materials for implants is not only  associated with risk of infection, but also risk of clot  formation (thrombosis), and inflammation around the site.  Little is known about the specific mechanisms that govern  the complex relationships between infections, inflammation,  and thrombosis.  Factors that may affect this relationship  are the surface chemistry of the device, the proteins that  may be absorbed from the blood after implantation, and the  surface chemistry of the bacteria and blood cells.    The focus of this research will be to investigate the  cellular adhesion and activation events that infection,  inflammation, and thrombosis have in common, and to  determine their individual effects on the other processes.  Specifically, the influence that protein and cellular  components of thrombi (e.g. fibrin and blood platelets) have  in mediating bacterial adhesion and colonization on  artificial surfaces will be investigated.  The effects of  adherent bacteria on platelet adhesion and activation will  also be studied.  Another important factor that will be  investigated is the change in the metabolic state of  adherent bacteria on thrombi and on implant surfaces.  The  adhesion, activa tion, and accompanying shape changes of  white blood cells in the presence of adherent bacteria on  chemically modified polyurethanes will be studied.  These  studies will primarily be carried out using an automated  viedomicroscopy system that allows the direct observation of  individual cells interacting with different surfaces over a  period of time.  The study of cell-surface interactions will  be carried out on both glass and polyurethane surfaces, as  well as model surfaces of self-assembling monolayers.    The information obtained in this work will provide a better  understanding of the interrelationship between implanted  devices, bacterial infection, inflammation, and thrombosis,  an how each process may influence the other.  Detailed  understanding of the mechanisms that govern these  relationships will lead to the development of biomaterials  that resist microbial adhesion and proliferation as well as  thrombosis.  Ultimately, studies such as these are important  in improving patient welfare and reducing health care costs.  ***",
