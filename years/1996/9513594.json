 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is the development of new  methods for determining the structure of small spherical viruses based  on x-ray scattering measurements. Research in this area is timely  because synchrotrons allow the measurement of qualitatively superior  data and new methods are needed in order to fully exploit the data. For  instance, it will be possible to study virus dynamics, e.g., maturation  and disassembly, in solution: the high intensity of the x-ray beam  allows the recording of a solution scattering pattern in roughly 100 ms  and the quality of the data, in terms of the ability to make low-angle  scattering measurements and the sensitivity of the detectors, is very  high so that a low-resolution structure can be reconstructed from a  single 100 ms snap shot and therefore the evolution of the structure  can be tracked.       This is an interdisciplinary collaboration between the principal  investigator, in the School of Electrical Engineering, and Professor  John E. Johnson, in the Department of Biological Sciences. It combines  image processing, applied mathematical analysis, and numerical  computation expertise from the electrical engineering side with  biological, biophysical, and x-ray scattering experimental expertise  from the biological sciences side. The major theme that extends through  all of the proposed work is the need to exploit the icosahedral  symmetry present in small spherical viruses. The principal investigator  has new mathematical results in icosahedral harmonics and methodology  based on these results will allow the development of reconstruction  methods which exploit the symmetry in a much more natural and  computationally attractive fashion than has been possible in the past.    Work is proposed in three areas:    Reconstruction of 3D low-resolution viral structure from solution x-ray       scattering patterns: A model of the virus is proposed which       exactly exhibits the icosahedral symmetry. An iterative recon       struction algori thm, which is an significant generalization of the       standard electron density modification algorithm, is proposed.       Significance: Successful reconstruction would allow easy low-cost       surveys of virus structure since no crystallization is required;       would provide new starting points for reconstructions of       high-resolution structures based on crystal x-ray diffraction       data; and, most importantly, would enable the study of virus       maturation and disassembly in the natural solution environment.    Nucleic acid packing and nucleic acid-protein interactions: Small       spherical viruses provide an elegant and relatively simple model       system for studying these problems. However, because the bulk; of       the nucleic acid in a virus does not exhibit icosahedral symmetry,       the protein is visible at atomic resolution in a high-resolution x-       ray diffraction experiment while the nucleic acid is not.       Therefore, in order to extract the maximum amount of information       concerning both protein and nucleic acid from the x-ray       diffraction experiment, it is necessary to use different models       for the protein and nucleic acid. Such models and least-squares       type algorithms for estimating the parameters in the models from       low-resolution crystal x-ray diffraction data are proposed.       Significance: Successful reconstruction will validate the       low-resolution crystal x-ray diffraction data, which is difficult       to measure, and provide an alternative view of the nucleic acid       distribution and its interaction with the protein capsid based on       x-ray diffraction rather than cryo electron microscopy data.    Refinement using incomplete crystal x-ray diffraction data sets: In  many cutting-edge problems the data set is       incomplete due to a limited amount of virus, limited synchrotron  time, or inability to reliably grow       high-quality crystals. Because the virus particle has icosahedral  symmetry, it follows that  the diffraction data       also has icosahedral symmetry which, in the simplest case, implies  that the data is 60-fold redundant. Data     that is 5-fold redundant  is typically sufficient to refine a structure. Therefore, large amounts  of the data (e.g.,       80%) can be missing and it should still be possible to refine the  structure. However, standard algorithms and       software require that a complete set of data be recorded.  Therefore, based on the 60-fold redundancy, the       incomplete data set is interpolated to generate a complete data  set. However, the current interpolation       methods do not exploit the icosahedral symmetry of the data and  are therefore inaccurate. We propose to       develop and implement more sophisticated interpolation methods  that will exploit the icosahedral symmetry.       Significance: Success in this work will allow the solution of new  structures from existing previously unusable       data sets.",
