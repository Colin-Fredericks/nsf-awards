 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of black holes and relativistic stars in general  relativity was largely developed during the period from the  mid 1960's to the mid 1970's.  However, in recent years many  important, new developments in this area have occurred as a  result of a number of independent lines of research.  These  lines of investigation include:  (1) Research associated  with the `Grand Challenge` effort to study the details of  black hole collisions by numerical techniques.  (2) Analyses  of the potential ability of LIGO and other gravitational  wave detectors to probe detailed properties of black holes  and neutron stars.  (3) New evidence from the Hubble Space  Telescope and other observations for the presence of black  holes.  (4) Theoretical analyses of the internal structure  of black holes, which suggest that the `inner horizon`  occurring in idealized models of black holes may become a  null singularity of a relatively mild type for realistic  black holes.  (5) Further analyses of the Hawking effect and  its analog in 2-dimensional theories, particularly with  regard to the issue of whether purity of states is restored  in the black hole evaporation process.  (6) Numerous  investigations in the contexts of classical general  relativity, semiclassical gravity, quantum gravity, and  string theory regarding the nature and origin of black hole  entropy.  To discuss these recent developments, a Symposium on `Black  Holes and Relativistic Stars` will be held on the University  of Chicago Campus on the weekend of December 14 and 15, 1996  (just prior to the Texas Symposium, also to be held in  Chicago).  The Symposium will consist entirely of two days  of plenary lectures of approximately one hour duration each  by V. Ferrari, J. Friedman, J. Hartle, S.W. Hawking, W.  Israel, R. Penrose, M. Rees, R. Sorkin, S. Teukolsky, K.  Thorne, R. Wald, and E. Witten.  The Symposium will be  dedicated to the memory of S. Chandrasekhar.",
