 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612035    Fragmentation of rock is important for many applications in  rock  engineering.  The excavation of underground facilities is  increasingly  sought to accommodate the complex demands of today's  society, and it is  important to develop new ways to safely and cost-effectively  remove rock,  particularly hard rock.  Very few mechanical excavators have  been designed  to operate in hard rock, basically because of a lack of  knowledge of the  cutting process.  This research will lead to an improved  understanding of  the basic mechanisms involved in mechanical breakage of  rock, and will thus  ultimately contribute to improvements in the design and/or  mode of  operation of rock excavation machines.    The main objectives of the proposed research are to develop  (1) cuttability  criteria and (2) and index test to evaluate the ability to  cut rocks using  mechanical indentor-type tools (such as disk cutters used on  tunnel boring  machines, TBMs).  The essential mechanism involved in the  mechanical  breakage of rocks by indentation is the development of a  crushed zone as a  prelude to the formation of tensile cracks, which eventually  cause chipping  of the rock.  The existence of this crushed zone imposes  constraints on the  efficiency or even the ability to cut rocks by mechanical  means.  Indeed,  compressive damage of the rock beneath the indentor limits  the magnitude of  the compressive stress required to initiate and propagate  tensile cracks.  ***",
