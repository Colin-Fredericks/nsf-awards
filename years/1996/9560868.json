 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses development of  a comparatively inexpensive system that can produce a tunable quasimonochromatic high energy photon source.  Because such beams can be polarized, have low emittance and small energy bandwidth, they are applicable to a broad spectrum of commercial and medical uses.  The ideas to be explored in this proposal can also be used to provide compact, stable, efficient, intense particle beams, further enhancing their commercial prospects.  The key elements of this proposal are the RF electron gun, recirculation of the electrons with acceleration, wigglers, chicanes and achromatic bends based on permanent magnetic materials, and the recirculation of the intermediate photons generated by the wigglers.  The technique of Compton backscattering to boost the intermediate photon energy gives the variable, quasimonochromatic source of high energy photons.  The basic goal of the Phase I effort is to design the photon source and simulate the behavior of the electrons and the UV photons as they circulate within their respective structures.   The purpose of Phase I is  to design and fabricate one period of the short period helical wiggler demonstrating the feasibility of a significantly improved wiggler capability both from the standpoint of wavelength and variable polarization.  Phase I effort will also develop detailed specifications for the magnetic, optical, and RF components of the design for Phase II testing at an existing facility.       RXD has identified a number of areas such as isotope production, nuclear waste remediation, food, water, and medical instrument sterilization, and accelerator based medical treatment of diseases, which would benefit directly and quickly from breakthroughs in access, safety, affordability, and flexibility such as might be provided with this photon source.",
