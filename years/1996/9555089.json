 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to:    1) Disseminate biology lessons that have been developed  for prospective elementary school teachers.  Each of the  lessons includes a hands-on laboratory activity, a computer-  based knowledge construction activity, and a Teachers Guide;    2) Develop and disseminate a multiple choice test for  conceptual understanding of biology that will be useful for  assessing learning among prospective elementary school  teachers, other non-science majors, and biology majors so as  to measure progress within a course and comparisons among  courses; and    3) Develop, refine and test several new biology lessons  designed to provide tools to elementary school teachers for  teaching about evolution through in-class studies of  population.  The biology lessons are organized into three laboratory  manuals: Molecular Biology; Organismal Biology; and 3)  Population Biology.  Each biology laboratory is accompanied  by  \"knowledge construction exercises\" supported by the  SemNet software.  These exercises provide guidelines for  organizing knowledge in the form of active, working mental  models and include a mix of  individual and collaborative  work.  Laboratories will be made available in both printed  and electronic form.  Potential users include undergraduate  instructors of prospective elementary teachers,  undergraduate education majors, pre-service and practicing  teachers, and other interested persons.  The project will  develop a two-tiered, multiple-choice test to measure  conceptual understanding of biology.  The first part of each  question will assess student knowledge about a biological  phenomenon such as ability to predict the outcome when a  carrot is placed in saturated salt water.  The second part  of the question asks the student to explain the reasoning  s/he used to make that prediction.  The test will be  developed using items that typically  provide a brief  description of a laboratory exercise with results (including  graphic representation), and that as k students for  interpretation.  Open-ended responses obtained initially  will be converted to multiple choice items in which  distracters represent common misconceptions.",
