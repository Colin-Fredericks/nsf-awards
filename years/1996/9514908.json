 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514908  Easley    This project studies the following important question:  What does  an individual do when confronted with a new potentially complex,  stochastic decision problem?  According to standard expected  utility theory, before making any choices the individual  determines all possible stochastic processes that could be  driving the states of the world and accesses a prior over these  processes.  As appealing as this theory is in relatively simple  settings in which no further learning need occur, it is difficult  to accept in complex settings.  This project develops an  alternative evolutionary foundation for static expected utility  maximization.  Within this alternative framework individuals do  not access beliefs over all possible stochastic processes.  They  do not even attempt to determine the set of possible processes.   Instead, they act and learn from their experience.  Here an  individual begins with a set of candidate decision rules, starts  with weights on these rules, and selects an initial rule using  these weights as probabilities.  She/he then acts according to  the recommendation made by the selected rule.  After observing  the state and the payoff that is achieved, the individual updates  the weights on rules using an evolutionary dynamic.  He/she  selects the rule to use at the next date based on these updated  weights, and so on.  Based on the work completed so far, it is  known that with three natural axioms on the dynamic: symmetry,  monotonicity, and independence, the individual eventually chooses  a rule that is a subjective expected utility maximizer with  correct expectations.  One part of the project is to determine if  these axioms are minimal for this conclusion.  This project  extends the process oriented model of choice to richer settings  and an analysis of interaction between multiple evolutionary  individuals.",
