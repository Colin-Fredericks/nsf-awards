 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program   in the Division of Chemistry, is directed by Prof. Dennis C. Johnson of   the Chemistry Department at Iowa State University.  The work utilizes    electrochemical cells containing doped metal oxide anodes whose   electrocatalytic properties will be exploited in a study of   oxygen-transfer oxidations involving polar organic molecules.  Oxygen   atom mediation is proposed by the PI as the mechanism by which these   oxidations proceed.  Experiments designed to provide evidence to support   or deny this mechanism will be carried out and digital simulations will   be used to confirm mechanisms.  Aliphatic amines, amino acids and small   peptides, many with functional groups containing sulfur, are the test   compounds. Working electrodes fabricated as disks suitable for the   rotated disk electrode assembly are used to obtain current-voltage curves   which can be analyzed for their mechanistic information.  The surface   topography of the electrodes is explored using the scanning electron   microscope.  To provide additional information to support the mechanism   studies, chemical analysis of the products of exhaustive electrolysis   will be done with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and   electrospray-mass spectrometry.  Electrode reactions in electrochemical cells produce chemical changes in   the ions or molecules which take part in the reaction but until the   pathway is known by which such a change occurs, scientific use of the   process is limited.  The objective of this project is to understand the   nature of reactions taking place at the anode of a cell which involve the   transfer of an oxygen atom to form a product. There are many examples of   compounds which might follow such a pathway including some of biological   interest and others of environmental concern.   Potential applications of   the knowledge gained are found in the area of sensors for chemical   analysis.",
