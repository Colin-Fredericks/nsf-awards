 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed work is to develop algorithms for  analyzing cardiovascular parameters in poultry.  Analysis of  cardiovascular parameters will help clarify the underlying  mechanisms which cause Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS) and other  economically important diseases in broilers.  SDS, or flipover as  it is called in chickens, is increasing in prevalence as a cause  of death in broiler populations due, at least in part, to the  control of serious infectious diseases and to increases in growth  rates.  It is hypothesized that low HRV may be an indicator of  susceptibility to SDS.  lf so, then it may be possible to predict  which chicks or embryos are at high risk for SDS.  These animals  could then either be culled from the flock before using resources  or growing to the point where carcass disposal would be a major  problem or be raised under slightly different conditions which  would be more likely to result in a viable product.    The  specific objective of the proposed research is to  test  the  hypothesis  that  male broilers with low heart  rate  variability  (HRV) have a higher incidence of SDS.",
