 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9612233  Dobry  Lateral spreading of sloping ground or of soil near a  waterfront is a pervasive and costly type of liquefaction  induced ground failure resulting from earthquakes.  It  causes damage to buildings, bridges, embankments, buried  lifelines, and, especially, port facilities.  Especially  important is the distress caused to pile foundations, as  illustrated by case histories in a number of earthquakes,  including the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1995 Kobe (Japan) and  Manzanillo (Mexico) events.  Accumulated losses due to  lateral spreading, including effects on piles and port  facilities, reaches the billions of dollars.  Although  progress has been made toward predicting, quantifying and  mitigating these effects, there is an urgent need for  improved evaluation procedures.    The project is part of a cooperative research program with  the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).  It  focuses on (1) geotechnical centrifuge model testing at  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) of earthquake-induced  lateral spreading and its effects on single piles and pile  groups (2) laboratory static and cyclic loading research at  UNAM on soil from Puerto Manzanillo (3) numerical analyses  of both lateral spreading and its effects on piles, and (4)  associated interpretations and recommendations, with  particular emphasis on port facilities.  It includes  centrifuge modeling at RPI of the Puerto Manzanillo case  history during the October 1995 earthquake, and further  evaluation of this case history based on the centrifuge  results and other information at UNAM.  The work of the two  groups is closely coordinated.    The numerical simulations of the centrifuge model tests on  single piles and pile groups subjected to lateral spreading  are performed at Cornell University.***",
