 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY  The Darling Marine Center is the marine laboratory of the  University of Maine System.  Since 1991, the University has  made an unprecedented financial commitment to modernize the  facility and to expand teaching and research programs to  benefit both University faculty and visiting researchers.  Lab and office space for visiting scientists has been  increased  5 fold, nearly all of the Center's 16 original  building have been renovated or improved, visitor housing  has been increased by 65%, a new dining hall has been built,  a shoreside Dive & Field Staging Building has been erected  to support SCUBA work, two additional classrooms have been  constructed including a new shoreside Visiting  Investigator/Classroom building, and the research library  has been expanded.  The inauguration of a formal Visiting  Investigation program in 1991 has resulted in an unexpected  surge of visitors that is increasing annually.  A concerted  effort has been made to involve visitors in planning future  facility improvements and, based on their evaluations, the  University has targeted three areas of facility weaknesses  at the Darling Center, two of which are the focus of this  proposal: 1) additional improvements to the small vessel  operation and  2) the upgrade of research instrumentation  for visitors.  This project will support the purchase of a  24' research vessel with enclosed cabin space for conducting  all-weather research and teaching activities, as will the  purchase of several research instruments that are most  frequently requested by visiting investigators will be  supported. The University will provide no funds to construct  a shoreside 40 x 50' x 20' Vessel Operations building that  will be used for repair, maintenance and storage of  the  Center's boat fleet.",
