 "awd_abstract_narration": "9631511  Gilly    Research on the giant axon system of the squid during the  past 50 years has provided the foundation for our  understanding of  communication within and between neurons -  nerve impulse conduction and synaptic transmission.  The  basic mechanisms governing these processes are shared by all  organisms with nervous systems, from jellyfish to humans.  Much remains to be learned about the dynamic interactions  that occur between individual nerve and muscle cells and how  these interactions change during the acquisition of new  behaviors.  Background work indicates that giant and non-  giant motor systems in squid can act independently to  achieve a large range of jet velocities or, in close  concert, to achieve super-charged jetting.  Experiments  funded by this grant are designed to examine the  interactions between these two motor systems during escape  behavior and to describe changes in these interactions that  occur shortly after hatching.  Preliminary work has shown  that these developmental changes are strongly linked to the  experience-dependent acquisition of prey capture behavior.    It is expected that this work will provide new insights into  how activity of specific motor nerve cells is coordinated by  the brain to produce complex behavioral outputs and how  development of this motor coordination is influenced by  experiences early in life.",
