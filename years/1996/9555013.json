 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of software engineering as we move towards the  21st Century is on Integrated Software Development. Large,  industrial strength, software systems that students are  increasingly required to work on involve systems  integration, interpretability, component-based software,  software architectures, and application frameworks. However,  if we look at the software engineering course contents at  universities, a number of the items listed above are not  covered in an integrated manner. The few that are covered  are dealt with in different courses, and no attempt is made  to provide integration of these concepts in a cohesive and  systematic manner. In this proposal, we focus on integrative  software development through a cohesive two course sequence  for sophomore and junior level CS students. There are two  main innovative ideas that provide the underlying foundation  for our proposal:  1.  Incorporation of the \"Component Based  Software\" development paradigm, and, 2. Incorporation of  \"Personal Software Process (PSP) \" concepts in an  integrated, cohesive software engineering course sequence.  This project is the first to evolve the state of the art of  software engineering instruction simultaneously along the  two most important contemporary dimensions in software  engineering. The PSP is particularly useful in attracting  minorities to this sequence of SE courses. The results of  our project will be of great interest to a wide audience in  U.S. Universities looking to advance their instructional  paradigms in the software engineering area.",
