 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brevard Teaching and Research Laboratories is seeking assistance  in the acquisition of  a Perstorp Flow Solution III dual channel autoanalyzer to perform  automated nutrient  analyses. There are currently several research projects underway which  would be greatly  enhanced by the acquisition of this instrument. These projects focus  upon the evaluation of  water quality conditions within the Indian River Lagoon ecosystem, an  estuary located on the  east coast of Florida. At present, Brevard Labs must rely upon tedious,  obsolete, manual  techniques to perform nutrient analyses, greatly limiting the scope and  success of these  research activities. Brevard Labs operates as a joint-use facility, and  all instrumentation is  available to the entire regional research community through an  open-door policy. As a direct  support organization of Brevard Community College, research training of  graduate and  undergraduate students, as well as visiting scientists, is one of the  principal missions of  Brevard Labs. As autoanalyers such as that proposed herein are  considered standard to  performing many research activities, the training made possible with  this instrument  acquisition will have wide-spread applicability.",
