 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529159  Aki  This project brings together a strongly coordinated group of  geologists, geotechnical engineers and seismologists from a  number of organizations to address geotechnical site  characterization and ground motion response issues resulting from  the Northridge earthquake.  The proposed work is heavily  leveraged by cost-sharing from the California Department of  Transportation, with additional cost-sharing from the Electric  Power Research Institute, the Southern California Earthquake  Center, and the U.S. Geological Survey, and with cooperation from  the California Department of Mines and Geology.    The objectives of the project are:  1) collection, compilation, and rapid dissemination of high-  quality site geotechnical and geophysical data to the research  community; and  2) focused analyses limited to the following:  * determining the extent to which local site and regional wave  propagation effects control strong ground motion, including  nonlinear site response;  * evaluating the adequacy of the conventional approach to  estimating site effects using: measured shear-wave velocities,  the results of laboratory tests, and one-dimensional equivalent-  linear and nonlinear analyses;  * assessing the degree of model complexity (2- and 3-D analyses)  required to adequately explain site effects; and  * determining the uncertainties in measured properties and how  these uncertainties affect ground motion predictions.    The research objectives are addressed in three phases by the  integrated group of geologists, seismologists and geotechnical  engineers.  Extensive coordination between institutions is  facilitated through a formal advisory structure.  In Phase 1, a series of geotechnical investigations are conducted  at significant sites of strong motion recordings and/or  structural failures.  In Phase 2, data collected in Phase 1 is evaluated and combined  with results of other data collection efforts to establish a  comprehensive database for modeling ground motion.  The aim is to   establish standard 1-D geotechnical models that include material  strain dependencies, as well as 2- and 3-D structural models.  A  workshop will facilitate coordination between investigators and  dissemination of data.  Phase 3 involves site response analyses of the data collected in  Phase 2, with comparisons made of ground motion response  calculations to Northridge earthquake observations.    The final report will document site investigations and site  response issues as well as all of the ground motion analyses  conducted.  ***",
