 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  Proposal: DMS-9622891  PI: Morpurgo     The main goals of the proposed research are:  1. Explicit computations of spectral invariants arising from the zeta function of natural pseudodifferential operators, in terms of conformal changes of metrics;  2. Analysis of such invariants on spaces such as n-dimensional spheres, tori, balls and shells, via either known or new sharp Sobolev or fractional integral inequalities.  Morpurgo proposes to carry out this research program for a large class of conformally covariant pseudodifferential operators on a compact manifold (with or without boundary), and for some non-conformally covariant operators, such as the ordinary Laplacian in dimensions greater than 2. The computation  will be effected via either variational or direct new methods developed by the investigator. The explicit form of the invariants on spaces like spheres, tori, balls and shells will then be related to either known sharp inequalities, or will suggest possible new sharp inequalities, to be derived by the investigator using symmetrization and end-point differentiation arguments.     Understanding how the spectrum of differential operators change as the underlying geometry is varied is a fundamental problem in mathematics and physics. The results produced in the research will provide concrete and direct ways to control the spectrum of conformally covariant operators in terms of the metric structure of surface, and vice versa. Such operators arise naturally in the study of many physical phenomena, in fields such as electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, and the theory of random surfaces.",
