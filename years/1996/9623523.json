 "awd_abstract_narration": "9623523  Mueller    The objective of this research is to examine the population dynamics and species diversity of fungi which decompose resources, such as wood, leaves, or dung, which are distributed in discrete patches.  Ecologists have concluded from models of consumer species (e.g., plants, herbivore, etc.) that patchiness can allow two species to coexist on a regional scale even if they cannot coexist on a local scale, but there has been no comparable work with decomposers.  For this study, consumer based models have been altered to make them applicable to decomposers.  The decomposer model predicts that within a patch the outcome of competition is controlled by (1) initial resource density of the patch, (2) resource requirements of the decomposer species, (3) the amount of energy a species needs to reproduce, and (4) the efficiency of the species at converting resources to stored energy.  The outcome of competition over many patches is controlled by (1) the outcome of within patch competition, (2) the dispersal ability of the species involved, and (3) the rate of input of new patches into the environment.  It can be inferred from the models that those factors which promote coexistence of two species will also promote the coexistence of multiple species and thus increase species diversity.  A better understanding of competition between decomposers has many potential applications including:  (1) developing strategies to fight economically harmful decomposers, (2) determining how competition affects nutrient cycling, which could potentially impact agricultural and bioremediation practices, and (3) developing methods for conserving species diversity.",
