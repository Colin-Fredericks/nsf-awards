 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9626347  Woodroofe      The research concerns biased sampling models and   exponential time series.  In biased sampling models, the probability   of including a subject in the study may depend on variables of   interest--for example, the size of the subject.  Interest centers on   cases in which the inclusion probabilities depend on the variables of   interest in a monotone way, but without assuming that the inclusion   probabilities are known or known up to a few parameters.  The   research involves developing tests for the presence of bias,   developing estimation procedures when bias is present and   studying the properties of both tests and estimators.  Likelihood   and penalized likelihood are used to develop the tests and   estimators, and the properties are studied through a combination of   asymptotic analysis and simulation.  An exponential time series is a   stochastic process whose finite dimensional distributions form   exponential families.  For such process, the sampling distributions   of normalized maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically  normal, under quite general conditions.  The research involves   developing higher order approximations to the these sampling   distributions and using the refined approximations to form   corrected confidence sets.  Mathematically, the results take the form   of very weak expansions in which a Bayesian approach is used   to obtain approximations to sampling distributions.      Biased samples arise frequently in investigations that involve   searching for hidden objects, since the probability of finding an   object may depend on its properties.  For example, astronomers are   more likely to find a large bright galaxy than a small dim   one, and geologists are more likely to find a large oil well than a   small one.  Previous work on such problems has concentrated on   the case in which the inclusion probabilities depend on the variables   of interest in a known way.  The new research involves developing   data analyses that are appr opriate when the latter   relationship is not known and includes methods for estimating the   relationship from observed data.  The relationship is important,   because the number of objects not found depends on it in crucial   way.  The research considers exponential time series which  include classical time series, like stock prices and weather, but also   many others like adaptively designed experiments (experiments   that design themselves) and sequential clinical trials.",
