 "awd_abstract_narration": "9514402  Weiss    A U.S.-Latin American workshop will be given May 25-27, 1996  at the Universidade Federal de Rural, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  on problems in the area of time-resolved experiments in  photochemistry, photophysics, and photobiology.  Invited  participants include scientists from 9 U.S. states, Puerto  Rico, and 3 South American countries.  The workshop will be  coordinated by Richard Weiss from Georgetown University, and  Frank Quina of the University of Sao Paulo, with the  cooperation of the Inter-American Photochemical Society  advisory board and president. Moreover, 2 additional U.S.  participants will be selected competitively from junior  faculty and post-doc applicants.    The organization of the workshop, including the selection of  participants, promises a healthy interaction and the  potential for establishing new long-term collaborations  between U.S. and South American scientists. Because of  recent equipment acquisitions in several South American  photochemical research laboratories, this is an especially  appropriate time for establishing a baseline for where the  field is and where it is going.  As much of the workshop  focus will be on methodology, this also provides a forum for  interchange of experimental methods necessary for the proper  use of the sophisticated equipment.  ***",
