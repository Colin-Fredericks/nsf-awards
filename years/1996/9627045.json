 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627045 de Acosta  The investigator proposes to contribute to the study of basic  questions in Large Deviations related to some important  stochastic sequences or ppocesses.  This includes the development  of suitable abstract mathematical tools, the identification of  models which lead naturally to interesting large deviation  questions, and the computation of the analytical expression of  specific rate functions.  The scope of the project includes the  following situations:  (i) trajectories of Markov processes (ii)  trajectories of certain classes of semimartingales (iii)  empirical measures under various dependence conditions.  A  fundamental theme in Probability Theory and its applications is  the study of situations in which a sequence of averages  constructed from a stochastic sequence converges in some sense to  a deterministic limit.  Large Deviation theory deals with the  problem of estimating the small probabilities that the averages  will deviate from the \"typical behavior\" represented by the  limit.  Here are two situations to which the proposed research  has direct or potential relevance; (a) Probabilistic models are  increasingly used in analyzing the performance of complex  communication systems and computer networks. Large Deviation  theory (in particular, large deviations of certain Markov  processes) is a powerful tool in the analysis of rare events  (that is, deviations from \"normal behavior\") in large systems of  those types. (b) Large Deviation theory is very useful in the  analysis of rare events associated to thermodynamic limits in  several important models in Statistical Mechanics.",
