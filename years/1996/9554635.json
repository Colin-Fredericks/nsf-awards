 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mineralogy is the inaugural course in the geoscience curriculum,  but typically presents major obstacles to learning, and may not be  relevant to the contemporary needs of students or society-at-large.   This training workshop is designed to develop a variety of  hands-on, discovery-oriented laboratory exercises.  The goals of  the workshop are to develop new materials to make mineralogy more  accessible and relevant to our students, and to develop these  exercises in accord with modern learning theory.  Five different  types of learning activities are included: field experiences, \"dry  labs\" (mineral identification, crystal  structures), \"wet labs\"  (experimental exercises such as crystal growing), analytical  exercises (using XRD and SEM), and computer-assisted learning  (modelling programs).  Selected workers present model activities at  the workshop; the other participants rotate through 16-20 of these  new lab exercises at the workshop.  All participants develop at  least one new exercise, and these are to be field tested at the  home institutions during the following semester.  These exercises  will be compiled and submitted for publication by the Mineralogical  Society of America.  The product of this workshop will be a core of  instructors trained in new instructional methods and materials, and  a laboratory workbook of new exercises that may be used by all  students in the geosciences.",
