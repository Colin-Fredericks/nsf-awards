 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530609  Peltzer         This research project is part of the US Joint Global  Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at  (1) a better understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both  organic and inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2)  identifying the physical, ecological and biogeochemical  factors and processes which regulate the magnitude and  variability of these fluxes, and (3) placing these fluxes  into the context of the contemporary global carbon cycle.       This work is one of forty-four projects that are  collaborating in the Southern Ocean Experiment of the Joint  Global Ocean Flux Study.   The Southern Ocean Experiment is  a three-year effort south of the Antarctic Polar Frontal  Zone to track the flow of carbon through its organic and  inorganic pathways from the air-ocean interface through the  entire water column into the bottom sediment.   The  experiment will make use of the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer  and the R/V Thompson.       The five principal objectives of this component are  (1) to determine via shipboard measurement of both  dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total organic carbon  (TOC), and the spatial and temporal distribution of  dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Southern Ocean; (2)  to identify the sites of net DOM production and export; (3)  to estimate rates of net DOM production and export; (4)  to  estimate  rates of bacterial remineralization of DOM; and (5) to  place these rates in the context of the global carbon  cycle.       The net rates of DOM production and consumption will  be estimated by a combination of in situ measurements and  shipboard incubation experiments.  Large scale rates will  be calculated from a  combination of simple box and advection-diffusion models.  Routine sample collection will be accomplished via small  water samples drawn from 10 liter Niskin bottles on the CTD  rosette.  This work will have an emphasis on making large-  scale surveys and repeating these surveys on a seasonal  basis, and will be conducted in collabora tion with a  complementary study that emphasizes process-oriented  measurements of bacterial remineralization rates.       The Southern Ocean  is the only JGOFS study site where  the vertical stability is low, and where intermediate and  deep water masses are being formed.  This situation allows  the direct observation of the rate at which DOM is  sequestered in the deep ocean.  ***",
