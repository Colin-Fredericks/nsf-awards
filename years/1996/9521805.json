 "awd_abstract_narration": "9521805  Neumark        The aim of this research is to learn about how the properties  of semiconductor clusters evolve over a large size range,  spanning the molecular limit (10 atoms or less) up to the  nanocrystalline regime (1000 atoms or more). The proposed  experiments are specifically aimed at probing the electronic  and vibrational spectroscopy of these clusters as a function  of their size. The experiments will be conducted using two  negative ion photodetachment techniques: photoelectron  spectroscopy, for medium resolution (10 meV) survey work, and  anion zero electron kinetic energy (ZEKE) spectroscopy for  much higher resolution studies (0.2-0.3 meV). These techniques  combine size-selectivity with reasonable spectral resolution  and hence are ideal for spectroscopic studies of clusters over  a wide size range.  %%%  The spectroscopy of size-selected clusters offers an  unprecedented opportunity to understand how the properties of  matter evolve from the molecular to the bulk limits. This type  of work is appealing from the perspective of fundamental  chemistry and physics, since we can learn how the molecular  orbitals and vibrational frequencies of small molecules evolve  into the electronic bands and phonons in extended crystalline  structures. From a more applied point-of-view, small clusters  have been implicated in the problems that arise in the plasma  processing of semiconductors, and larger semiconductor clusters  are beginning to show promise for use in electronic devices.  Further characterization of the energetics and structure of the  species involved in these applications is therefore highly  desirable. This proposal is specifically aimed at mapping out  the electronic and vibrational spectroscopy of semiconductor  clusters over a wide size range, from less than 10 to more than  1000 atoms. To conduct this work, one requires experiments  which combine size-selectivity with reasonable spectral  resolution. This will be accomplished using two negative ion  photodetachmen t techniques: photoelectron spectroscopy and, for  higher resolution work, anion zero electron kinetic energy  spectroscopy.",
