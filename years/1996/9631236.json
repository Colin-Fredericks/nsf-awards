The goal  of  these  studies  is  to  elucidate and model the role of lattice vibrations in determining  the   superconducting  and  magnetic  phase  behavior  in   these  materials,  particularly  in  the copper  and  manganese  oxides.  Thermal  conductivity and thermopower will be employed as  probes  of  interactions  between the lattice and  the  charge  and  spin  degrees  of  freedom.  The evolution of these  interactions  with  charge-carrier  doping and their dependence  on  temperature  and  magnetic  field  are  a central focus of this research.  Analogue  systems  with  similar  crystal structure,  but  with  transition  metals  other  than copper and manganese, have been  selected  as  \"controls\"  in these studies. These include ruthenium and  nickel  oxide  compounds  for which the strength of electron-lattice  and  electron-electron interactions appear to be very different  %%%    This  research focuses on the physics of electronic  and  thermal  conduction in transition metal oxides, a broad class of materials  that  have attracted considerable attention in recent years  both  for  the  novel physics their properties manifest, and for  their  potential  use in future technologies. Of particular interest  in  this study are the interactions which control the superconducting  and  magnetic  phase  transitions in  the  copper  and  manganese  oxides, respectively.  These transitions vary with charge-carrier  concentration in systematic ways within each class of  materials.  Signatures  of  the mechanisms underlying these  phase  behaviors  will be sought in the temperature and magnetic field dependencies  of  the  thermal transport properties, where some anomalies  have  already been identified.  ***",
