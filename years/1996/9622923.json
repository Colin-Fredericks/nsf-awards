 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622923  Stredulinsky    The main goal of this project is to give a careful mathematical analysis of a  theory due to E.N. Parker on solar coronal heating. According to Parker the main  source of heat  in the solar corona consists of very thin regions of intense  current (current sheets) which arise as a mediation between the tendency of  coronal plasma to relax to equilibrium, and certain topological constraints.  Such constraints arise due to the near perfect conductivity of the coronal  plasma, and the anchoring of magnetic field lines at their footpoints or ends in  the dense gas of the photosphere, the footpoints being convected by the  turbulent motion of the photosphere. In attempting to understand the phenomenon  of current sheet formation in Parker's model a variational approach associated  with energy minimization will be used which relies on decompositions of magnetic  fields as a means of characterizing and prescribing field line topology. A  careful study will be made of which field line topologies withstand the weak  Sobolev space limits associated with the relaxation of a plasma towards minimum  energy. A general two-dimensional theory will be developed and applied to the  analysis of well known examples of current sheet formation in the astrophysics  literature. Beginnings of a fully three-dimensional theory will be described  with special emphasis on localized vector potential analogs of the flux  function representation of plasmas in two dimensions. Also topological  constraints involving helicity, and more refined measures of field line topology  measuring higher order linkage will be explored.  %%%  One of the outstanding open problems in solar astrophysics is the existence  of enormously high temperatures in the sun's atmosphere (corona), on the order  of two million degrees Fahrenheit, which have baffled astrophysicists for  generations. Though a number of reasonable models of coronal heating have been  explored the issue still engenders intense debate. In this project one  of the  leading models of coronal heating, due to E.N.Parker, will be analyzed on a  rigorous mathematical level. It is hoped that this will help resolve  uncertainties, and clarify the basic physical mechanism involved in coronal  heating.  Due to the relationship with sun spots and solar flares(violent  disruptions in the solar corona which propel plasma and associated magnetic  fields toward the earth), the issue of coronal heating is directly tied to  practical issues of variations in the earth's climate and electromagnetic  interference.  ***",
