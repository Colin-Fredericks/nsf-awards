 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630909  Stein  This project will implement, over a period of two years, an information management data model that has been developed by the PIs and collaborators at no cost to NSF.  The strength and uniqueness of this data model is its ability to integrate, into a single processing environment, multiple specimen catalogs and to track individual specimen parts and collections objects. The hardware and software choices were selected in part because they are scaleable and portable to computing platforms that are common throughout the collections community.  All intermediate and final development products, including design documents, annotated source code, and run-time programs, will be made publicly available on an open-access Internet server so that they may be freely adopted by other institutions. This project represents a conceptual and technical advance in the managment of natural history collections information by extending community approaches.  The solution developed here will be applicable within many institutions nation- and world-wide.  Therefore, this project is being conducted not only in partnership between the University of California at Berkeley and the NSF, but also among institutions, and between programs and divisions within the NSF (funding has been provided by the Database Activities and the Research Collections in Systematics & Ecology Programs).",
