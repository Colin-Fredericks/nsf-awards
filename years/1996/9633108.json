 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9633108  Mazumder   This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will investigate the surface finish, dimensional accuracy and residual stress in components made of H13 tool steel by a process called Laser Aided Direct Metal Deposition (LADMD).  The innovation in this new approach to rapid prototyping technology is fabrication by direct metal deposition of tool steel.  This makes it possible to produce tooling, for example, dies and molds, by deposition rather than removal methods.  Key questions for those using this technology for tooling are the dimensional accuracy and residual stress state of tooling, because of their affect on the life of the tooling and fit of components produced by it.  Another issue in die and mold manufacture is surface finish, a place where most of the layered manufacturing technologies are weak, but surface finish is important to the appearance of components and flow of material in a die or mold cavity.  This project will provide experimental data on dimensional accuracy, surface finish, and residual stress, by producing and measuring a standard rapid prototyping test part using LADMD.  Materials evaluation will be done in cooperation with Doehler Jervis and DCD Technology, firms that make and use dies.   The impact of this new approach will be reductions in lead-time for the manufacture of production parts that need special tooling, leading to more competitive and customized products to satisfy customer needs.",
