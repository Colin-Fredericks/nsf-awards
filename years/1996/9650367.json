 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1992, this college committed itself to expanding its program in Environmental Science. In order to respond to the growing importance of the hydrological sciences, the department is now taking steps to strengthen its laboratory and field program in this area. The department has recently upgraded its capability to perform water quality measurements by obtaining equipment for sample collection, for field measurements of mainly physical parameters, and for physical models of hydrological systems for laboratory use.   Specifically, the new equipment enables the Department of Environmental Science to add a lab to its current Hydrology course which will involve experiments with physical models in the laboratory and hydrological measurements in the field; introduce a stronger field component in the Introduction to Environmental Science lab; collect samples with state-of-the-art techniques for the Environmental Measurements course; and provide basic equipment for field-oriented studies leading to the senior thesis and other projects. Field studies using the new equipment may focus on local environments in the New York City metropolitan area, ranging from heavily polluted to relatively undisturbed sites (Manhattan, Long Island, Bergen County, Hackensack Meadowlands, and Hudson Highlands, in particular the Black Rock Forest Preserve).    Syllabi, laboratory material, and data generated may have an immediate impact on education and research at other institutions and will be made available over the Internet.",
