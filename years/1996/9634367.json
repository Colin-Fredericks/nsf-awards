 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN:  9634367  PI: Finkel     Gain control is a powerful process that is used in many  biological and engineering applications.  In a videocamera, the photodetectors   can only operate over a limited range of light levels, so in order to be able to  record in bright daylight and dim internal light, the signal must be  re-scaled to stay within a limited range of intensities.  A slightly smarter   system, used in more expensive devices, is to change the gain (how much the   signal is amplified) separately in each local region. Changing the amount of   gain in an adaptive manner allows signals to be extracted from  ambient noise. The same principles of gain control act in our visual system--   in a simple manner on the pupil to control light entering the eye, but in   increasingly more sophisticated ways as one goes to higher levels in the visual   cortex. Our goal is to investigate these mechanisms of cortical gain control to  better understand how the visual sytem works, and as a means of uncovering   new image processing applications.  The cortex has the ability to control gain not only based on spatial  location, but also in a context-dependent manner.  The response to a   particular feature, say a short line segment, depends upon what other features   are present in the image.  If the line segment forms part of a circle or an   extended line, the response is increased.  Psychophysical studies have   identified the conditions under which certain features \"pop-out\" and become the focus   of visual attention.  Recent physiological studies have shown that cortical  cells are exquisitely sensitive to small changes in the context of the scene.   It is believed that response changes are a result of a change in gain of   individual cortical cells, but the mechanisms controlling cell gain are   poorly understood.  We are particularly interested in differential changes of gain  among different cells in a neural population.  Most features are   represented, in the cortex, by a set of graded responses ove r a   population of cells.  The orientation of a line, for example, is   coded by a distribution of responses over cells that prefer various  orientations (vertical, horizontal, oblique).   We hypothesize that inputs   from stimuli in the visual image act to differentially change the gain of   cells.  A differential change in gain across a population would  lead to increased sensitivity--a better estimate of line orientation, or   whatever feature is being analyzed. This type of context-dependent gain   control could lead to enhanced discrimination of the salient features in   an image.  We will carry out a series of physiological experiments in  cat visual cortex to investigate this hypothesis.  We also will conduct   a set of computer simulations of various cellular mechanisms to test   our model.  Finally, we will build a prototype image processing  device, based on these findings, and apply it to real images.",
