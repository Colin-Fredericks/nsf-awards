 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630061  Boyd  The general goal of this research is to develop a better  understanding of relaxation processes, especially at the  molecular level.  Two approaches are to be used.  One takes  advantage of the impressive ability developed recently for  carrying out molecular level computer simulations of the  structure and dynamic processes in bulk, dense-packed  polymers.  The other approach is experimental and employs  the dielectric relaxation technique to locate and  characterize relaxation processes.  Part of the simulation  effort will be directed toward developing a better molecular  understanding of the melt to glass transition process.  Our  recent research showed that as the glass forms the dynamic  processes become spatially heterogeneous.  Molecular  dynamics (MD) simulations are to be used to characterize the  local structure and relate it to the chain dynamics.  This  will be done both in polymers that possess subglass  relaxations and those that do not.  In a more practical  vein, the simulations will be used to develop structure-  property understanding of the connection between the glass  transition temperature and chemical structure.  In fact the  use of MD simulations to predict Tg values from the polymer  chemical structural formula will be pursued.  Dielectric  measurements will be used to generate better data for  comparison with the MD results.  Liquid crystalline polymers  (LCPs) are an intermediate case between the broad classes of  amorphous and crystalline polymers.  MD simulations are to  be applied to main-chain thermotropic LCPs in order to  better understand the relaxation processes that occur in  them.  Another class of LCP concerns the case where the  mesogenic unit is incorporated in a side-chain.  Dielectric  studies are to be carried out to characterize the  relaxations in side chain mesogenic LCPs.  %%%  Polymeric materials form one of the cornerstones of modern  technology.  Amorphous polymers, both as glasses and as  elastomers, comprise an important compone nt of these  materials.  Their behavior as materials, including  differentiating between their glassy or elastomeric  behavior, is largely determined by the presence and  associated time temperature location of relaxation  processes.  In turn, relaxation processes have their source  in molecular motions of various types.  ***",
