 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes in information technology (IT) markets and technologies over the past decade have brought about rapid growth in competition in the computing and communications industries.  New firms have sprung up and existing firms from related industries such as entertainment have moved into the IT sector to compete with traditional equipment manufacturers, software firms, and service providers.  Advances in network technology and miniaturization of components have led to increasing emphasis on distributed systems and have opened up possibilities of convergence of computing, communications, and entertainment products.  These changes have also provided an incentive for corporations to emphasize development of new products and expansion of market share over support of IT research.  Combined with fiscal pressures to limit government funded research in all but the most basic types of  research, these trends have led to concerns that the United States will have increasing difficulty sustaining the information technology base.  The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) will establish a cross-disciplinary study committee to examine trends in R&D for information technology, determine whether a problem exists, and explore options for preserving the research and technology base.  In addressing the issue of sources of support for future innovations in IT, the study will examine the changing roles of industry, academia, and government in the IT research  enterprise.  By consulting with industry groups, government agencies, and representatives of successful consortia approaches in other industries, the committee will develop recommendations as to the most effective way to maintain a balanced IT R&D effort.",
