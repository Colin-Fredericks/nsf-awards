 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this accomplishment-based renewal in the Inorganic, Organometallic and   Bioinorganic Chemistry Program, Dr. Margerum will continue mechanistic   studies of non-metal redox reactions with emphasis on rapid reactions   between electrophilic halogen species and nucleophiles with nitrogen,   oxygen, sulfur and halogen donors.  The role of halogen-cation transfer   mechanisms, the correlation of reactivities with nucleophilicity, and the   effect of acid-base catalysis in these reactions will be examined.    Halogen oxidations of ammonia, hydrazine, and hydroxylamine, the reaction   of chloramine with formaldehyde, reactions between bromamine and   formaldehyde, reactions of N-fluoro electrophilic fluorinating reagents   with inorganic nucleophiles, and reactions of highly reactive   Ni(III)peptide complexes will be studied.  The use of a   pulsed-accelerated-flow, position-resolved observation instrument   developed in Margerum's laboratories makes it possible to measure   extremely fast reaction rates.   In this work Dr. Margerum will study atom- and ion-transfer reactions   which take place more rapidly than can be measured by conventional   methods.  The unique instrumentation developed in the PI's laboratory   provides the opportunity to measure these extremely fast reactions, which   have fundamental, environmental and biological significance.",
