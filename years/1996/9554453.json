Gardner, Principal Investigator  Title:  \"Using ASTER to Improve Math and Science Accessibility        by Students with Learning Disabilities\"                                   ABSTRACT    Students with visual processing learning disabilities typically  have difficulty understanding printed  materials, and math and  technical subjects often present the greatest difficulties.  This  project proposes to initiate the first phase in research designed  to develop the most appropriate interface strategies needed to  optimize ASTER and related audio-formatting programs for students  with learning disabilities.  ASTER is an innovative computer  program developed initially to present math equations in an audio  format for students with visual disabilities.  It is important  that students with learning disabilities participate in tests on  ASTER navigation during the developmental phase of this software  program.  Commands which might be intuitive to a student who is  blind might not be as easy for a sighted student with a learning  disability.  Student  volunteers from the pre-algebra course and  Adult Basic Education program at Linn Benton Community College  Benton Center will be test subjects in specific experiments  conducted to answer the following questions:  (1) What are the  most intuitive keystrokes to select sections to be read on the  computer, to browse from section to section, paragraph to  paragraph, etc.?  (2) What kind of computer screen display do  students find most helpful?  (3) What additional educational  features are useful?  This research project is conducted  collaboratively with the Science Accessibility Program at Oregon  State University which is improving ASTER as an aid to better  accessibility to math and science written material for students  with various disabilities.  Results from this project will be  used  in future designs of ASTER.  ***",
