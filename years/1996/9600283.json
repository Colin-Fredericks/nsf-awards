Dr. Schmitz will work with Dr. Tadashi  Yoshida, Director of the Macromolecular Science Section, on  a research project entitled \"Carbon Dioxide Reforming of  Methane\".    The proposed research will develop techniques used in  carbon dioxide reforming of methane to produce synthesis gas  (carbon monoxide and hydrogen).  Synthesis gas is an  important feedstock for production of higher-value chemicals  such as methanol, acetic acid and hydrocarbons.  Consequently, carbon dioxide reforming of methane is an  important step in the conversion of two greenhouse gases  into useful chemicals.  This reforming reaction can also be  used to store energy from a solar, nuclear or fossil fuel  source as chemical energy.  The energy can then be released  on demand by reversing the chemical reaction or by synthesis  gas combustion.  Carbon dioxide reforming of methane  requires high reaction temperatures (in excess of 500 =BAC)  where catalyst deactivation is an important concern.  To  identify promising multimetallic catalysts for development,  research will focus on the comparative performance of  candidate multimetallic catalysts with that of known  monometallic catalysts for carbon dioxide reforming of  methane. Catalyst activity and deactivation rate in the  reforming reaction will be evaluated using a quartz-tube  flow reactor.  Furthermore, a study of catalyst  physicochemical properties will be used to identify  deactivation mechanisms and to tailor multimetallic catalyst  compositions to achieve high activity and high deactivation  resistance.  Parameters of focus are identification of which  multimetallic systems show enhanced performance compared to  monometallic systems, and what relative metal concentrations  are required to optimize multimetallic catalyst performance.  ***",
