Contributions to the work will emphasize high-pressure measurements on the U.S. side involving special vibrating reed and torque techniques and, on the Czech side, high quality single crystal sample preparation and structural characterization.  Results are expected to improve our ability to study such intermetallic materials across the localization boundary.  In the course of this work, the researchers also intend to construct a refined high field vibrating magnetometer located at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida.    This joint research project in condensed matter physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe  to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.        ??",
