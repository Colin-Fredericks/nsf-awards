 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad goal of this research is to exploit the nature of both   the future communications traffic and the communications   channel in the construction of high performance receivers for   multi-user Code-Division Multiple-Access  (CDMA) signals.   Issues include bandwidth efficiency, receiver/transmitter   complexity, and quality of service (QoS).  Two main research   areas within CDMA receiver design will be investigated: multi   rate communications and channel equalization. In order to   accommodate a variety of potentially disparate sources (voice,   data and video signals), multi-rate communication schemes must   be developed. Possible sources such as voice, video, and data   communications have inherently different QoS requirements. QoS  parameters include: bit-rate, allowable delay, performance, and   source priority. The constant bit-rate paradigm of the current   wireless network will not serve such multi-rate services of the   future. The focus of this research is  to: (a) develop optimal   detectors for the various multi-rate access methods and   compared, (b) create performance measures which capture   QoS  needs will be constructed and (c) construct multi-user receivers to   explicitly exploit the redundancy in the mixture of narrowband and   wideband user signals. A major consideration is the distortion   induced by the propagation effects of  the radio channel. Receivers   to combat the effects of multipath and fading  will be developed and  analyzed. While equalization in the context of  wireless systems is a   well-explored problem, the novelty of this research lies in the   consideration of (a) parameter estimation methods necessary for   the accommodation of new users, (b) the specialization of   existing blind  equalization techniques for CDMA signals which are   achieved with moderate complexity, and (c) the development of   partially blind methods to fully exploit any information present   about the CDMA signals and the communication channel.",
