 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of a strategic plan to restructure the biology  curriculum to emphasize ways that scientists gain knowledge,  the Dept. of Biological Sciences at Feffis State University  will revise the one-year introductory biology course to  permit students to experience the methods of science--  formulating and testing hypotheses, designing and conducting  experiments, analyzing and interpreting data, and  communicating results.  The course will forge connections to  other disciplines and emphasize investigation.  Professors  from a wide range of disciplines will discuss research-based  CASE STUDIES with student research teams and share  interpretations of lab experiments via an e-mail BIONETWORK  on the University's WWW home page.  The conceptual theme of  the course will the biological effects of LIGHT.  Prospective biology teachers, biotechnology and applied  biology majors will be involved in the development and pilot  testing of the labs, then as research mentors to each of the  lab sections.  Prospective biology teachers will be assigned  to a special lab section of area high school students  enrolled under an educational partnership.  A major goal is  to develop a series of RESEARCH CORES--systems that offer  multiple options for student research teams to design and  conduct an experiment, analyze the data and present their  results using a multimedia \"poster\" There will be four 4-  week research units per semester, one in each of the  following areas--in genetics/cell biology, plant/animal  physiology, ecology/behavior, and evolution.  A development  team representing the disciplines of biology, chemistry,  physics, mathematics, geography and education will develop  the case studies and research cores with the assistance of  biology education, biotechnology and applied biology majors.",
