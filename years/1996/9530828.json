 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transition between hunter-gatherer lifestyle and subsequent sedentary Neolithic was a major  stage in human history, a stage that remains poorly understood. The proposed study will test the  hypothesis that sedentism in Europe began at the onset of postglacial conditions, and provide  further insights into the preconditions of the European transition as well as a more complete  understanding of skeletal adaptation to activity patterns. The consequences of environmental  changes for human subsistence at the European Late Pleistocene/Holocene transition are poorly  understood. Specifically, how did mobility change? This project will test the hypothesis that a  significant decrease in mobility occurred at the European Upper Paleolithic/Mesolithic transition  by examining changes through time in human postcranial skeletal structure, using cross-sectional  tibial and femoral properties that are directly related to activity levels (locomotion). Data will be  obtained from radiographs of the femur and tibia of osteological specimens in museum  collections. Molds will be taken at three locations along the the femur and the tibia.  Cross-sections at each location will be reconstructed, using the radiographs and molds as guides  to endosteal and periosteal contours. Each reconstructed cross-section will be digitized and  cross-sectional geometric properties calculated. Previous studies have shown that variation in  lower limb bone cross-sectional shape corresponds to differences in mobility levels and patterns,  reflecting subsistence differences. Correlations between various environmental, biological, and  cultural factors and observed levels of mobility will be examined.",
