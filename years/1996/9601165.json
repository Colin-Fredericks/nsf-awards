An important step toward understanding how we sleep and  dream has been the  identification of specific groups of neurons in the brain  that generate  these states.  An important next step will be to determine  how these  neurons interact.  This proposed work is focused on how  signals from  neurons that trigger dreaming and waking are controlled.  These cells,  which use the chemical acetylcholine to communicate with  their distant  target-cells, may also release this chemical locally to  regulate their own  activity.  Our experiments will test this possibility by  stimulating these  cells and determining if any released acetylcholine can  influence the  neurons in the immediate neighborhood of the stimulated  cells.  We will  also use a novel method to visualize these neurons with the  electron  microscope to look for possible chemical release sites.  This will allow  us to determine if these release sites make direct contact  with  neighboring neurons that contain acetylcholine or are  positioned at a  distance from these neurons and their processes.  The  results will help  determine if acetylcholine acts as a local feedback signal  and whether  this signal gets transmitted via classical rapid cell-to-  cell contacts or  via a slower and longer pathway through the extracellular  space.  Since  these two signaling paths have different spatial and  temporal properties,  our results will make testable predictions about the role of  acetylcholine  in controlling the timing of sleep and wakefulness.  Accordingly, these  findings will advance our understanding of the neural  mechanisms of  sleeping and dreaming.",
