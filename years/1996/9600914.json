 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600914  Ciuffetti  Research:  This is a CAREER Award.  A major goal of modern plant biology is a molecular definition of factors that regulate plant-microbe interactions.  The PI is investigating a disease called tan spot of wheat which is caused by the fungus, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis.  This fungus is pathogenic because it produces the host-selective toxin (HST) called Ptr toxin.  Unlike all other HSTs, Ptr toxin is a protein and the direct product of a single gene.  Thus, pathogenicity in this fungus is regulated by a single gene for toxin production.  Also, genetic evaluation of sensitivity to Ptr toxin has demonstrated that the wheat response to the toxin and consequently, susceptibility to the pathogen, is controlled by a single dominant gene.  The research component of this award is composed of four specific objectives which encompass a diversity of approaches including an immunological, biochemical, and genetical approach to the identificaiton of the site-of-action of Ptr toxin:    Objective 1. IDENTIFICATION AND GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF      DIPLOID WHEATS SENSITIVE TO PTR TOXIN.  Objective 2. PRODUCTION OF LABELED DERIVATIVES AND      BIOCHEMICAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE SITE-OF-    ACTION/RECEPTOR OF PTR TOXIN.  Objective 3. GENETICAL ANALYSIS OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE    TOXIN AND ITS SITE-OF-ACTION/RECEPTOR USING     THE YEAST TWO-HYBRID SYSTEM.  Objective 4. IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION OF THE SITE-OF-   ACTION/RECEPTOR OF PTR TOXIN.    Education:  Development of an effective academic career in the plant sciences requires integration of both research and education.  Oregon State University and the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology are committed to this integration.  In keeping with the mission of the University and the Department toward graduate and undergraduate training, the recruitment of underrepresented individuals into science, and outreach to the community, the education career plan is composed of four main objectives:    Objective 1.  INCORPORATION OF VIDEOM ICROSCOPY, COMPUTER     ENHANCED IMAGING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES    IN TEACHING UNDERGRADUATE PLANT SCIENCES.  Objective 2.  TRAINING GRADUATE STUDENTS TO BE MORE      EFFECTIVE EDUCATORS IN THE PLANT SCIENCES.  Objective 3.  COMMITMENT TO WOMEN AND TRAINING OF      UNDERGRADUATES FOR A CAREER IN THE SCIENCES.  Objective 4.  SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY.    This PI's research projects provide the underlying scientific subject for the education activities.",
