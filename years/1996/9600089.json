 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kleiman  Kovacs  9600089    This awards supports the research of Dr. S. Kovacs as a  post-doctoral associate of Professor S. Kleiman to work on  problems in complex algebraic geometry. He hopes to find a  construction for the relative De Rham complex for non-smooth  morphisms. He also hopes to study log flips of complex varieties  and to try to confirm Kollar's conjecture that certain Abelian  surfaces blown-up at a single point give cones which decompose  into non-trivial finitely generated part and a non-trivial  nowhere locally finitely generated part.     This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the  oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to  the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems  that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures  defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely  polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra,  but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is  extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved itself  useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer  science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.",
