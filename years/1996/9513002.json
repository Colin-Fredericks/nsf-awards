 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this proposal is to establish a multi-user instrumentation  facility for the fine-scale analysis of video-recorded orientation and  locomotory movements of insects, and the simultaneously recorded  underlying electrical activity of groups of neurons and muscles. The  entire facility will comprise the Peak Performance Technologies Inc.  2D/3D software, two 486 desk-top computers, color and low-light video  recording equipment (for recording behavior in 3 dimensions), the Peak  Performance Technologies Inc. automatic point tracking software, and a  video recorder and camera which has been modified by Peak Performance  Technologies Inc. for high-speed (120 frames/sec) recording.  Simultaneously recorded electrophysiological data will be precisely  synchronized with the video record using the Peak Performance  Technologies Inc. electronic synchronization unit. The  electrophysiological data will be played back with an 8-channel Vetter  PCM data recorder, and analyzed using Run Technologies Inc. Data Pac II  wave form analysis software. The ultimate goal of these  neuroethological studies is to understand the sensorimotor mechanisms  underlying complex movement patterns. These studies, using insects as  model organisms, will specifically address questions of, how the  development of circuits of identified neurons affect behavior,  associative learning and memory, specific brain structures and their  role in spatial learning and memory, integration of multimodal sensory  inputs and control of motor output, and plant-insect interactions and  their role in crop protection.      The major users of this equipment facility will be performing  fine-scaled analyses of the movements of animals with respect to their  environments, and the movements of the segments of the body and limbs  with respect to each other, in both 2 and 3 dimensions. These projects  involve the study of body postures and movements, and the neural and  muscular activity underlying them in: (1) moths flying freely (closed-  l oop conditions) in a laboratory wind tunnel and natural field  conditions, (2) in moths during tethered flight  open-loop conditions   activated by various sensory stimuli (pulse trains of pheromone  compounds, visual flow fields, mechanosensory inputs) or endogenously,  (3) and walking in different successive developmental stages (e.g.,  caterpillars and moths) of the moth Manduca sexta. Projects proposed by  minor users include: (1) quantification of the movement patterns of  freely walking insects as they interact with the chemical environment  on the surfaces of leaves, (2) high-speed video analysis correlating  the effects of changes in the intracellularly recorded firing patterns  of identified neurons on the head and neck movements of flies in  tethered flight, (3) orientation and movement of body segments during  visually guided learning in freely walking animals, and its associated  neural activity, (4) analysis of movement patterns used by  plant-feeding insects to locate their host plant, and the strategies  utilized by parasitic insects to locate their insect herbivore prey. An  additional use, yet to be explored, may be to analyze the growth and  development of single neurons growing in culture, video recorded  through a compound microscope.     The most important components of this facility are the Peak  Performance Technologies Inc. motion analysis software and the video  and computer equipment that interact with this software. This motion  analysis system has been designed to perform sophisticated analysis of  animals moving with respect to their environment and of separate  segments of the body or limbs with respect to each other. The motion  analysis software is also designed to interact with the  electrophysiological analysis software produced by Run Technologies  Inc., enabling the researchers to analyze the behavior of interest and  easily and precisely correlate it with appropriately synchronized  recordings from the muscles and nerves involved in the generation and  contro l of that behavior. Our current video recording and analysis  capabilities does not provide the level of spatial and temporal  resolution necessary to test existing hypotheses or formulate and test  new ones. Without the interactive components of the Peak system, the  work proposed can only be performed with a prohibitively large  investment in time and investigator effort.        A-1",
