 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, part of the Cross-Directorate program for   Multidisciplinary Research in Optical Science and Engineering, Tony Heinz   at Columbia University together with colleagues from several other   industrial and government laboratories will use optoelectronic techniques   to probe in the far-infrared spectral region excitations of molecules and   phonons in surfaces and thin films.  These researchers will develop and   refine coherent far infrared spectroscopy to study surface and interface   problems and will apply this technique to a wide range of hitherto   intractable measurements of surfaces and thin films.  Multiple reflection   and new waveguide geometries will enhance the sensitivity of the   technique for surfaces and thin films, and sum-frequency generation   schemes will mix broadband far infrared radiation with a spectrally   narrow visible wavelength laser pulse.  Ultrafast time-resolved   measurements will also be exploited in several studies.  Materials   systems to be examined include ionic dopants in polymeric thin films,   thin ferroelectric films, and marginal metals.  Surfaces and thin films involve a limited quantity of material, and   methods sensitive enough to study these systems are usually inadequate.    This research program will lead to new techniques for measuring very low   energy excitations at the surfaces of such condensed matter systems using   novel optoelectronic methods.  A broad cross section of materials and   problems will be examined which have significant technological relevance   and importance.",
