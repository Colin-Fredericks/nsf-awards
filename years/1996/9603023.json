They will be working with Dr. Carlos Quesada-Mateo,  Director of the Center for Research on Sustainable  Development, University of Costa Rica, and in Bolivia with  Professor Kathy Mihotek, Universidad Autonoma Moreno, Santa  Cruz.   The research project will analyze the trajectory of  species preservation efforts in Bolivia and Costa Rica over  the past twenty-five years, to explore to what extent  international conservation agreements have influenced  national policies, and by what means.   Specifically, they  will test two hypotheses.  First, to see if international  agreements have catalyzed changes in cultural values  regarding species preservation in Costa Rica and Bolivia,  and, secondly, find out if the international agreements have  precipitated concurrent changes in national conservation  policies.    While there exists a large and growing literature on  international environmental treaty making, little scholarly  attention has been devoted to the impact of treaties and  their associated organizations on national policies in  developing countries.  Successful conclusion of this  research will shed light on how conservation regimes can  work more intentionally to foster cultural value shifts  toward regime goals, and how international regimes can use  networks of domestic advocacy-oriented experts to facilitate  regime goals.   The results should make a substantial  contribution to the progress of the current research program  in the effectiveness of international environmental regimes  on state and substate behavior.  The work has the potential  to make a major advance in our capacity for studying how  networks of policy experts and the negotiators of  international treaties can affect conditions on the ground  in places removed from their direct sovereignty.  ***",
