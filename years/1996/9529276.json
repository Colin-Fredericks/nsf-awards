 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to the need of scientists and educators for assistance in developing courses and programs to teach responsible scientific conduct, the National Research Council will convene a meeting of approximately 30 scientific conduct instructors and curriculum developers, ethicists, researchers, and administrators, across the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, medicine, social sciences, and engineering.  The meeting will be a strategy session to consider what kinds of information educators need as they design their programs on scientific conduct, and how that information can best be put together in a way that provides them with meaningful guidance. To achieve that objective, the workshop participants will identify the needs of prospective educators involved in programs and courses on scientific conduct, and the kinds of information that will be most useful to them as they design their programs; examine a range of materials (courses, methods, textbooks) being used currently to teach scientific conduct, and discuss strategies for evaluating them; compile a list of candidate elements that might be included in a guide to assist educators in developing their programs, and discuss strategies for relating these to an instructor's choice of curricular materials or approaches; discuss options for designing an effective guide for educators.  Participants will consider how such a tool can be designed to have the most impact.",
