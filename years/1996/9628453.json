 "awd_abstract_narration": "9628453  Sack      This grant provides $31,081 as one-half support of the costs of  upgrading Purdue University's Earth and Atmospheric Science  Department's current Cameca SX-50 electron microprobe (EMP) with  a new computer and software for both automated mechanical control  of the instrument and subsequent X-ray image analysis and a new  vacuum evaporator used for chemical preparation of samples to be  analyzed.  Specifically, the upgrade will include a Sun SPARC 20  workstation and Cameca's SX-pack software package which includes  both mechanical control software and software for X-ray image  analysis and interpretation.  The new computer equipment will  replace an antiquated PDP-11/53 minicomputer that was supplied  with the EMP when it was purchased with support from NSF in 1972.  Software support for the PDP-11 computer is no longer available  through Cameca.  Their present vacuum carbon coater, also  purchased in 1972, experiences mechanical failures frequently and  will also be replaced.  This upgrade will allow this lab to  continue their highly regarded research program in mineral  thermodynamics and crystallography using a vintage but clearly  still useful EMP as the analytical centerpiece for major  elemental analysis of geological samples.   The upgraded SX-50  will also serve a broader community of both institutional and  regional users.  ***",
