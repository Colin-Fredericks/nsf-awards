The persons selected will  represent a cross-section of research areas being supported  by awards from environmental engineering and associated  engineering topics by the National Science Foundation.  Their responsibility will be to participate in sessions of  the conference appropriate to their research area and to  contribute to a report that will be submitted by the  Principal Investigator to the National Science Foundation  for potential use in program planning.    The International Association on Water Quality meets  biennially. Its sessions reflect the interdisciplinary  nature of engineering issues associated with treatment of  water to meet quality standards for its intended use, and  after use, to prepare the wastewater for reuse or for  discharge to meet environmental quality standards.***",
