 "awd_abstract_narration": "Until the present, major progress has been made in the field of high-performance materials, while comparatively little has been done in the development of advanced infrastructural systems.  The goal of this research project is to develop innovative, partially-cast-in-place High-Performance Composite Frame Systems (HPCFSs) by selectively using high-performance materials, including: (1) continuous fiber-mat High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concretes (HPFRCs) called Slurry Infiltrated Mat Concrete (SIMCON), (2) discontinuous fiber HPFRCs called slurry Infiltrated Fiber Concrete (SIFCON), and (3) High Strength - Lightweight Aggregate Fiber Reinforced Concrete (HS-LWA FRC).  The  research will focus on the development of high-performance composite (A) column members, (B) beam members, and (C) beam-column sub-assemblages consisting of both experimental and analytical components.  Behavior under (a) service loads and (b) service loads combined with laterally applied reversed-cyclic loading will be investigated.  Partially cast-in-place HPCFS will be created by developing novel, stay-in-place formwork elements made by encasing steel members (e.g., light steel shapes and/or steel tubes) into HPFRCs.  The stay-in-place formwork will also act as surface reinforcement, thus replacing conventional reinforcing bars.  The `core` of the member will be cast-in-place using HS-LWA FRC.  These developments are expected to lead to:  (1) simpler, faster and more cost-effective construction, (2) improved structural performance, (3) reduction in element size and weight leading to the reduction in dead load, earthquake induced loading and an increase in usable floor space, and (4) improved durability of the structure.  This is a project supported under the second-year program of research initiative on `Composite and Hybrid Structures`, NSF 94-154.",
