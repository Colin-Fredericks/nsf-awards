 "awd_abstract_narration": "9561606  Torti         This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensor which utilizes discrete counting electrodes and a suspended slider.  Precision displacement sensors have a multitude of uses in industrial processing, the operation of linear and rotary machines, robotics, and the semiconductor industry.  However, for well developed technologies such as cap-acitive sensors, factors like cost per channel, limited range, and sensitivity to gap medium inhibit their use.       The range of this sensor is limited by the linear extent over which dimensional tolerances can be met on the die.  Resolution is constrained by the fraction of the minimum feature size that can be interpolated with the processing electronics.  With the slider-to-target gap positioned electronically, variations in refractive index can be compensated and active guarding is obviated.  This design should increase resolution while reducing drift and decreasing cost.  It utilizes a three-layer nickel construction with a monolithically attached, tall facing electrode, fabricated with deep plasma etching.  Force attenuation is electrostatic.  With the electronics and MEMS integrated onto a common substrate, commercial devices could be manufactured inexpensively and compactly.  Phase I will identify promising geometry's, sensing and drive electronics will be designed, and test structures will be produced.  A full scale prototype is expected to be made in Phase II.",
