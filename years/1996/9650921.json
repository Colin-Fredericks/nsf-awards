 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Engineering is purchasing an x-ray diffraction (XRD) system for the study of material crystal structure and phase identification. An x-ray diffractometer is needed to complement major courses in the Composite Materials Engineering curriculum. These courses are Properties of Material, Composite Characterization Techniques, and Mechanical Characterization Laboratory. In these courses, students learn material science and material characterization and begin to understand the relationship between the internal structure of materials and the properties of materials.   For understanding the properties of engineering materials, one needs to understand their structure on the atomic and/or microscopic scale. XRD is a powerful technique used to identify the crystalline phases present in materials and to measure the structural properties of the phases. It offers unparalleled accuracy in the measurement of atomic spacing. In addition, XRD is noncontact and nondestructive and can be used in most environments.   The new equipment is being used to offer undergraduate students in Composite Materials Engineering hands-on experience in the analysis of materials at the atomic and microscopic level. The equipment is crucial for preparing undergraduate students in materials engineering with the basic knowledge that is highly needed for the analysis, synthesis, design, and processing of advanced materials. Advanced composite materials are nationally recognized as one of the key technologies in the next few decades.",
