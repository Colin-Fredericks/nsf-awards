Analysis of development  of  the  skeleton,  and some elements of  the  muscular  and  nervous  systems, in a monophyletic lineage,  the  amphibian  Order  Gymnophiona,  will  test the  general  hypothesis  of  correlation  of  reproductive  and  developmental  patterns.  Development  in  three  focal  species  representing   three  families will be analyzed.  One species represents  a  basal  family  with an oviparous, free-living larval life  history,  the  other  two  are viviparous (live-bearing with  maternal  nutrition).   One  viviparous species  is  terrestrial,  the  other  fossorial,  and  their  developmental  patterns  and,  consequently,   adult  morphologies  differ   significantly.  Consequently,  interactions  of phylogenetic  history,  life  history, habitat, development and function can be approached  and analyzed.  Comparative development of the skull will  be  examined  to  ascertain the basis of homology of  structural  elements,   and   the  degree  to  which   modification   of  development is correlated with the factors mentioned  above.  The microstructure of tooth development will be examined  to  understand the development and evolution of the unique fetal  dentition  of  viviparous forms.   The  development  of  the  vertebrae  will  be  studied to  test  the  hypothesis  that  resegmentation is a fundamental property of development, and  to   determine  the  process  by  which  it   occurs.    The  development   of  specific  neural  and  muscular   elements  associated  with  the skeletal ontogeny,  such  as  the  jaw  musculature  and the hypoglossal nerve, will be  studied.  A  diversity     of     techniques    will     be     employed:  immunohistochemistry,  scanning  and  transmission  electron  microscopy, clearing and staining, and others.  A program t o  breed  caecilians in captivity will be established in  order  to:  (1)  provide  means  of  examining  the  diversity   of  reproductive  modes in the lineage; (2) provide  embryos  at  crucial  developmental stages for study; and (3) assure  the  maintenance of species threatened in their natural habitats.  This is an integrative study that should lead to significant  advancement  in  the search to understand  the  relationship  between reproduction, development and evolution",
