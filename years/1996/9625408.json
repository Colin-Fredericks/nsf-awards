This travel grant will provide partial support for selected individuals from such institutions to attend the annual conference on Programming Languages Design and Implementation (PLDI).  In addition to the Conference, the participants will attend tutorials targeted specifically to teachers from non-research oriented institutions.  For the selected participants, SIGPLAN will pay the tutorial and conferences fees and NSF funds will provide for travel and subsistence costs.  ***",
