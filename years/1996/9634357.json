 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN:  9634357  PI:  Niebur    In order to avoid information overload, by far the largest part of the   input to our sensory organs has to be discarded by the brain, and only   carefully selected parts are allowed to influence behavior and to   reach long-term memory. This process is called selective attention and   it is the focus of intense research in psychology, neurobiology and   the computational sciences. In this project, we will design and test   analog VLSI chips which implement neurobiologically plausible models   of the attentional selection process that we have developed   previously. The system will be tested on standard visual search   paradigms as used routinely in psychological experiments with monkey   and human subjects.  Building such \"neuromorphic\" devices is expected   to greatly benefit the understanding of biological perception since   the designer of a working and robust system has to overcome, and thus   to understand, many of the same functional constraints biological   systems are faced with (noise, limited connection possibilities etc).   Also machine vision should benefit significantly from this work since   technical image understanding systems will be confronted with the same   problem of information overload as biological organisms are, once the   still primitive stage of computer vision (compared to biological   vision) will be surpassed.    --  Ernst Niebur, PhD                               Krieger Mind/Brain Institute   Asst.
