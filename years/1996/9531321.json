Students will be recruited from institutions across the nation, particularly from predominantly undergraduate institutions and with a maximum of three students per year from the University of Nebraska.  The research topics will be drawn from the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and multimedia interface design.  The program will involve seminars, research projects, and academic year follow-up.  The central activity will be the students' research projects during which they will conceptualize a specific problem within HCI, design a study to address the problem, instrument the study and run pilot tests.  During the follow-up academic year, students will be encouraged to continue with data collection and analysis, with the help of the PI.  Students are expected to leave the REU project with an understanding of the research process and the job of a researcher, an appreciation of creativity in science, and a sense of the excitement of scientific discovery.",
