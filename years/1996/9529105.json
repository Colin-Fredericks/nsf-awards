 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charles Harris is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in femtosecond   studies of chemical reaction dynamics in simple liquids.  Two main lines   of research will be pursued. The first line of research involves the   investigation of solute/solvent interactions of polyatomic molecules in   solution using femtosecond and picosecond infrared and visible laser   experiments as well as molecular dynamics simulations.  This work will   extend the work already completed on iodine in liquid krypton and xenon    to diatomic molecules such as diatomic iodine anion, iodine chloride and   iodine bromide in liquid krypton and xenon.  Infrared pump and probe   techniques will also be used to examine carbon-hydrogen stretching mode   relaxation times of simple polyatomic as a function of pressure in   krypton and xenon solvents.    The second area of study involves the use   of femtosecond and picosecond infrared and visible spectroscopic   techniques to study reaction mechanisms of several organometallic   compounds whose branching ratios and quantum yields are controlled by the   ultrafast energy transfer between solute and solvent.  These studies will   encompass  a broad range of mechanistic studies, including   carbon-hydrogen and silicon-hydrogen bond activation in transition metal   compounds and photochemical ring slippage of an aromatic ligand.  Since many commercially important chemical reactions take place in   solvents, it is important to understand  the influence that such solvents   have on the reaction dynamics.   A number of effects, such as solvent   cage effects,  vibrational relaxation and quantum mechanical tunneling,   that are not present in the gas phase, completely dominate condensed   phase chemical reactions.  It is important to develop reliable theories   for model chemical systems that can then be applied to improving the   efficiency of commercially important chemical reactions.  The work that   is being performed by Harris provides an important experimental basis for   the development of such theories.",
