 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632556  Adams  The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at  Carnegie Mellon University supports research on the study of  crystalline interfaces at a mesoscopic scale.  The effort  concentrates on grain and subgrain boundaries in two-component  polycrystals and is complimentary to investigations at the atomic  and continuum scales.  The seminal concept of the project is that  a bridge can be constructed between the character of grain  boundaries and certain of their intrinsic properties.  This  bridge will encompass the very large space of all physically  distinctive grain boundaries, known as fundamental zone.  The  mission is to construct mappings using automated microscopy which  link the intrinsic materials properties of individual grain  boundaries to their character and chemistry over the entire  fundamental zone.  The mesoscale of interest lies approximately  between 100 microns and 100 nanometer.  The anticipated progress  is likely to accelerate the world-wide effort towards a unified  structure-properties theory, linking structure-properties  relations from the atomic scale upwards to the continuum scale.  The MRSEC supports the development, operation and maintenance of  shared experimental facilities for materials research.  It  fosters research participation by undergraduates and pre-college  students, and is developing strong industrial relationships.  The  Center currently  supports 8 senior investigators, 3 postdoctoral  research associates, 8 graduate students, and 4 undergraduates.  The MRSEC is directed by Professor Brent L. Adams.  %%%  The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at  Carnegie Mellon University supports research on the study of  crystalline interfaces at a microscopic scale, also known as  mesoscale.
