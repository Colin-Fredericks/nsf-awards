Dr. Horecka will work  with Dr. Yoshifumi Jigami, Director of the Molecular Biology  Department, on a research project entitled, \"Studies on the  Interdependency of N-linked Protein Glycosylation and Cell  Cycle START in the Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.\"    The proposed research will investigate the inter-dependency  between asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation and cell  cycle START in the budding yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.  Asparagine-linked protein glycosylation occurs ubiquitously  in eukaryotes and serves to modulate the structure and  function of cellular and secreted proteins.  The variety of  roles played by N-linked glycoproteins range from yeast cell  wall components to mammalian growth factor receptors.  In  both yeast and mammals N-linked glycosyla-tion is required  for progression through cell cycle START, the point in late  G1 at which cells commit to a new round of DNA synthesis and  cell division.  Although the basis for this requirement is  unknown, its elucidation will reveal novel mechanisms of  eukaryotic cell cycle control.  Two specific analyses will  be undertaken in the research. First, a molecular genetic  approach will be used to identify genes that function to  connect the N-linked glycosylation pathway and the cell  cycle machinery.  Second,  the transcription regulation of  OCH1 will be further characterized.  Since the enzymes  involved in both N-linked glycosylation and cell cycle  control are similar in all eukaryotes, it is reasonable to  expect that the results from this project can be generalized  to mammals.  ***",
