 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important property of logic programming languages, such  as Prolog, is that their declarative semantics is largely  independent of the order of execution of different  operations in the program. The different operations can also  be performed in parallel. As a result, it is possible to  exploit substantial parallelism from Prolog programs,  written for sequential machines, without making any  modifications to them. There are various forms of implicit  parallelism found in Prolog programs: or-parallelism,  independent and-parallelism, dependent and-parallelism,  stream and-parallelism, data or-parallelism, data and-  parallelism. Research so far has only focused on exploiting  a single form of parallelism. This  project's objective is  to parallel implementation techniques that will allow one to  extend a high performance sequential Prolog system to  exploit the various forms of parallelism simultaneously. The  focus of this project is upon self-contained parallel  implementation techniques that are simple and that will  allow addition of the various forms of parallelism to an  existing sequential Prolog system in a systematic and  incremental way. The techniques  to be developed here will  be  tested and demonstrated  for efficacy by incorporating  them in the SICStus sequential Prolog engine. Relevant tools  for compile-time analysis will also be developed. General  runtime optimization techniques for reducing the parallel  implementation overhead will also be researched.  ***",
