 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clark Atlanta University (CAU) will continue to build its comprehensive academic, research, and outreach program in Earth System Science (ESS) through enhancement of its curriculum for undergraduate students. The overall objective of the ESS program at CAU is to expose a large segment of the University's faculty and students to the interdisciplinary nature of the interactions among the geosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and biosphere and their impact on policy. Once this objective is achieved, it is envisioned that Clark Atlanta University will, simultaneously, enhance the ability all students to critically think across academic disciplines and increase the number of minority students pursuing graduate degrees and careers in ESS and related areas.    The proposed program has four main elements. These are (1) faculty development in the interdisciplinary area of Earth System Science, (2) a post freshman summer research program, (3) the inclusion of interdisciplinary case studies in all freshman orientation classes and (4) further development and enhancement of two Earth System Science courses. Faculty members from the School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Education, and the School of Business have and will continue to collaborate regarding the development and implementation of the ESS program. When the plans for the ESS program are finalized and fully implemented, Clark Atlanta University will be assured of not only sustaining its program but developing a more scientifically literate population prepared to be full participants in a technology driven world.",
