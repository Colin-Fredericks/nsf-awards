 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present project is to prepare a database in electronic and book  form of phonological, lexical, and (to a lesser extent) grammatical  information on selected languages of northern Vietnam. We are  targeting languages or varieties unstudied outside Vietnam,  specifically those found in the far northwest of Vietnam:  (1) Kadai and Tai family   Bouyei/Yay (Giay/Bo Y), Laha (La Ha),        San Chay/Cao Lan, Bl./Wh/Red Thai  (2) Hmong-Mien   Hmong (Meo), Dao (Yao, Kim Mun), Pa-hng (Pa            Teng)  (3) Mon-Khmer   Khang, Mang       This project is significant because the Tai and Kadai,  Hmong-Mien, and Mon Khmer groups of extreme northern Vietnam  (Haut Tonkin) occupy a special place in the linguistic history of  East and Southeast Asia, but have remained linguistically poorly  known up to now. The goal here is to begin to fill this gap in  knowledge.       The end products of this study will be: (a) an electronic  database in MS-Excel format with lexical items in IPA  transcription and (b) a research monograph. The data to be  collected for this project could be quite important generally for  SE Asian linguists, linguistic typologists, historians, and  anthropologists studying the spread of languages and material and  non-material culture from China into SE Asia. It will also be  important specifically in clarifying: (a) the linguistic  developments that have led to modern Lao, Thai, Hmong and some  Mon-Khmer languages, (b) the nature of the proto-languages from  which they have descended, (c) the interaction of pitch and voice  quality co-occurrence phenomena, and (d) the terminological  confusion about genetic affiliation and place in the family of  some of these groups.",
