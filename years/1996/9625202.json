 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, there has been a great deal of attention in  the software engineering community on the development of  techniques and tools that provide support for the design and  implementation of applications to be distributed across  networks of workstations. Some of this focus has been on  support for initial development and configuration of  applications while  other research has focused on techniques  to support these types of applications at run-time. One  novel aspect of workstation environments is that the number  of processors available for use tends to grow and shrink  over time. This aspect has caused increased interest in  dynamic reconfiguration techniques that allow applications  to adapt to their changing environment.    Much of the current research in dynamic reconfiguration has  focused on reconfiguration environments and heterogeneous  process migration. This research is developing techniques  for supporting dynamic structural and implementation  changes. The work has three parts: 1) studying general  approaches to implementing dynamic structural and  implementation changes to applications, including those  changes that require process participation, 2) determining  what aspects of this task can be automated, and 3) building  tools to support dynamic structural and implementation  changes. The most promising approach is one that enables  mapping the old global state of an application to a new  global state based on the structural changes to be made.    This CAREER project includes teaching initiatives geared  towards introducing undergraduate students to issues in the  design and implementation of distributed applications. The  goal is to improve training in an area where many students  get inadequate preparation for industry positions that  require knowledge in this domain.  ***",
