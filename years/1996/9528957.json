The project will develop new ways to describe and predict  this softness quantitatively using mathematics, statistical  physics and computer simulations.  The research will focus  on two materials that show promise for improved prediction.  The first type are deformed elastic sheets, such as a wad of  paper, a distorted red blood cell or a crumpled fender.  The  amount of force to distort these elastic sheets will be  predicted by utilizing a recently discovered insight about  how the deformation energy is distributed in a deformed  sheet.  The results of this research will assist engineers  in designing sheets of materials which crumple in controlled  ways.  The second type of material to be studied will be  microscopic layers of polymer molecules attached to  surfaces.  Such layers are used to keep tiny solid particles  suspended in many widely-used fluids such as motor oil or  ink.  These layers resist deformation because of the  tendency for the flexible polymers to remain as random as  possible.  This drive to maximize randomness leads the  polymers to distort collectively rather than individually.  The research will predict how these layers distort in  various situations.  %%%  This theoretical research project will deal with two types  of materials.   First, sheets of elastic materials, such as  rubber, will be studied in order to determine how they  behave as they crumple under stress.  These results will be  important for predicting the behavior of a large number of  different materials as they crumple.  Second, the behavior  of polymer layers attached to surfaces will be studied.  These materials are used to suspend small particles, such as  used in motor oils.   The research will study the behavior  of these materials as they are distorted.  ***",
