 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes extensive revision and restructuring  of an  existing simulation course designed primarily for senior  computer science majors by:  1) developing an integrated set  of laboratory exercises using commercially available  software (GPSS/H);  2) incorporating these materials into a  formal laboratory manual along with related computer science  reference materials and instructions in the use of the  software; 3) implementing a pilot course using this manual  together with a single text in the theory of simulation; 4)  evaluating the new course by collecting and analyzing  feedback from students and faculty; 5) preparing a syllabus  and a detailed annotated course outline for the instructor,  keyed to the manual and the text; and 6) dissemination of  the prepared materials.  The materials developed will be  flexible and highly modular allowing their adoption or  adaptation at other institutions.  This project will be undertaken at the University of the  District of Columbia (UDC), a university whose student body  is 89% minority.  The instructional materials are designed  to be especially helpful to computer science students by  providing them with marketable skills in computer simulation  which can be expected to enhance their ability to obtain  professional positions with a bachelor's degree.",
