 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622195  Thompson         The University of Texas will operate the Research Vessel  LONGHORN during 1996 as a general oceanographic vessel in support  of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The R/V LONGHORN is a 103'  research vessel constructed in 1971 and stretched to its present  length in 1986.  The vessel is owned and operated by the University  of Texas and has a 1996 operating schedule of 91 days of which 66  are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  The remaining 25 days  support State of Texas programs.  The ship will operate primarily  in the Gulf of Mexico.         The LONGHORN is part of a fleet of ships used by the National  Science Foundation to support marine research.  Most oceanographic  research requires highly specialized equipment and extensive  support from the ship's crew.  An increasing number of research  projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a  ship and for which the ship must be specifically designed.  Such  equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance  and operation.  These vessels do not operate in the same manner as  general cargo or fishing vessels.  NSF supports the operation of a  variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research.   These vessels are operated by universities and institutions around  the country.",
