 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of  undergraduate  students in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program  offered by the Colorado State University in Biochemistry and  Molecular Biology.  Biochemistry/molecular biology employs the  methods of chemistry, physics, cellular biology, microbiology and  genetic manipulation to study the structure and function of  complex biomolecules, how these molecules generate the phenomenon  we call life, and how alterations in these molecules perturb the  living organism.  Because of its breadth, biochemistry/molecular  biology serves to integrate didactic and experimental material  learned in a multitude of basic science courses.  This REU site  program in Molecular Biosciences will enable qualified  undergraduates to do independent research projects in a range of  areas and using a variety of experimental approaches.  The  program is designed to (a) offer the participants a wide variety  of research areas from which to choose an independent studies  project; (b) offer project areas that are meaningful and exciting  to the student; (c) teach the student how to formulate and test  hypotheses; (d) help develop the ability to trouble-shoot and  problem solve when confronted with the unexpected; (e) instruct  the participant in state-of-the-art techniques and  instrumentation of biochemistry/molecular biology; (f) develop  the ability to communicate with one's peers concerning ongoing  research efforts as well as more formal presentations of  completed research projects; (g) provide, in our faculty and in  outside scientists invited to speak to the REU students,  appropriate role models that will reinforce the intellectual  excitement of a scientific career; (h) emphasize to all  participants gender and diversity issues that impact research  careers in science; and (I) render assistance to participants in  applying for graduate studies and fellowships.       This award will foster the continued education and training  of individuals  who will be part of the next generation of basic  researchers in the diverse aspects of biochemistry and molecular  biology.",
