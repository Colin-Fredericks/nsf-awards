 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626970  Wells    The Museum of Ophthalmology will develop \"Amazing Eyes of the  Animal Kingdom\", a 1500 to 2000 sq. ft. traveling exhibit that will  enable young people (ages 11 - 14) and their families to explore  the science of vision of humans and animals.  Following an  introduction about human eyes (structure and function) visitors  will then discover the diversity of eye designs within the animal  kingdom and learning how visual systems have adapted in response to  their surroundings.  Complementary activities will include and  interactive gallery guide for those who prefer a facilitated  experience; a trunk kit for use in a classroom, community center,  or other non-museum locations; and pre- and post-visit materials  for teachers.  The exhibit content and complementary materials will  be developed to complement the Science Framework for Californian  Public Schools, other state frameworks and The National Science  Education Standards.  It is anticipated that the exhibit will be  managed by the Association of Science-Technology Centers and will  travel to nine museums during a three year period.  It will open  June, 1998.",
