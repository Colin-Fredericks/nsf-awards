Parhi of the Department of Electrical Engineering at the  University of Minnesota and Dr. Takao Nishitani at the  NEC Computer and Communication Laboratories of NEC  Corporation at Kawasaki. This project funding will support  Dr. Parhi to spend nine months with the NEC Corporation in  Japan. During his stay, he will perform research on VLSI  digital signal processing and multimedia systems.  Dr. Parhi  has been studying design of high speed and low power circuit  and system implementations using VLSI technologies which can  be used in multimedia applications such as video compression  and graphics manipulation and animation. Dr. Nishitani's  group is developing several multimedia products ranging from  video compact disc (CD) system design to RISC processors for  digital signal processing (DSP) to beamformer for audio  applications to video coding and conferencing. Dr. Parhi  will combine his expertise on low power and high speed  design methodologies with applications and design activities  carried out at NEC to study high performance architecture  development for multimedia systems.    This proposal brings together research scientists from two  countries working in the area of VLSI digital signal  processing. The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to  learn about algorithms used in and the applications of  multimedia systems. This cooperative research will allow Dr.  Parhi to bring back expertise with him which can lead to  further research after his return leading to several  doctoral and master's degrees.  Therefore, this proposal  fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and  transfer of scientific knowledge through an international  collaboration.  ***",
