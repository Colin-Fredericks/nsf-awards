 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to establish a Nucleic Acid  Analysis Core Facility at the Medical University of South  Carolina (MUSC). The goal of this facility is to provide  non-disease-oriented, basic science investigators at MUSC access  to newly developed molecular biology instrumentation that will  significantly improve the progress of their research objectives.  The focus of this proposed facility is on the analysis of DNA and  RNA macromolecules. Much of the basic biological research carried  out today at MUSC, as in other universities, involves analysis of  genes, their mRNA transcripts, sequences controlling expression  of the genes, or translation of mRNA into protein products. In  all of these areas of investigation, the characterization of  nucleic acids is central. Thus, the proposed facility will have  broad application to fundamental molecular biology projects being  pursued by investigators in most research departments at MUSC.          The main objective of this facility is to provide  user-friendly access to three major instruments that will provide  automated DNA sequencing, automated DNA and RNA fragment sizing  and quantitation, and sophisticated imaging detection, for  analysis of electrophoretic gels and blots. The major proposed  instruments include an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer, an ABI Prism  310 Genetic Analyzer and a Molecular Dynamics STORM Imager. The  ABI 377 DNA sequencer will primarily be used to carry out DNA  sequence analysis on samples prepared by individual  investigators. Sequencing reactions will be performed by thermal  cycling, using a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermal cycler. The Prism 310  Genetic analyzer will be used to determine the size and quantity  of DNA restriction fragments and PCR products, which are produced  in gene mapping and cloning experiments. The Prism 310 will also  be used for DNA sequencing on occasions when no fragment analyses  are required. The Storm Imager will have a variety of  applications, inc luding quantitative analysis of Southern,  Northern and Western blots, analysis of gel mobility shift  assays, quantitation of CAT assays, and colony and plaque  screening. By housing these instruments in a shared instrument  facility and supporting their use with a trained technician and  an experienced director, we will be able to optimize the use and  productivity of these instruments and accordingly increase their  impact on basic research and research training at MUSC.          The proposed facility will also be an important educational  and research laboratory for a variety of training programs at the  Medical University of South Carolina. Within the laboratories of  the major and frequent user groups, there are 26 postdoctoral  fellows, 42 graduate students and an increasing number of  undergraduate science majors who will make use of the facility in  pursuing their science degrees and advanced research training.  The facility will also be used as a resource for students and  high school teachers participating in programs at MUSC aimed at  advancing science education at the K-12 levels in the State of  South Carolina.",
