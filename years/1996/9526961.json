 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526961  Schaffer       The investigator and his colleagues study predator-prey  models as perturbations of Hamiltonian systems.  Predation is an  important factor in natural and man-made ecosystems.  Recently, it  has been observed that two species predator-prey models subject  to seasonal forcing exhibit interesting behaviors in the presence  of seasonal variations in the environment.  Most interesting is  the fact that for certain parameter regimes there exist infinite  numbers of coexisting attractors corresponding to oscillations of  different period and amplitude.  In the face of continuing  perturbations from without, such a circumstance promotes the  likelihood of violent and unpredictable variations in system  dynamics, i.e., in the densities of predators and victims over  time.  Put another way, the mathematics suggests that small  variations in ambient conditions, for example, year-to-year  variations in the climate, can induce enormous and wholly  unexpected changes in species abundances.  Interpreted  biologically, the parameter regimes in question correspond to  prey populations the densities of which are predator-limited,  i.e., to the circumstance in which predators keep victim  densities well below their carrying capacity.  That such  regulation is not unusual is evidenced by the fact that victim  populations often explode when \"released\" from predation.  In  agricultural systems, such irruptions can be the unintended (and  economically catastrophic) consequence of pest eradication  programs.  From a mathematical viewpoint, strong regulation of  herbivore populations by their predators corresponds to \"weak  dissipation.\" Previous investigation of the two species model  suggests that such situations can usefully be viewed as  perturbations of the Hamiltonian limit, in which case the  dissipation is, perforce, zero.  Because these models include  seasonality, the equations are \"nonintegrable\" with the  consequence that the topology phase space is extraordinarily  complex.  The mat hematical questions thus relate to which aspects  of the Hamiltonian topology are preserved under weak dissipation  and to the rapidity with which these features are eradicated as  dissipation levels increase.       The present project seeks to extend the basic mathematical  model of predator-prey interactions in several directions.  The  generalizations include increasing the numbers of interacting  species and examining the consequences of weak dissipation in the  context of a patchy environment, for example, cultivated fields  distributed among old fields and woodlands.  In addition, the  investigator and his colleagues address agroeconomic issues -  namely, the feasibility of substituting generalist arthropod  predators for insecticides as a principal means of controlling  pest species.  The conventional ecological wisdom is that given  sufficient understanding of predator requirements, such a  substitution is both feasible and desirable.  In fact, the history  of modern agriculture is nothing if not the story of increasing  victim carrying capacity with the consequence that effective pest  control by predation would necessarily correspond to weak  dissipation.  The challenge, therefore, is to devise management  policies that allow for the effective control of economically  significant pests and, at the same time, avoid an increased  potential for devastating outbreaks.",
