 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513137  Haus    A three year cooperative research program is developed  between the experimental group of Prof. Kuon Inoue at  Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan and the theoretical  group of the PI at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  The  subject of our investigations is dielectric materials with  periodicity in one-, two- and three-dimensions.  The topic  combines the strengths of two groups to explore the  potential of these new materials for applications in  optoelectronics, especially pulse propagation and nonlinear  effects. The experimental group is engaged in a number of  experiments on samples whose lattice spacing ranges from  millimeters to sub-microns; two- and three-dimensional  samples are of primary interest. The Japanese group has both  microwave and optical characterization experiments underway  to  confirm specific theoretical predictions. The PI is  continuing numerical calculations and developing several  approaches from plane-waves to beam-propagation methods;  attention is devoted to convergence and reliability issues.  Analytical methods are concurrently being developed using  the multiple scales perturbation approach. The results are  applied to pulse propagation, dispersion and diffraction in  linear and nonlinear structures.  ***",
