 "awd_abstract_narration": "9624488  Little  This is an award to support research to be conducted by this  investigator on factors that influence the quality of indoor air as  affected by building materials that are the potential source of  volatile organic compounds of pollutional significance.  The  investigator plans on developing fundamentally-based, mass-transfer  models for three generic classes of building materials and evaluate  procedures that can be used to evaluate the quality of the  parameters that can be used in those models.  Methods he plans to  use include screening measurements for sample selection,  formulation of mechanistic mass-transfer models, solutions  involving analytical and numerical methods, dynamic microbalance  experiments to determine diffusion and partition coefficients and  limited, large-scale chamber validation procedures for the models  devised during his research.    The research proposed is expected to provide a sound theoretical  foundation for the characterization of a wide range of building  materials as sources of volatile organic carbon compounds.  The  models that are an expected product of this research may prove to  be especially useful in reducing the number of costly and time-  consuming studies of materials conducted in test-chambers.  The  proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 95-  118, Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program Guidelines  for Submission of Proposals.  As such, it not only addressed the  proposed research but related the investigator's career development  plan to the current state of knowledge in the field and of the  potential impact work supported under this award would result in  educational innovation and effective teaching in the investigator's  discipline.",
