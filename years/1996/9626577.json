 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing increasingly involves interactions between autonomous  and heterogeneous agents distributed throughout a network, agents  that have been designed separately, by different people, with  little, if any, knowledge of each other.  For such disparate  agents to work safely and harmoniously together, they must be  able to trust each other to observe certain unifying principles  and protocols.  Unfortunately, in such an open system one cannot  expect universal  voluntary compliance with any given principle.  If required, such a principle must be  imposed on all components  of a given system.  A flexible, scalable, and fault tolerant  mechanism for imposing such principles and protocols over open  groups of distributed agents is being developed under this  project.  This mechanism, implemented as a toolkit called Moses,  is based on the concept of law-governed interaction (LGI), under  which all messages exchanged between the members of a given group  of agents are governed by an explicit, declarative, and locally  enforced set of rules, called the law of this group.  Some of the  the potential applications of LGI are being explored.  ***",
