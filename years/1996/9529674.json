 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rob Coalson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the theory of   quantum dynamics with application to condensed phase and macroscopic   systems.  Coalson will employ computational many-body quantum dynamics   approaches to studies in two areas of research: 1) quantum dynamics in   condensed phases with emphasis on vibronic lineshapes and electron   transfer rates; and  2) electrostatic interactions between macroions in   electrolytic solution as relevant to charged colloid systems.  This   research seeks to achieve fundamental insights into such phenomena as   optical absorption of chromophores in condensed phase, the role of   nonequilibrium initial state preparation in electron transfer dynamics,   and electrostatic interactions of macroion / electrolyte systems at high   concentration and density.  At the same time, technologically important   applications such as the use of laser fields to control condensed phase   electron transfer rates will be explored.  Coalson's research will lead to a molecular level understanding of the   fundamental interactions of laser radiation with condensed phase systems.    This understanding could have important long range implications in the   area of materials synthesis and processing.",
