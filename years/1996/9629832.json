 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project at the University of Kentucky supports a cultural anthropology student studying how residents of rural communities in Bulgaria understand and manage biodiversity conservation.  The problem is to understand how global concerns about biodiversity conservation are mediated by local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and practiced by mountain peasants in Bulgaria.  Through studying the effects of variation in gender, age and ethnic affiliation, the student will measure levels of resource use and management and study the local meaning of concepts such as `nature conservation` and `environment`.  The site is an area rich in biodiversity.  Study methods include a baseline household survey of two local communities, a detailed study of natural resource use and economic activities of 20 households in each village, case studies of natural resource disputes and the collection of documents, as well as participant observation and formal interviews in local villages and in NGOs in the national capitol.    In addition to enhancing our knowledge of resource use and conservation activities in post-community Bulgaria and providing a local-level analysis of NGOs, this study contributes to the broader understanding of the impact of the transition from state socialism in Eastern Europe on rural land management practices, conservation efforts and civil society.  The project also increases the nation's expertise about this important region of the world.",
