 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glenn Martyna is supported by a Faculty Early Career Development Award   from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to study the   microscopic aspects of chemical reactions in the condensed phase using   theoretical methods and high speed computers. The goal of this research   is to exploit and test these modern computational modeling methods on   large systems and to compare the results with experiment. Reactions in   many different environments ranging from surface confined geometries to   bulk solution will be studied.  In particular, problems in electron   solvation, chemical reactions in solution, and the structure and function   of zeolites will be studied.  The education plan will incorporate   portions of Martyna's research as a supplement to both a first semester   graduate Statistical Mechanics course and a first semester undergraduate   General Chemistry course.   In both cases, the visual microscopic nature   of the computer simulations will be used to complement the standard   curriculum and increase the student's interest in chemistry.  It will soon become possible to study chemical reactions in the condensed   phase on a microscopic level using modern theoretical techniques and high   speed computers.  Reactivity will be examined in many different   environments including surfaces, bulk solvent, in confined geometries   such as found in zeolites, and in clusters.  Simulations of the type   being employed by Martyna  will ultimately lead to many improvements in   the development and manufacturing of new chemical materials.",
