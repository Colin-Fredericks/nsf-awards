This conference occurs every other year, alternating with the \"Plant Genetics/Gene Expression\" FASEB conference. The conference is chaired by three of the leading experts in the field: Terri Lomax, Ralph Quatrano, and Keith Roberts. The conference will highlight recent progress in signal transduction mechanisms in plants. Specific sessions include: signaling between the cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, and cell wall; signaling molecules in plant growth and development (two sessions); environmental signaling in plant pathogen and plant/microbe interactions (two sessions); cell:cell communication, and perception and transduction of light signals. This conference will bring together scientists (150) who are approaching plant signaling from different and complementary conceptual and technical approaches and will generate an interdisciplinary synthesis in this fast moving research area. This conference format will provide a unique forum for sustained, focused, in-depth discussions of emerging topics that are critical to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms controlling plant growth, development, and environmental responses.  %%%   This Summer Research Conference on \"Signal Transduction in Plants\" is the second  in a series of FASEB conferences.
