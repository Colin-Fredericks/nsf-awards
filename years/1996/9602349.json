 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the semiconductor manufacturing and wafer fabrication industries expand throughout  the western US, the demand for highly-skilled technicians grows. This expansion creates the  difficult challenge of upgrading course content and pedagogy, and providing adequate faculty  development opportunities among community colleges, the primary workforce providers, and  high school tech prep programs. The Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute's (TVI) Project  TIE, Training for Industry Education, will address this problem by holding twelve, five-day  seminars in which up to 120 community college and high school faculty perform semiconductor  manufacturing processes in a clean room environment.             TVI's Regional Semiconductor Manufacturing Training Laboratory (RSMT Lab) is a  cleanroom that has been built to meet industry demands for well-trained semiconductor  manufacturing technicians. Seminars, planned by an administrative team of industry (Intel) and  educational (TVI) representatives, will be designed to provide hands-on work in TVI's RMST  Lab, dialogue about pedagogy, and discussions with semiconductor manufacturing engineers,  scientists, and technicians. Participants will receive a resource packet containing a technical  manual, bibliography, and information on developing SMT degree programs and laboratories.  The target audience is community college and Tech Prep high school faculty.             TVI's primary partner in this project is Intel Corporation, which has built Fab 11, its  largest plant, in Albuquerque. Sandia National Laboratories is a secondary partner. Project TIE  will provide faculty a rare opportunity to acquire hands-on experience in cleanroom environment.  Improved and enhanced instruction and communication among community colleges throughout  the US are anticiDated results as faculty take newly-acquired skills and resources to their schools.",
