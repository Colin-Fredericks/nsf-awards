 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is intended to discuss the latest developments and  progress in the fields of product realization.  These include the  latest methodologies, tools, techniques, analysis software and case  studies from American industry as well as the most current research  topics, teaching methods, laboratory exercises, student projects,  problems sets and teaching aides for engineering undergraduate  courses.  The material presented can be taught directly in product  realization courses or be incorporated as modules in manufacturing  engineering centered curricula.  Product realization is becoming an  important element of global competitiveness in terms of achieving  high quality and low cost products at the shortest time to market.   Several tools and methods have become widely used for product  realization and will be presented and discussed with classroom  notes and lectures, software demonstrations and laboratory  exercises such as:  quality function deployment (QFD) or customer  driven engineering for focusing the product users' input into the  design specifications of new products;  reducing cost through  analyzing product design for production and assembly (both manual  and robotic) by comparing and rating alternative designs and using  the manufacturing process capability for setting the tolerance  limits and quality level for new products.  Several case studies  developed by world class companies to illustrate product  realization will be presented.  Leading product realization  advocates from these companies will share their expertise with the  participants through open forum and plant tours.  This program will  increase undergraduate faculty experience with these concepts and  encourage them to develop courses, capstone projects and  incorporate modules of product realization into their curriculum.",
