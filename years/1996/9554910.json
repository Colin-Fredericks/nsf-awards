 "awd_abstract_narration": "The second course in the standard Computer Science curriculum (CS 2) is often based on a theoretical study of data  structures without an integrating practical component. As this course migrates to an object-oriented approach,  students and instructors must be given materials to support a unified and application-oriented course. We propose  to develop learning modules that support an application oriented, apprenticeship learning approach to the CS 2  course. Each module supports a methodology that is inverted from the traditional \"learn a data structure and use  it in a program\" approach. Rather than studying data structures to use in applications, we propose to use applications  to study data structures. Each module supports an apprentice style of learning wherein students read and modify  implementations of data structures and application programs before writing them from scratch. Modules supply code  libraries and frameworks, explanatory material for students and instructors, and potential programming, lab, and  homework exercises. Each module supplies a situated learning experience that engages students from the outset by  providing practical and illuminating examples for how and why data structures are used. Applications are  interdisciplinary in nature, graphical where appropriate, and integrate several data structures into real-world  programs. Modules will be developed to support object-oriented (using C++) design and programs, but each  module will be developed as an Abstract Data Type (using C) to reach as wide an audience as possible. Three  institutions are collaborating in this proposal: a research and teaching oriented private university, a teaching oriented  public university, and a teaching oriented historically black university, ensuring that material will be accessible to  a wide audience. The modules developed will be made available electronically, as hyper-text documents, and as  published material to supplement traditional texts.",
