Specifically, the PI will focus on the synthesis  of   poly(vinyl  alcohol)  (PVOH),  PVOH  derivatives,  and  poly(vinyl  amine)  (PVAm)  derivatives  from   enols   and  enamines,  respectively.  One goal  of  this  work  is  the  conversion of acetaldehyde to PVOH, which de facto, is  the  synthesis  of PVOH from ethylene and oxygen.  The synthetic  approach   involves  circumventing  inherent  thermodynamic  limitations  by  approaching  conundrums  from  a   kinetic  perspective.   From this vantage point, many  thermodynamic  problems can be transformed into competitive rate problems,  and  hence,  remedied through chemistry  (e.g.,  catalysis,  conditions, etc.).  In the context of this proposal,  enols  (e.g., vinyl alcohol, and its substituted derivatives) will  be  rapidly  generated  under  meta-stable  conditions  and  polymerized  at a rate faster than they can tautomerize  to  the  more  thermodynamically stable aldehyde.   Alternative  enols will also be generated by the catalytic isomerization  of  allyl  alcohol  derivatives to the corresponding  enols  using homogeneous Rh(I), Ir(I), and Ru(II) catalysts.  %%%  Synthesis of important polymers from common and inexpensive  sources,   in  particular  on  synthesis  of  water-soluble  polymers  used in applications ranging from pharmaceuticals  to low VOC paints.  ***",
