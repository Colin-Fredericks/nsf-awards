 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630674  Castenholz    The goals of this project are to evaluate the negative effects of  ultra-violet (UV) radiation on photosynthesis, growth, and health  of  cyanobacteria  and  to determine the methods  used  by  these  microorganisms to survive UV stress.  Cyanobacteria (also  called  blue-green  algae)  are  the closest living  relatives  of  those  oxygen-producing    microbes   that   built    the    Precambrian  stromatolites   (1  -3  billion  yrs  ago)  and  that   accounted  eventually for the high oxygen values in the Earth's atmosphere.    The  investigators  are asking the question  of  what  biological  \"strategies\"  these  microorganisms use to  tolerate  current  UV  stress  levels  and  the  higher levels  which  would  have  been  prevalent  during this strictly microbial period of  the  Earth's  history.  They have been working on avoidance responses by motile  cells  and also on the effect of UV \"sunscreen\" pigments, one  of  which (scytonemin), is located in a sheath or capsule surrounding  the  cells of many species. The investigators have been  able  to  characterize  this  yellow pigment and  experimentally  show  its  great effectiveness in allowing cells to tolerate high UV levels.  This  pigment enhances survival of cyanobacteria under  the  high  solar  radiation of their natural habitats and may have  provided  the  protection  for  their growth, colonization,  and  evolution  during  the  Precambrian.   By  leaming  how  specific  organisms  protect themselves from this harmful short-wave radiation, we may  also   better  understand  the  nature  of  UV  damage  in  other  organisms.  Basic research of the type we are doing may  lead  to  applications in human health as well.  For example, as  a  result  of  previous work by the principal invesigator, scytonemin is now  undergoing  clinical tests in another laboratory  as  a  compound  with highly effective anti-inflammatory properties.    In   the  continuation  of  this  work  with  cyanobacteria   the  investig ators  hope to further understand the role of  scytonemin  in  UV protection in both actively growing and dormant cells, and  the  role  of various environmental factors in the regulation  of  scytonemin synthesis.  In addition, the investigators  intend  to  determine  the extent of metabolic repair processes required  for  UV  tolerance  in cyanobacteria that do not possess UV  screening  pigments.  In this line of experimentation the investigators will  also  assay  the  degree of damage to cells caused  by  \"reactive  oxygen\" (e.g. singlet oxygen) which may also be produced in cells  as  a result of UV absorption.  If this secondary effect of UV is  substantial,  we  will  determine the  role  of  cell  carotenoid  pigments (e.g. beta-carotene) in quenching this form of damage.",
