 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526483  Miller  The goal of this project is to investigate and develop III-V  semiconductor-based optoelectronic emitters, detectors, and electronic  circuits with improved performance. The approach focuses on an  important materials issue which affects many present devices and  integrated optoelectronic circuits: controlled heavy p-type doping in  an epitaxial structure, using carbon. Gaseous, carbon tetrabromide,  CBr4 will be used for carbon doping in solid source molecular beam  epitaxy (MBE). Stable, low-resistance p-type contacts, improved laser  lifetime, and improved heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT)  reliability will be developed and demonstrated.    The common p-type dopant for solid-source MBE is Be. At doping  concentrations exceeding about lxlO^19/cm3, Be can diffuse rapidly  during epitaxial growth and also during device operation. This  phenomenon makes it difficult to grow high-performance microwave HBTs  with good yield and reproducibility using Be, and also leads to a rapid  degradation in device performance. As a result, commercial suppliers of  epitaxial material grown by MBE find it virtually impossible to sell  wafers for use in HBTs. There is also evidence that a similar  phenomenon limits the performance of lasers grown with Be. The use of  carbon rather than Be in solid-source MBE growth will reopen the growth  of high reliability, highly p doped, high performance devices to this  technique.    The approach of this project is to use carbon tetrabromide, CBr4, for p  type doping in solid-source MBE growth. The project couples the growth  by MBE of AlGaAs, GaAs, AlInAs, and GaInAs materials on GaAs and InP  substrates closely to the design, fabrication, and testing of HBTs,  lasers, and detectors. This is an extension to optical emitters,  detectors, and device reliability of the principal investigators' prior  work on CBr4 doping.  ***",
