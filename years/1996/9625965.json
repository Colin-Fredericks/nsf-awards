 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625965  Martinez-Miranda    The properties of very thin films often deviate from the  bulk due to confinement and surface energy effects.  The  deviation from bulk properties depends on parameters such as  film thickness, strain and processing conditions and these  variations can depend on the depth within the film.  Many  advances in thin film processes are the result of advances  in the techniques used to characterize these materials.  The  development of high intensity x-ray sources has made  possible in-house studies of aggregate samples, quasi-  ordered materials, very small samples and thin films.  Currently in the Materials and Nuclear Engineering  Department at the University of Maryland there are a range  of problems being studied which depend on the  characterization of structure in the nanometer size scale.  This award provides support for the purchase of an 18 kW  rotating anode x-ray source and the construction of a small  angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) diffractometer.  The two ports  on the rotating anode source would be used for the small  angle diffractometer and for a thin film four  circle  diffractometer already available in the Department.  This  equipment will allow us to perform small angle analysis of  thin film and bulk morphology in the size range of 1-100 nm  and in-plane and depth profile analysis of thin films.  %%%  The on-going research problems which can be addressed  immediately by the use of the four circle diffractometer  would include:  thin films of liquid crystals,  semiconducting multilayers, films of metal aggregates and  disordered clusters, polymer nanofoam dielectric films, and  reactive polymer blend interfaces.  In addition to many of  the systems listed above, the SAXS system could be used  immediately to solve current research problems in area of:  structure of metal aggregates and clusters, structure of  highly branched dendrimer molecules and characterization of  reactive polymer blends.  All of these research areas are  current projects in the Dep artment where the application of  x-ray scattering techniques would have a dramatic and  substantial impact on solving outstanding structural  characterization and application problems in the fields of  electronic devices, optical display devices and polymer  blends.  ***",
