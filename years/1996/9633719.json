The main  objective is to develop a unified model which can  efficiently be employed to study not only the multi-domain  structures with competing short- and long-range interactions  in a single crystal, but also the multi-grain and multi-  phase microstructures in ceramic materials of technological  interest.  A continuum field approach is used and three  specific problems will be investigated: domain formation and  dynamics in ferroelectric oxides as a result of competing  electrostatic energy, elastic energy and domain wall energy;  the formation of nanoscale ordered domains in relaxor  ferroelectrics; and, the kinetics of microstructural  evolution in multi-grain materials driven by the reduction  in the total interfacial energy.  %%%  This grant studies an important fundamental problem in  materials research which has critical technological  implications.  Namely, analytical and numerical methods will  be used to study and understand the evolution of  microstructure in materials as they go through changes in  phase.  This is an extremely difficult fundamental problem  which directly impacts materials processing.  The particular  systems to be studied are ceramic materials in which control  of the microstructure has direct bearing on material  proerties.  Of special interest in this research will be  ferroelectric materials which have applications as sensors  and optical components.  ***",
