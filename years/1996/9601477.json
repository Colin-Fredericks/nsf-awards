 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from a consortium of faculty from six different  departments at the University of Minnesota and researchers from  surrounding institutions (e.g., the Mayo Clinic) and the  commercial sector seeks support from the NSF Academic Research  Infrastructure Program to assist in the establishment of a  cutting edge NMR resource. The University of Minnesota is  committed to a developing Program in Structural Biology that will  be housed in the new Basic Health Sciences Building scheduled for  completion in August, 1996. The NMR facility (4,000 sq. Ft.) will  be located on level one along with other integral components:  X-ray, EPR and other spectroscopies, electron microscopy, mass  spectroscopy, microchemical facilities and computational  resources which will include a supercomputer center sub-site. The  centerpiece of this application is the acquisition of a 1 7.6T  NMR spectrometer (1H resonance frequency of 750 MHz) as well as  upgrades of existing 11.7 and 14.2 T NMR spectrometer consoles.    Over the past few years, multidimensional and high field NMR  methodology has revolutionized the role that NMR plays in the  chemical and biological sciences. In recognition of these  developments, the University of Minnesota has pledged a  substantial commitment to the establishment of a premier NMR  facility to support its own faculty and those from other  academic/research institutions and the commercial sector in the  State of Minnesota. As part of this undertaking, it is proposed  that the NSF play a pivotal role in the establishment of a  broadly based NMR facility. An initial group of 14 scientists who  would use the facility has been identified. Research pursued in  these laboratories impacts upon a wide spectrum of problems  ranging from health to material science whose solutions are  rooted in the NMR structural elucidation of proteins, nucleic  acids, membrane assemblies and inorganic polymers.",
