 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significant advances in digital imaging technology  provide capabilities not otherwise available. The overall  objective of this proposal is to obtain a 16-bit/pixel  digital imager that will permit investigators in the Plant  Sciences Building at The University of Georgia to profit  from this technology. A single instrument that will provide  images of media labelled with both radioisotopic and  non-radioisotopic probes is requested. Supporting items  include a microcomputer essential for operation of the  imager, one high energy phosphor screen cassette for each  major user, one low-energy phosphor screen cassette to be  shared among all users, four chemiluminescence screen  cassettes to be shared among all users, a grey-scale laser  printer for routine and inexpensive output, and  site-licensed image-analysis software. All will be  integrated into an existing computer network that will not  only permit data to be moved readily from the imager to each  user s laboratory, but will also provide direct access to a  publication quality color printer and to a CD recorder for  archiving data.      The imaging system (1) will permit us to obtain  quantitative information with greatly enhanced sensitivity  and accuracy, and (2) will dramatically decrease exposure  times, permitting experiments to progress at a much more  rapid pace. Current usage of film for imaging media in the  Plant Sciences Building exceeds 4,700/year, indicating that  a digital imager will receive extensive and efficient use.  The instrument will be used primarily with DNA, RNA and  protein blots, labelled with 32p, 1251, 35S, 14C, or with  enzymes that yield chemiluminescence given appropriate  substrates. Research programs that will benefit from the  equipment range from mission-oriented (e.g., H. Roger  Boerma) to fundamental (e.g., Kelly Dawe). These programs  include the regulation of virulence genes in a plant  pathogen (Timothy Denny), intercellular movement of plant  viruses and intracellular movement of viral glycop roteins  (C. Michael Deom), characterization of root-knot nematode  secretions (Richard Hussey and Celeste Ray), genetic  improvement of pest resistance and stress tolerance in  soybean (H. Roger Boerma), use of molecular markers in plant  breeding and evolution (Gary Kochert), characterization of  two pathways of polyamine synthesis in plants (Russell  Malmberg), the genetics and cell biology of the maize  meiotic centromere and kinetochore (Kelly Dawe), and a  comparative evaluation of the phytochrome gene family and  its expression in tomato and soghum (Lee Pratt and  Marie-Michele Cordonnier-Pratt).",
