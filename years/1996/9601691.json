 "awd_abstract_narration": "9601691  Glazier    The University of Notre Dame will purchase a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to pursue research in the department of Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Physics.  Research problems include the study of the evolution of foams, their structures and the time dependence of their rheology;  the flow of liquids including foams in porous media; the imaging of flow in concentrated suspensions and their properties; the architecture of neural network as a source of information for the mathematical modeling of these networks; hibernating myocardium and fumarate reductase as a study of anaerobiosis and metabolic alteration; the design of selective MRI contrast agents and studies of tissue freezing and cryoprotectant distribution as a metabolic response.  The results obtained from these studies will support the research of the OLISAO program in the Department of Electrical Engineering which develops theory and numerical simulations to fit and process image signals.  These studies vary from theoretical to applied and form engineering design to neurobiology.  The support from LISA will aid in developing improved imaging technology and increase speed and accuracy in processing of data into images.  The proposed studies either require static imaging of prepared samples or study of the changes of images in time.    These projects can all be adequately performed with a vertical, high resolution NMR imagine spectrometer operating at 300 MHz (7 Tesla magnetic field) with the necessary accessories to acquire and process data.  The in-vivo probe (64mm working diameter) will monitor 1H at gradient strengths of 20 G/cm (at 40 A), suitable for high resolution 3-d imaging experiments on frog and for large scale hydrodynamics experiments.  The microimaging probe will be available with 0.4 cm to 2.5 cm coils for various nuclei, with microprobes for microimaging at a resolution below 100 um for use in high resolution materials science and bioc hemistry experiments.  Some of the hardware and software will require custom design for individual experiments.  Three NMR specialists will be present in the NMR facility, one devoted solely to MRI and one with extensive MRI experience, to provide support for experiment development and execution.    The current proposal includes 10 faculty, 5 postdoctoral, 12 graduate students and 5 undergraduate researchers.  MRI will also be used in undergraduate courses with an enrollment of about 65 and graduate courses with an annual enrollment of about 25.  ***",
