Low, Department of  Chemistry, Purdue University, to pursue with Dr. Youngsook Lee, Department of  Life Sciences, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Korea, for 24  months, a program of cooperative research on lipid second messengers in plant  signal transduction.  The collaborators propose to further their understanding  of the roles of lipid-derived second messengers in plant defense by (1)  testing whether addition of phospholipase A or C reaction products can  independently stimulate the oxidative burst in both cultured cells and in  intact plants, (2) determining whether elicitors of the oxidative burst also  activate phospholipases A and C in intact soybean and tomato plants, and (3)  evaluating whether mutant tomato plants that are defective in the  oligogalacturonide-induced oxidative burst are also defective in activating  these phospholipases.    Plant defense systems are activated upon exposure to pathogens or to specific  molecules derived from pathogens, termed elicitors.  One of the most rapid  plant defense responses identified to date is the oxidative burst, a process  whereby hydrogen peroxide or peroxide ions are released within minutes of  elicitor binding to plant cell surface receptors.  The experiments to be  undertaken in this project are expected to establish whether phospholipases A  and C participate in signaling the oxidative burst in both suspension cultured  cells and in intact soybean and tomato plants.  The collaborators are  experienced in research in the field of this project.  Dr. Low's experience,  however, is primarily with cultured cell assays, while Dr. Lee has  concentrated on intact plant systems.  Their complementary expertise will be a  valuable asset in this study of plant defense systems.  This project is  relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which  seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists  and engineer s through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills,  and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.   Korean participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science and  Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an international  cooperative dimension to the PI's research under NSF Grant No. MCB-9303929.  ***",
