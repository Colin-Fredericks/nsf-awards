The main objective of the proposed training and research plan is to develop innovative computational methods and software for applying high performance computing to fundamental problems arising in the analysis of remotely sensed image data.  This work will be conducted at the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) in close cooperation with Professor Davis (Computer Science), Goward (Geography), Ja'Ja' (Electrical Engineering), and Townshend (Geography), who are pursuing a number of closely related efforts.  The application to be developed is a high performance system for estimating net primary production (NPP) using the production efficiency model (PEM) developed at the University of Maryland.  The overall aim is to build a family of software modules that make use of a variety of algorithms to carry out geometric correction of images, to eliminate signals from extraneous sources (e.g. atmospheric correction), to sample spatially and temporally, and to generate derived geophysical properties.  The modules will be constructed using proven portable and practical high performance programming languages and libraries.  Our applications development will be conducted on two high performance computing platforms at UMIACS; a 16-node IBM SP-2 and a Digital Alpha cluster consisting of 40 Alpha processors networked via a Digital ATM Gigaswitch.  The Maryland facility has approximately 300GB of online disk storage and a multi-terabyte tertiary storage system.  ***",
