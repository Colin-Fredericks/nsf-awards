 "awd_abstract_narration": "The multidisciplinary nature of most environmental problems necessitates training in analytical techniques among a variety of students. The acquisition of a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) and growth chamber enhances the capabilities for environmental sampling and analysis among students of plant biology, invertebrate zoology, biological research methods, histology/cell physiology, genetics, and organic chemistry. The majority of students are being introduced to the GC/MS system in the organic chemistry sequence where they carry out individually designed experiments. The system allows for the continued conversion to and increase in the variability of microscale experiments and the development of the organic laboratory projects that have greatly stimulated student interest in environmental research. As the students continue their progress, they use the GC/MS and environmental growth chamber in the upper-division biology laboratory courses including the research methods course where students design, execute, and present the results of individual research projects to peers and faculty. The new equipment also allows for the expansion of the undergraduate student-faculty research program during both the regular academic year and the summer session.",
