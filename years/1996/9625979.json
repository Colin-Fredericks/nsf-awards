The work centers on the development of  variable stiffness structural systems using a novel semi  active continuous variable stiffness (SACVS) device which  varies the structural stiffness and frequency continuously  and smoothly, without inducing impulsive forces and  maintaining nonresonant state under seismic and wind  excitation.  The main objectives of the project are: to  characterize the non-linear dynamics of the combined linear  structure and nonlinear-SACVS device by developing  analytical models and calibrating these models  experimentally; to develop control algorithms based on  intelligent control strategies such as neural networks; to  perform shake table testing of the SAVCS device in a  structural system; and to evaluate the effectiveness of the  SACVS system by comparing its controlled and uncontrolled  response, and as compared to a fully active system.  Results  from this research will contribute to the development of  innovative semi-active continuous variable stiffness systems  and their application to structural control which will  require less power to operate and will overcome limitations  of existing control systems.  ***",
