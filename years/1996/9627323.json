 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627323  Von Jouanne         The general drive towards automated high efficiency and low  cost control of ac motors has resulted in an increased  application of solid state electronic Adjsutable Speed Drives  (ASDs) in all levels of the power system.  The recent  advancements in power electronic devices have enabled high  frequency switching operation and have improved the performance  of pulse-width modulated (PWM) inverters for driving induction  motors.         In a typical ASD application a rectifier and a high  frequency PWM inverter control both the voltage and frequency  applied to the motor and thereby achieve variable speed operation  over a wide range.  High switching frequencies (2 to 20 kHz) are  common with the present day insulated gate bipolar transistor  (IGBT) technology for power levels over 200 kW.  However, while  the high switching speeds and advanced PWM switching schemes  substantially improve the performance of the PWM inverter-fed  induction motors, the associated high rate of voltage rise  (dv/dt), of 0 to 600V in less than O.1 us, has adverse effects on  the motor insulation, and can contribute to bearing and leakage  currents.       In response to these problems, the objective of this  proposal is to analyze the effects of the application of ASDs on  the operation of ac motors, investigate mitigation techniques and  bring the results into the graduate and undergraduate power  electronics curricula as appropriate.  ***",
