The project is divided  into  three  parts. The first part deals with the low-temperature thermodynamic and  transport  properties in prasedymium systems where the lowest  crystal  electric-field   level  of  the  localized  4f  electrons   has   only  quadrupolar,  rather than magnetic, internal degrees of  freedom.  The  evolution   of   the  correlated-electron  ground  state   in   weakly  hybridizing  prasedymium intermetallic compounds  is  studied  in  the  second  part.  The  last part seeks to determine how the  renormalized  ground  state  at low temperatures changes under the influence  of  an  applied  magnetic  field large enough to suppress the  magnetic  Kondo  interaction.  This  part  of the research will  be  conducted  at  the  National  High Magnetic Field Laboratory using pulsed magnetic  fields  up  to  50  T.  The  results  are expected  to  provide  an  important  understanding  of the correlations associated with the low-temperature  hybridization  of magnetic and quadrupolar states with the  conduction  electrons.  %%%  The  PI  investigates the magnetic and electrical properties of  rare  earth-intermetallic  systems with unusual ground  states.  Correlated  electron  behavior  in praseodymium-intermetallic  compounds  will  be  studied.  Praseodymium is uniquely positioned  to  act  as  a  logical  intermediary  between the strongly hybridizing cerium and  the  purely  trivalent  heavier rare earths. The observation of  this  behavior  in  certain systems with unique crystal-electric-field ground states would  indicate  a new interaction between the 4f orbitals and the conduction  electrons.  Applied  magnetic fields also significantly  effect  these  ground  states,  the low-temperature properties will  be  investigated  using  pulsed  fields  that are large enough  to   greatly  modify  the  correlated  behavior.  This project is a collaboration  between  three  investigators at three different institutions. Sample preparation  and  basic  characterization  will be performed at  Ames  Laboratory.  Once  suitable compounds are made, they will be sent to UC Riverside for low  field  magnetic and electrical measurements down to ~50 mK and to  the  National  High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Los Alamos for  high-field  measurements up to 50 T.  ***",
