 "awd_abstract_narration": "UCSF has had a vibrant crystallography lab in the Department of  Biochemistry. The successes over the last years encouraged the  university to expand the Faculty Appointments in Structural Biology. In  1995, Brigitte Raumann, a Program in Biological Sciences Fellow, joined  as an independent researcher. In 1996, Wendell Lim and Jonathan  Weissman joined as Assistant Professors in Cellular and Molecular  Pharmacology. This expansion, and the natural growth in numbers of  graduate students and postdoctoral fellows working the structural labs  in Biochemistry, has virtually overwhelmed the X-ray diffraction and  computer facilities at UCSF. In this proposal we present plans to  augment the facilities for three dimensional experimental Structural  Biology for the Department of Biochemistry and to equip a new lab with  X-ray diffraction equipment and computers within the Department of  Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology. The proposed newly equipped and  updated labs, one in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and one in  Biochemistry, are to be in their use and structure, equally accessible  to all X-ray crystallographers at UCSF. An extensive computer system  built in three tiers is planned to permit computing also in transparent  and equivalent ways.    In the following narrative, we list the projects of the six principal  investigators and demonstrate the need for the new communal equipment.  The laboratory to house the new machines in the Department of Cellular  and Molecular Pharmacology will be renovated: a wall is to be added for  separating the core computers from the X-ray set, plumbing changed,  electrical installation and a safety enclosure will be huilt. The  projects, most supported by NIH grants to the P.I.s, are briefly  described in narrative form, with references to published work where  possible, and followed by a table defining projects and personnel. This  lists the individual projects by title, the principal scientists  working on the project and the status of the project. T he status  provides a brief summary of the current needs for data collection.",
