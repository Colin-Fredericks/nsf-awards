A testable model for the role of the two enzyme-specific chaperones, CBP3 and CBP4 proteins, in the assembly of the yeast enzyme has been outlined in the proposal.  Preliminary studies show that the CBP4 protein physically interacts with one of the enzyme subunits (core 5) and that the two assembly proteins interact. The model suggests that the CBP3 protein may interact with one (or more) subunits of complex III.  Subsequent interaction between the two assembly proteins would bring together two (or more) subunits of the enzyme, forming an assembly nucleus. This protein nucleus would be recognized by other enzyme subunits, and promote continued assembly of the complex. The model will be tested using a collection of cbp3 and cbp4 mutants available in the laboratory. Specific questions to be asked include whether the association between the CBP3 and CBP4 chaperones is a requirement for complex III assembly, which enzyme subunits are essential for this interaction, and whether the CBP3 and CBP4 proteins play a role in stabilizing assembled enzyme in vivo. Interactions between the CBP3 protein and complex III subunits will be determined. A possible role of the assembly proteins in insertion of the heme group into the cytochrome b subunit during the assembly process will be examined. The results of the proposed studies wiIl provide valuable insight into the assembly of complex III and into chaperone-assisted assembly of multisubunit complexes in general.  %%%  Assembly of protein complexes is a fundamental yet essential process for cell survival. Relatively little is known is known about the assembly processes, although in many cases it has been firmly established that chaperone proteins are essential components. The proposed research will  be invaluable towards defining the mechanism of action of two chaperones which are specific for the assembly of an enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The enzyme, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (or complex III), is an essential part of a biochemical pathway which is responsible for the synthesis of the majority of the energy utilized by the cell. Complex III is an ideal enzyme for assembly studies since it is remarkably well conserved in fungi, plants and animals.  Information gained on the mechanism of assembly of complex III in a lower, more easily manipulated organism, such as fungi, will likely be applicable to similar studies in higher organisms. Moreover, since complex III is a multisubunit enzyme whose subunits originate in two separate compartments of  the cell, information acquired through our investigations on the mechanism of assembly of this enzyme will be important towards better understanding intracellular communication.  ***      ??",
