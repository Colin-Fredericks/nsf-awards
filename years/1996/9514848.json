 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award is to support collaborative research by Dr. Terry Kammash, Department of Nuclear Engineering, and Dr. Phillip Roe, Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan and Dr. Necdat Aslan, Department of Physics at Marmara University in Istanbul, Turkey.  The thrust of the research is to produce a generalized computer code that solves the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in two dimensions on the structured or unstructured quadrilateral grids using a higher order Godunov type scheme.  The code is to be developed so that it will accept different initial and boundary conditions to model different physical problems of interest to plasma physics and controlled fusion as well as to astrophysical problems.  Scope: This award is to fund visits by the two U.S. P.I.'s, as well as one of their graduate students at the U. of Michigan, to Marmara University, and the visit of the Turkish scientist and a graduate student to the University of Michigan.  The project brings these very experienced scientists in the fields of MHD, fusion and computational fluid dynamics to collaborate on developing a new powerful two-dimensional computer code to solve MHD problems in various physical applications.  The project also allows for the initiation of a long-term collaboration between the two teams at the two schools in the United States and Turkey.   It also provides an international experience for a U.S. graduate student, by working at a dynamic foreign institute in Istanbul.  Partial funding of this project is being provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences.   The project fits well with the objectives of the Division of International Programs.",
