 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526944  Holm   Understanding the origin and tectonic setting of voluminous Middle Proterozoic (1.5-1.3 Ga) magmatism across the United States and Canada has long been one of the foremost problems in Precambrian geology.  Whereas early views largely considered emplacement of the magmatic belt in an overall extensional 'anorogenic' regime, recent structural work in a variety of areas in the western U.S. seems to favor a compressional or transpressional regime.   Because such evidence comes from widely scattered locations including central New Mexico, southern Nevada, Colorado, Arizona, and western South Dakota, the results have been interpreted as representing a regional deformation related to plate interactions in a compressional setting.  This interpretation, if correct, has new and important implications for the Proterozoic tectonothermal evolution of southern Lauretina and require further testing and re-evaluation of structures and thermal histories of Middle Proterozoic intrusions across the entire magmatic belt.   In order to test this interpretation, the PI will investigate the tectonic setting, depth of emplacement, and unroofing history of the Middle the PI will Proterozoic Wolf River batholith and associated plutons in Wisconsin.   He will carry out a detailed field, microstructural, and Ar/Ar thermochoronlogic investigation.  The field and microstructural work will assess whether the fabrics are synintrusive or postintrusive features and whether they are compressional or extensional in origin.  Detailed field studies mapping out fabric orientations and assessing kinematic indicators should help distinguish between local strains related to pluton emplacement, regional strain during intrusion, or post-intrusive solid-state strain.   The field and microstructural work will be complemented by an Ar/Ar thermochronlogic investigation of the plutonic complex and country rock.  Whereas Rb-Sr biotite age dating results from Wisconsin have provided us with a first-order picture of cooling and/or  reheating during much of the Proterozoic, the results are open to interpretation and important questions remain.  A detailed Ar/Ar study on several different mineral phases (hornblende, muscovite, and biotite) should help to assess the depth of emplacement of the Middle Proterozoic plutonic complex and to better determine the timing an d pattern of unroofing or cooling of the Proterozoic rocks in the region.",
