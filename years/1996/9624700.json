 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective computer architecture requires a carefully selected set of workloads  that are representative of the target design's software environment.  However,  it is becoming increasingly difficult for computer architects to obtain workloads  that accurately characterize today's complex software systems.  The Architect's  Workload Suite (AWS) project seeks to address this problem by developing a  collection of commercial, public domain, and next-generation software systems  that architects can use as a source of representative workloads.  Using on-chip  performance counters and custom tools, each workload in the  AWS will be  accompanied by  Workload Characterization Worksheet that summarizes its  architectural requirements including memory-system, branch-prediction,  instruction-level parallelism, course-grained parallelism, and operating system  support.  Workload summaries will allow researchers to carefully screen the AWS  workloads, selecting a set that is appropriate for their work.  In addition to  the workload suite, this work is developing several hardware/software analysis  tools.  The first, based on Trap-driven simulation, characterizes and evaluates  memory systems.  The second, a modified version of DECs ATOm analysis tool,  generates accurate software traces of the entire system's activity, including OS  and application workloads.  Together, the workloads, their characterization  worksheets and the tools will help architects determine how best to support  future software systems.",
