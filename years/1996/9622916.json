Work of the proposer   with J. Horvath describing isotropy groups of actions of GLn on   products of flag manifolds associated to tame quivers will be used   to study the occurrence of dense orbits in actions associated to   wild quivers.Instances of the First Fundamental Theorem of Invariant  Theory for some low dimensional reducible actions analyzable by means   of multiplicity-free actions will be investigated. A major goal  will be an investigation of certain rings important for understan-   ding tensor products and related questions. It has been proved in some   cases, and is suspected in others, that these rings may be free as   modules over certain natural polynomial subrings. The description of   nice bases for these free modules may provide insight into the   Littlewood-Richardson Rule and related formulas. As time permits,   investigations of the ordinary geometric import of geometric invariant   theory, and of the Plancherel Theorem of  p-adic groups via Hecke   algebras, may also be undertaken.      Expository Abstract: In mathematics, one is often interested in   objects which may be different, but may be equivalent for some   purposes. Thus, in elementary geometry there is the notion of   congruence: two triangles, or other figures, are congruent if one   may be moved so as to fit exactly over the other. In an industrial   context, congruence is the idea underlying interchangeable parts.   The idea of invariant theory is to provide numerical criteria for   two objects to be equivalent, with respect to whatever is the   relevant notion of equivalence. Thus, two triangles are congruent   exactly when the lengths of their sides are the same triple of   numbers. The numbers which may be used to determine whether or not   two objects are equivalent are called *invariants(it)*. Invariant   theory seeks to f ind invariants for geometric configurations. This   project seeks to apply invariant theory in new directions. It will  look for systems of invariants for some new classes of configurations,   and it will also attempt to find some new structure in some of the most   important systems of invariants. Symmetry will be heavily exploited,   and systems whose structure is very strongly determined  by symmetries will form the central objects of investigation.",
