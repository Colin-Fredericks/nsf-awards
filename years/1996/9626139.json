 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626139  Friedman    This award will provide partial support for two three-day  workshops to be   held at the Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications of the  University   of Minnesota in late January and early February, 1996,  respectively.  The   workshops will focus on the following topics:  (1) Microstructure  and Thin   Films and (2) \"Smart\" Sensing and Control of Thin Films.  The  first   workshop will concentrate on thin films.  Computational  approaches to   modeling thin films have generally focused either on the  atomistic scale or   on the continuum scale.  However, because of the drastically  different time   and length scales involved in these disparate models, they are  not currently   linked.  This limits the ability of either model to describe the  process   adequately for industrial materials manufacturing.  Increased  computational   power will not solve this problem because strategies for scaling  up or   scaling down from these models do not yet exist.  Although  computational   power might allow scaling up in size, more sophisticated  techniques must   be developed for dealing with time scale issues.  The workshop  will bring   together mathematicians working in materials science and  materials   scientists who use modeling and simulation in order to jointly  address the   micro-macro linkage needed to understand microstructure evolution  in thin   films.  A series of talks and discussions are expected to lead to  a set of   suggestions on how to develop models using multiscaling  techniques.  The   eventual goals in realizing these suggestions are:  (1)  high-fidelity   simulations of thin-film processes which link ab initio,  calculations to   continuum microstructure/property models, and (2) approaches to  extracting   physical non-empirical models from these full simulations that  are suitable   for real-time process control.  The second workshop will also  focus on thin   films, but from a different perspective.  Controllers operate at  the macro   level.  At this  level the models are at the continuum scale and  their   evolution is dictated by partial differential equations (PDE).   Solution   techniques for PDE require the most powerful computers currently   available.  Models at this level of detail are unsuitable for  real-time process   control.  The workshop will explore research ideas on  mathematical   approaches for extracting the dominant parameters from the full  model.    Understanding the micro-macro linkage will be essential for  success in   using feedback control.  A topic of special interest of the  second workshop   is \"smart\" sensors, that is, sensors that \"understand\" the  process models and   are able to determine process parameters either directly or  indirectly using   these models.  It will emphasize algorithms which allow sensors  to infer   parameters of interest from other parameters for cases where one  cannot   directly sense a parameter that the physicochemical models  indicates is   critical to the control of the process.",
