 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on algorithms that work with limited  information.  This research investigates on-line algorithms in  the context of various resource allocation problems in operating  systems.  This project is taking a twofold approach to each  problem.  The first approach is to perform a theoretical study  using competitive analysis.  The competitive measure is used to  evaluate on-line algorithms by measuring their performance in  relation to the optimal off-line algorithm which has available to  it complete information about the problem instance at hand. This  effort plans to perform empirical tests to evaluate the  performance of various on-line algorithms in a realistic setting.    The first two problems addressed in this project are related to  memory management.  The first of these addresses ways in which  information about the access pattern of a program available at  compile time can be used to guide page replacement and  prefetching policies.  The investigator will develop methods  which can take a program and automatically generate appropriate  memory management instructions to be inserted in the code.  The  second problem addresses allocating memory resources among users  in a multiprocessing environment.  This work addresses this  problem for general multiprocessing environments as well as  methods specifically designed for database systems.  The third  problem examines preemptive load balancing strategies over local  area networks under a probabilistic model for process duration.  The last problem is an investigation of disk scheduling  strategies.  This work is motivated by the fact that the  availability of larger cheap memory has made it possible to have  long queues of disk updates which means that more sophisticated  scheduling policies can have a greater impact on disk  utilization.  ***",
