 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9626762  Ruppert    The research is on nonparametric estimation of conditional  expectations, conditional variances, and conditional densities, i.e.,  estimation without assuming that these functions belong to a  parametric family.  The work uses local regression, a particularly  simple and effective nonparametric method, where one fits parametric  models locally at each point in the domain of the function in order to  estimate the function at that point.  By varying the point one achieves  a globally nonparametric estimator.  The degree of  \"localness\" is  achieved by a bandwidth or smoothing parameter.  The work includes (a)  multivariate local polynomial regression where the local neighborhoods  are determined by a symmetric, positive definite bandwidth matrix that  must be estimated; (b) non-polynomial local models for estimating  functions with poles, jump discontinuities, or discontinuous  derivatives; and (c) semiparametric estimation of correlation functions  and other functions of scientific interest by local fitting of  estimating equations.  %%%  Present applications of this research on nonparametric estimation are  mostly in engineering but include nutrition.  These applications  include density-estimation radiosity in computer graphics, analysis of  simulation data from the pdf method of modeling turbulence, estimating  volatilities in financial engineering, combining local regression  smoothing and kriging for spatial data analysis, and modeling the  correlation between nutrient uptake as measured by both food frequency  questionnaires and more accurate, but also more expensive, food records.  In the strategic area of environmental science, this work has been  applied to two very different methods of monitoring air pollution,  LIDAR and biomonitoring.  ***",
