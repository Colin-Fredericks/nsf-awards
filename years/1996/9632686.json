 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632686  Davis    In this project, the PI will oversee the organization of  a workshop to address the future of climate-related  physical oceanographic research.  The ocean's role in  climate has been a central theme in the World  Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and is expected to be  a crucial ingredient of a major international effort to  study Climate Variability (CLIVAR).  To date, planning for  CLIVAR has been complex and multi-disciplinary, with three  manageable subprograms emerging, focusing, respectively,  on seasonal to interannual time scales, decadal to  centennial time scales, and anthropogenic climate change.  This workshop will complement the separate-timescale,  multidisciplinary international planning with an  oceanographic program, Ocean CLIVAR, that spans all three  components.  The objectives are to engage a  broad segment of the community to identify the key  oceanographic questions that need to be answered to  meet the objectives of the multi-disciplinary science plan  for CLIVAR, and to develop an implementation  plan to answer these questions.  A single workshop, with  three subgroups focused on sustained observations,  modeling, and process studies will be convened. A report  will be produced for community comment and to provide  input for a U.S. contribution to the international CLIVAR  workshops, the first of which is scheduled for September,  1996.  After completion of the international planning  effort, an implementation plan for Ocean CLIVAR will be  developed. ***",
