 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531721  Ramesh       The PI proposes an integrated solution to the problem of  dispatching electric power in the most economical manner while  meeting security and environmental constraints, where the term  security refers to the ability of the power network to sustain  normal operations in the event of contingencies.  This problem,  which is referred to in the proposal as the SECOPE problem, is an  extension of the On-line Optimal Power Flow problem.  The primary  objectives of the research are: 1) to find a decomposition for  the SECOPE problem that explicitly models the uncertainties in  the input data, and that filters and prioritizes suggested  control actions; 2) to determine an appropriate global  optimization technique for solving the above decomposition with  the addition of discrete control actions; and, 3) to study the  convergence characteristics of the synchronous and asynchronous  parallel implementations of this decomposition for realistic  power systems.  The primary objectives of the proposed education  activities are: 1) to use the multimedia resources of the  Internet and the World Wide Web to teach students to \"learn to  learn\",  2) to motivate students (especially undergraduates) to  pursue a career in power engineering.   ***",
