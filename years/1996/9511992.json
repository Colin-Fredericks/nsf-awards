 "awd_abstract_narration": "9511992  Jackiw    This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Roman Jackiw,    Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to  pursue with Dr. Q-Han Park, Department of Physics, Kyung Hee  University, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative  research to investigate various questions in field theory and  gravity.  Dr. Choonkyu Lee, Department of Physics, Seoul National  University, will serve in an advisory capacity with Dr. Park so  as to facilitate Dr. Park's entry into collaborative research  with the U.S. scientist.  This research will be centered on three  major topics: (1) properties of effective field theories for  high-temperature and high mass quantum chromodynamics (QCD) as  well as gravity; (2) low-dimensional field theory including  gravity; and (3) the study of integrable models and soliton  physics.    The collaborators expect to make significant progress in  understanding physical/mathematical properties of field theory  and gravity and in finding possible applications to various areas  of physics.  Benefit for the U.S. side will result from access to  well-trained Korean scientists, familiar with the topic, who are  eager to engage in the research and its computations.  The Korean  scientist will benefit from contact with a senior U.S. researcher  who, in addition to collaborating on this project, can provide an  overview of current research in this field and can provide  suggestions for the direction of further Korean research in field  theory and gravity.  This project is relevant to the objectives  of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to  increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean  scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific  information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Dr. Park's  participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
