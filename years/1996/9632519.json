 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the   Chemistry Division, Reisler will examine fundamental state-to-state   processes in unimolecular and bimolecular interactions, particularly   systems undergoing unimolecular decomposition.  The ultimate goal is to   understand how to manipulate and direct chemical reactivity.  The   decomposition of the prototype molecule HNCO will be examined using   sequential excitation and imaging techniques.  When dissociation is too   rapid to compete effectively with internal vibrational energy   redistribution (IVR), signatures in NCO, NH, and CO product state   distributions (PSDs) will reveal the presence of dynamical biases.    Experiments are also proposed which are aimed at inducing selectivity and   examining control of reactivity by several kinds of potential energy   surfaces (PESs).  Collisional studies will be extended to systems that   involve two pathways, especially where spin-forbidden pathways are   induced by collisions.  Several sophisticated experimental techniques   will be used, such as multiple resonance excitation and crossed pulsed   molecular beams.  Theoretical work will continue with Prof. Reinhard   Schinke from Goettingen.   In this project Prof. Reisler will study the influence of the stretching   and bending motions of a molecule on the final outcome of the   light-initiated dissociation of the molecule into fragments.  The issues   explored in this study include the identity of products formed and the   final distribution of the various forms of internal energy into the   fragment particles.  Such fundamental examinations of the dynamics of   chemical bond breaking have applications in many areas, such as an   understanding of atmospheric chemistry and combustion processes.",
