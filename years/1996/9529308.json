 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of African-American migration in the United States.  This project will investigate the family patterns of migrants from southern states who made their way to northern cities during the first half of the 20th Century.  Special attention will be devoted to the following five dimensions of family life: (1) the marital status of males and females, (2) the living arrangements of currently married males and females, (3) family headship by adult women with children, (4) parenthood among never married adult women, and (5) the living situations of young children, especially the presence or absence of parents.  The project will rely upon public use samples constructed from historical U.S. censuses to conduct this exploration.  Specifically, northern residents of large urban areas will be extracted from the 1920, 1940, and 1960 public use samples.  These residents will then be classified according to their migration histories.  A comparative approach will be used to determine to what extent the family patterns of migrants from the South differ from long-time residents of the North.  To the extent possible, migrants will also be compared with the sedentary southern population.  Parallel analyses will be conducted for whites and African Americans, employing multivariate, \"regression family\" techniques such as logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, and weighted least squares regression.   %%%   This historical study will help us understand contemporary America and its social problems.  Recently, the family patterns of inner-city African Americans have received considerable attention from social scientists and social commentators.  Many of the contemporary social problems of inner-city populations have been attributed to the \"disintegrating\" urban family.  Some authors have attributed the relatively high incidence of unstable marriages and single-parent households among inner-city residents to the transplantation of a southern \"sharecropping culture\" to northern cities -- a proc ess made possible by the massive South-to-North migration before 1960.  Yet, very little empirical evidence has been marshaled to describe thoroughly, much less explain, the family patterns of southern migrants.  To do so successfully will contribute significantly to our understanding of the etiology of modern family patterns in inner-cities, particularly among African Americans",
