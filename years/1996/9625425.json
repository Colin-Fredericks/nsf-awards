 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to intestigate the celebrated Hirsch  conjecture using the new theoretical framework that was developed  recently by the investigator and collaborators for resolving  the conjecture.  In contrast to all of the previous attacks on  the conjecture which were inherently combinatorial, the new  strategy brings to bear on the conjecture the powerful machinery  of continuous analysis and representation theory of continuous  groups.  Preliminary results from the new approach include (i)  the discovery of a new formulation of the Hirsch conjecture with  connections to Gaussian elimination, and (ii) the emergence of  the most compelling theoretical and empirical evidence to  date about the validity of not just the Hirsch conjecture but a  considerably stronger version of it.    The project aims at proving the strong Hirsch conjecture by  employing powerful techniques from differential geometry and  cohomology theory.  The strong Hirsch conjecture, if proved,  would show the existence of exponentially many paths of linear  length between the initial and optimal vertices of a polyhedron,  and would hence revitalize the research for polynomial-time  Simplex algorithms.  ***",
