 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625451  Schlick  This proposal is directed to the study of self-assembling of  perfluorinated and protiated ionomers in the bulk and in  solution, as a function of the solvent, the ion content, and  the degree of neutralization.  The following experiments are  planned.  (a)  F-NMR spectra of perfluorinated ionomers as a  function of concentration will be measured in ethanol,  water, formamide and N-methyl formamide, solvents that span  a range of dielectric constants from 24 to 182.  The  lineshapes will be analyzed and compared with results for  perfluorinated polymers and short-chain perfluorinated  surfactants, to deduce the smallest unit that exists at low  concentrations, and the degree of aggregation.  (b)  The  diffusion coefficients of neutral, cationic and anionic  tracers in perfluorinated ionomers will be measured by ESR  imaging and correlated with the degree and type of self-  assembling of the polymer chains.  (c)  In an attempt to  understand the contribution of the backbone to self-  assembling, poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) (EMAA)  ionomers in solution, and in the dry and solvent-swollen  state, will be studied by the spin probe ESR method and ESR  imaging as a function of the concentration of the ionic  monomer (MAA), to deduce the dynamics of the aggregates and  the curvature of the polymer-solvent interface.  (d)  ESR  imaging will be further developed in three main areas.  The  time required for data acquisition will be reduced by a  Fourier transform method for image reconstruction so as to  increase the range of diffusion coefficients that can be  deduced; the hardware and software necessary for 2D spatial-  spatial imaging will be assembled; and novel spin probes  designed to enhance the spatial resolution will be prepared.  %%%  The methods proposed for the study of, and collection of  data on, self-assembled ionomer systems are considered  important for the study of transport processes in drug  delivery systems; in ocular and intraocular lenses; in  preparation of  new materials, including catalysts; and in  biological systems that involve transport through cell  membranes.  ***",
