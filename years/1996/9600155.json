 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will  focus on the recently discovered top quark and on the `Higgs`  particle predicted to exist as part of the mechanism which may  explain the origin of mass.  Analyses will be done which will  make it possible to determine the properties of the top quark  (especially its mass) from experimental studies despite the  complex relation between these properties and the experimental  observations.  Analyses facilitating the determination of the  properties of the Higgs particle from future experiments will be  done as well.  Learning the properties of the top quark and of  the Higgs particle is centrally important to our learning more  about the nature of the elementary particles and their  interactions, and about the origin of mass.       The project will also have an educational component in which  an effort will be made to make physics more accessible to  introductory students.  An effort will also be made to increase  the participation of women in physics by providing teaching  internships for undergraduate women, and by the principal  investigator serving as a role model for women.",
