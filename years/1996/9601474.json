 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is widely recognized that people are strongly motivated to maintain a positive conception of themselves and a consistent, meaningful conception of the world in which they live.  Until recently, however, little attention has been paid to the question of why these very basic human motives exist.  The current research is focused on a theoretical explanation for these motives.  The theory (Terror Management Theory) suggests that self-esteem and cultural worldviews serve the psychological function of protecting people from the terror they feel when they contemplate or become aware of their own inevitable death.  For this reason, it is proposed that people invest a significant amount of effort in maintaining faith in their own worldviews and belief in their own self-worth.  Accumulating experimental research, conducted in four different countries, provides support for this analysis.  The goal during the current funding period is to extend Terror Management Theory to better understand its domain of application, and to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying psychological processes that produce the documented effects.  A broad range of experimental methods will be used to examine such behaviors as stereotyping, helping, and efforts to persuade others.",
