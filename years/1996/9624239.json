 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the uses of randomization, with  particular emphasis on graph algorithms.  In particular,  the problems to be ``tackled''(but not necessarily exactly  solved) by the PI's randomized graphical optimization  techniques include: (1) The maximum flow and minimum cut  problems can be solved exactly, with the major objective  being the design of faster, simpler and more practical  algorithms for arriving at a correct answer; (2) Graph  coloring and bisection, analysis of network reliability,  and construction of low-cost high-connectivity networks,  are extremely hard to solve exactly, with the major  objective being to find efficient algorithms that give  answers as close as possible to the elusive optimum.  Implementation and testing of the algorithmic solutions is  an integrated component of this project.  The Integrated  Educational Plan of this CAREER Grant includes the  teaching, improvement and development of theoretical  computer science courses, including: (1) Undergraduate  algorithms course; (2) Undergraduate discrete mathematics  course; (3) Graduate randomized algorithms course; (4)  Undergraduate information retrieval and text databases.",
