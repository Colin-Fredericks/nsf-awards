 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate Fiber Optics and Communications for Engineering  Technology is designed to introduce 30 faculty members from  community and undergraduate colleges to this expanding technology.   Two one-week seminars/workshops are planned for June 1996.  The  program is a collaborative effort involving three community  colleges in the Boston, MA area and one four-year technical  college.  During the first week, 15 faculty will be offered 40  hours of training, half of which will be in the fiber optic  laboratory at Wentworth Institute of Technology, and the remaining  20 hours will consist of lectures, simulation and analysis using  computers.  Involvement by industry is integral to the program.   The laboratory exercises allow participants to handle optical  fibers and a number of specialized instrumentation and test  equipment developed specifically for fiber optics.  The basics,  uses, and applications of fiber optics will be emphasized,  especially as they relate to engineering technology education at  the two- and four-year level.  In the selection process, women,  minorities and those faculty who intend to introduce/enhance fiber  optic instruction at their home institutions will receive priority.   No prior knowledge of fiber optics or communications technology is  required.  A follow-up one-week session is proposed for the summer  of 1997.",
