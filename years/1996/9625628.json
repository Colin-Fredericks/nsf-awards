 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project,  supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program as a  Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)  activity, combines intellectual and physical resources of San  Jose State University (SJSU) and the IBM Almaden Research Center  (IBM/ARC) to offer undergraduate students, graduate students, and  high school chemistry teachers an integrated research and  education program that focusses on the analytical and surface  chemistry of materials.  During the tenure of this thirty-six  month standard grant, Professors Pesek and Scharberg and nine of  their SJSU colleagues in the Departments of Chemistry, Physics,  and Materials Engineering will join with twenty-two of their  counterparts at IBM/ARC to jointly mentor a total of twenty-two  undergraduates, graduate students, small college faculty, and  high school chemistry teachers as they pursue fundamental and  applied research projects in materials chemistry.  Each of the  participants will spend time working in laboratories both at SJSU  and IBM/ARC, thereby enabling them to gain a perspective on  academic as well as industrial research, and how industrial-  academic cooperation can benefit the two organizations.  This academic-industrial integrated research and education  program builds upon the pioneering work of these organizations  that was supported under NSF grant CHE-9300131.  Participants in  this cooperative research activity will gain an enhanced  appreciation of basic and applied scientific research which  should encourage the students to pursue more advanced degrees,  the small college faculty to initiate or more actively pursue  projects at their home institutions and thereby share the  excitement of research and discovery with their students, and the  high school teachers to motivate more of their own students to  consider science as a career.",
