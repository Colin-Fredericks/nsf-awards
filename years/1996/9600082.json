 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support Rotafest, a conference in honor of  the 64th birthday of Gian-Carlo Rota. The conference will be held  at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on April 17--20, 1996.  The subject of the talks is not being restricted other than  that  they be connected to the work of Professor Rota. It is  expected  that most of the talks will be in combinatorics or algebraic  combinatorics. The main object of the conference is to provide a  perspective on the multitude of work that has taken place in  these areas in the past thirty years and to provide impetus for  further work.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods  to study how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The  behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern  communications. For example, the design of large networks, such  as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of  algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of  objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. In  addition, the type of enumerative information being sought in  this project has been of use in the design of geometric  algorithms for problems in robotics and motion planning.",
