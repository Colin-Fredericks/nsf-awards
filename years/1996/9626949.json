 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626949  Davidson    The Museum of Science in Boston will develop an exhibit and other  interactive activities \"Messages\".  This is about communication.   The focus of the visitor's experience will be exploring the many  facets of human and animal communication including linguistics,  psychology, sociology, sociobiology, cybernetics, information  theory, and telecommunications.  The activities will improve  visitors general science literacy by helping them understand the  nature of communication both as a subject that encompasses many  scientific disciplines and as a scientific thinking skill.  Three  themes will be developed 1) Communication is an integral part of  being alive; 2) The modes and media of community are many; and 3)  Communication requires a sender and a receiver.  In addition to the  1200 sq. ft. core exhibit, the museum will develop related kiosks  that will be placed at various locations throughout the museum,  public programs, and Internet-based activities.  It will be  designed for universal accessibility and is intended for a diverse  audience with special attention to youngsters and people with few  technological skills.  Materials developed for teachers and  students will address the Communication basic technology area  recommended in Science For All Americans.  Special emphasis will be  placed on linking the content and formal educational and take-home  materials with Project PALMS, the NSF State Systemic Initiative in  Massachusetts.",
