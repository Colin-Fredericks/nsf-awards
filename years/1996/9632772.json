 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project incorporates a one and one-half day Graduate School  Application and Process Workshop into the National Conference of  the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in  Science (SACNAS).  This project is tied to the goals of the  Society, one of which is to increase the number of Chicano,  Latino and Native American students pursuing advanced degrees in  science, mathematics, and engineering fields.  This new dimension  to the National SACNAS Conference will directly impact the  entrance of Chicano, Latino and Native American students into  graduate programs in science, mathematics, and engineering  fields.    The Goal of the Program: To increase the number of Chicano,  Latino and Native American students gaining entrance to graduate  programs.  Faculty and graduate student advisors will assist  undergraduate students in developing a well written statement of  purpose leading to a complete graduate school application.  The  hope is that every senior student who attends this workshop to  leaving having completed both a graduate school application and a  funding agency application.    The Rationale for Pursuing this New Direction: A significant  number of students who attend SACNAS conferences and others who  could be attracted to these conferences are not aggressive in  pursuing graduate opportunities.  Some simply never apply to  graduate schools while others who may apply, but are denied  admission, choose to give up on seeking admission to a graduate  program.    Program Format: The workshop will contain workshops, panel  discussions, scientific symposia, small group discussions and  faculty advising sessions.  Funding agency representatives and  graduate program recruiters will be on hand to discuss  opportunities with the students and will be available to provide  information on their respective institution's programs.  All of  the workshop's programs, discussions, and social sessions are  deigned to encourage a national support network of people  interested in en couraging Chicano, Latino and Native American  students to have a greater participation in science, mathematics,  and engineering fields.  This workshop will bring together a  group of highly talented undergraduates and offer them the  personal attention and advice necessary to complete an excellent  graduate school application.",
