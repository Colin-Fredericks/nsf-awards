 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project under the direction of Chemistry Professor James A. Holcombe   of the University of Texas, Austin, is supported by the Analytical and   Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry.  The research   concerns the introduction of solid samples and microsamples into the   inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS).  Electrothermal   vaporization (ETV) will be developed as the method of sample   introduction.  A set of fundamental studies will be done to provide an   understanding of how material is transported to the ICP and the   parameters influencing the process.  Included in the work are studies of   the influence of carrier particle size on the efficiency of analyte   transport and the impact on transport of the nature of the type of   association of analyte with carrier.  A second aspect of the sample   transportation investigations will be concerned with development of   externally generated carriers.  Two of the methods to be explored for   this purpose are the pyrolysis of benzene to form carbon particles, and   the reaction of gaseous titanium tetrachloride with water vapor to form   titanium dioxide particles.  An entirely different approach will involve   the use of desolvated nebulizer-generated aerosols produced from   aspiration of selected salts.  Another method to generate carbon   particles will involve oxygen ashing in the presence of palladium.    Finally, to correct for space charge effects on analyte transport,   automatic lens correction procedures will be explored to provide a   dynamic correction technique for the transient signal produced by   ETV-ICP-MS.  Instruments for chemical analysis necessarily must have a means of   introducing the sample to be analyzed into the instrument.  In some   cases, this requires a change in the physical state of the species of   interest, for example, from a liquid to a gas.  Often, not all of the   sample enters the measurement zone of the instrument and therefore the   efficiency of transport of sample is of great interest.  This project is   concerned with this problem as it is encountered with  the inductively   coupled plasma-mass spectrometer.",
