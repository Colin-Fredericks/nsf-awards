 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new research program in theoretical gravitational physics  will be undertaken by Prof. Anderson.  He will address three  important issues relating to the study of black holes.  These are the questions:  What is the end point of the black  hole evaporation process?  What happens to the information  about how a black hole formed?  How do quantum fields alter  the thermodynamic properties of a black hole?  The  investigations will center around the ways in which quantum  fields alter the spacetime geometry both inside and outside  of a black hole.  These alterations affect the thermodynamic  properties of the black hole.  They also have a strong  influence on what is left after the black hole finishes  evaporating.  What happens to the information about how a  black hole formed may depend on both the spacetime geometry  inside its event horizon and what is left after the black  hole finishes evaporating.  Another proposed investigation  is the development of a practical way to make computations  in quantum field theory when the mode equation for free  quantized fields is not completely separable.    The results should significantly enhance our ability to  study the details of processes such as black hole  evaporation, the decay of a strong electric field due to  particle production, and particle production due to heavy  ion collisions in nuclear physics.",
