 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry and Physics Departments are increasing their efforts to strengthen undergraduate degree programs in the sciences. This effort includes the construction of a microscope-based Raman system. The benefit of constructing such a system, rather than purchasing it as a commercial unit, is not only to obtain a Raman spectrometer, but also to gain a better understanding of laser techniques. Raman experiments yield information about the vibrational and rotational nature of molecules. These data are useful when performing structural and chemical analyses. Raman complements infra-red (IR) absorption spectroscopy because weak IR absorbers are strong Raman scatterers and vice versa. The open optical cavity, exposed components, and adjustability of laser optics in this system afford the student a valuable opportunity to investigate the workings of a simple laser. As any person who works with lasers will testify, hands-on experience with a laser is absolutely essential to comprehending its operation.    The primary goals of the project are to train undergraduate chemistry and physics students in the use and application of a microscope-based Raman system; to develop new laboratory exercises for several courses, including Organic Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, Physical Chemistry, Optics, and Biophysics; and to extend the breadth of investigative possibilities for undergraduate student/faculty research.",
