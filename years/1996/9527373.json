This record, which is present both in  areas of bare blue ice, as well as in deep ice cores,  consists  of a combination of local eruptions, as well as eruptions from  more distant volcanic sources from which glassy shards can be  chemically fingerprinted and related to a source volcano.  Field  work carried out during the 1994/1995 Antarctic field season in  the Allan Hills area of Antarctica, and subsequent microbeam  chemical analysis and 40Ar/39Ar dating has shown that tephra  layers in deep Antarctic ice preserve a coherent, systematic  stratigraphy, and can be successfully mapped, dated, chemically  fingerprinted and tied to source volcanoes.  The combination of  chemical fingerprinting of glass shards, and chemical analysis of  volcanic aerosols associated with ash layers will allow  establishment of a high-resolution chronology of local and  distant volcanism that can help understand patterns of  significant explosive volcanisms and atmospheric loading and  climactic effects associated with volcanic eruptions.  Correlation of individual tephra layers, or sets of layers, in  blue ice areas, which have been identified in many places the  Transantarctic Mountains, will allow the geometry of ice flow in  these areas to be better understood and will provide a useful  basis for interpreting ice core records.",
