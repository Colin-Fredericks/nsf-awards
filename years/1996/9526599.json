This award is  part of a project which involves a three year coordinated  geophysical and geological study of mid-Mesozoic to mid-Cenozoic  continental growth by accretion.  The goal is to develop a four  dimensional (X,Y,Z,and time) understanding of accretionary  processes along the portion of the northwestern margin of North  America underlain by the Coast Mountains orogen, British Columbia  and southeastern Alaska.  Specifically, the project involves a  transect of the orogen close to the British Columbia-Alaska border.   A geophysical pilot project along this transect in the summer of  1994 resulted in over 1700 km of new marine MCS (Multi-Channel  Seismic), gravity and magnetic data, and common receiver gathers  from 60 REFTEK seismometers.  Building on the high quality of this  geophysical data base, the Principal Investigators propose a group  of studies designed to construct  a 400 km cross section of the  orogen through the entire crust and into the upper mantle.  To  accomplish this, they must resolve fundamental questions regarding  how continental crust is formed during terrane accretion.  ***",
