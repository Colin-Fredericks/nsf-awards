 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vastly improved Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and low cost of Pentium processors are revolutionizing methods of research and analysis of data that are geographically distributed. New GIS/GPS technology and software products are ideally suited for the study of environmental science and related disciplines, yet most two- and four-year colleges are ill-prepared to adapt their current curriculum to use this valuable tool. Holyoke Community College (HCC) believes that a strategic investment in this keystone technology will have a long-term payoff in a broad range applications in many disciplines and will result in better prepared transfer and career graduates. This project has two major foci: 1) enhancement of the Environmental Science curriculum through the use of GIS/GPS, including the creation of a new major devoted solely to GIS/GPS; and 2) enrichment of teaching and learning of science in area secondary schools through the use of HCC as a GIS/GPS technology transfer station via collaborative relationships with Salem State College. This project will create a 10 station Pentium GIS/GPS lab. Classroom and laboratory learning at the college and area high schools will be enhanced by hands-on, discovery-based learning, especially important for nontraditional learners, particularly students for whom English is a second language. A formative and summative evaluation process will be used over the two-year life of the project. Modifications will be made based upon feedback from pilot testing of new GIS/GPS classroom and lab modules and ongoing input and evaluation from a project advisory committee comprised of local and national experts from two- and four-year institutions and private industry. Final products developed and experience gained will be shared with other educational institutions through HCC's home page on Internet and published in appropriate GIS journals.",
