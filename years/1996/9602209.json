 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602209  Austin  This study examines informal strategies of maintaining social order in ethnically complex (Muslim-Christian) Philippine municipalities in the province of Lanao del Norte on the southern island of Mindanao Although international attention has focused on the unstable nature of Muslin-Christian regions around the world, few researchers have addressed the distinct peacekeeping networks which appear to have at least relative success even in ethnically diverse Philippine communities.  The P.I. will analyze the variety of Muslim-Christian disputes and grievances in the region and will clarify the varied peace-making styles which have emerged at the neighborhood and village levels Particular focus will be given to the manner in which citizen volunteers have mobilized in an effort to maintain peace and order even in the comparative absence of official police and government social control agencies. Special attention will be paid to the role played by the intermediary (bilingual fixer) who is traditionally sought out to intervene between rival Muslim--Christian groups. Data for the project will come from in-depth interviews with community leaders (priests, Islamic dates, village captains, police and court officials and educators, among others.  Analyzing the non-violent, peacemaking mechanisms appearing in the Muslim--Christian communities and the social context in which they succeed or fail will provide valuable information to researchers and policy makers in other world areas experiencing political-religious discord.  %%%%",
