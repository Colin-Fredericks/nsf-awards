 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this work is to develop a real-time leaf thickness  sensor and test it in the field. The sensor will be based on strain  gauges and will be small enough to rest on a leaf.  The sensor will be constructed from strain gauges attached to a strip  of material that is flexed via attachments to a leaf. Materials  (crystal, glass, or metal) for the sensor will be tested in the  laboratory for sensitivity and thermal effects. Field experiments will  be done to document the sensor's ability to measure leaf thickness in  response to diurnal variation in hydration state.  The significance of the research will be the development of a leaf  thickness sensor for use under field conditions. This will be a new  sensor that will yield new knowledge. It will find use as an indicator  of plant water status. In addition it will be a sensor to document leaf  development dynamics and the effect of stressors on leaf status. It  will find application in agriculture as a sensor for automated control  of growth conditions. Finally, it will find general use where variation  in the thickness of thin sheets needs to be measured continuously.",
