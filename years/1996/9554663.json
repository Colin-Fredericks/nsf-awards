 "awd_abstract_narration": "Faculty at the University of Southern Mississippi will conduct a  series of workshops with mathematics faculty from two-year colleges  who teach pre-service teachers. Coordination between faculty at  two- and four-year institutions is critical, as an increasing  number of students in pre-service teacher preparation programs at  the university level transfer from two-year schools. The workshops  will provide access to experiences with current approaches to  mathematics content and pedagogical activities called for by the  NCTM Standards. This project will provide participants with the  material and support necessary to successfully incorporate the  workshop topics into their present curricula, and to develop the  capability of all participants to serve as leaders in their home  institutions. Furthermore, participants will share their approaches  to incorporating project topics into the curricula through  publications and presentations at professional meetings.",
