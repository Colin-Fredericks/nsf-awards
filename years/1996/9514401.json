The specific goals of the project are: (1) A  grammar and dictionary of Mina; (2) A grammar and dictionary of  Gidar; (3) A syntax of Lele; and (4) A syntax of East Dangla. The  study is also theoretical in that it will address the  interrelationships between word order, coding on the verb, object  incorporation, and coding through adpositions, all of which are  deployed by languages under study.  A native speaker of East  Dangla, a person with some linguistic training, will be brought  from Chad to participate in the project.      The Chadic branch is the largest family within the Afroasiatic  phylum, which includes such well studied languages as Egyptian  and Semitic. Chadic languages are spoken in Nigeria, Northern  Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. Many of these languages are also  endangered. They are spoken by a small number of people in a  region undergoing rapid urbanization with Hausa, Arabic, and Fula  as vehicular languages of the area. The languages chosen for  description belong to Central and Eastern branches of Chadic.  They differ in very important respects in their syntax,  morphology, and phonology. The proposed descriptions will fill  important gaps in our knowledge of the Chadic language family.",
