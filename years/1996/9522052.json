 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationships between populations of a species, and between closely related species, have  often been estimated through the analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).  This study will test  a key assumption on which conclusions from past mitochondrial DNA  based phylogenies have  rested.  The assumption is that the amount of mtDNA variation across an entire species is  negligible.  This assumption is critical to the reconstruction of phylogenies and the interpretation  of evolutionary histories, especially those of primates.  Contrary to this assumption, within the  female philopatric macaques, significant mtDNA variation exists within the same species.   Unlike macaques, leaf monkeys exhibit female dispersal.  Additionally, there are species within  each genus that have similar geographic distributions.  Through mtDNA analysis of two such  species in each genus, we propose to: (1) examine the effects of female dispersal on distributions  of mtDNA diversity (geography held constant); (2) assess the effects of geographic distribution  on mitochondrial genetic structure within each genus (female dispersal held constant); and (3)  determine whether the 'macaque' model of mtDNA population structure can be broadly applied  to other higher primates.   Hence, a mtDNA analysis of selected macaque and leaf monkey  species pairs provides a naturally controlled situation in which to examine the effects of female  dispersal on population structure based on maternally inherited mtDNA.  This study uniquely  examines the relationship between social organization and the dynamics of mtDNA evolution in  higher primates.  The information obtained will be crucial to recognizing limitations of mtDNA  analysis for inferring primate phylogenies and evolutionary histories.",
