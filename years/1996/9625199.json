 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Faculty Early Career project.  The project will study gas phase   protein folding and structure.  The solution tertiary/quaternary   structure of proteins is crucial to their activity.  Gas phase proteins   are solvent-free, and are structurally defined only by their   intramolecular constraints.  Gas phase work thus provides a background   for understanding folding and structure in solution, and the present   project will elucidate the roles that intramolecular and solvent   interactions play in establishing protein structure in solution.  This   work will use ion chromatography, a new technique for separating isomers   in the gas phase, combined with electrospray mass spectrometry.  The   technique will provide overall shape information about the proteins   studied.  Educationally, Dr. Clemmer will teach oral communication skills   to graduate students by development of a student-run bioanalytical   chemistry seminar series and will mentor minority students regularly.  This project will study protein structure in the simplest of situations,   the gas phase, and will use the information gained thereby to understand   the factors governing their solution structures.  The project will teach   effective oral communication to graduate students and Dr. Clemmer will   mentor minority students regularly in his research group.",
