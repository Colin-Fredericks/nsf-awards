 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9521721    This is a study of the feasibility of using fully densified (nonporous) ion-conducting perovskites as catalytic membranes in membrane reactors for the oxidative coupling of  methane.  It is a collaborative effort between Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, who prepares and characterizes the membranes, and Washington State University, which performs the reactor studies.  Two membranes will be studied, one a lanthanum-strontium-cobalt-iron-oxygen system, the other a lanthanum-barium-cobalt-iron-oxygen system.  Measurements of oxygen permeation and catalytic selectivity are done at elevated pressures.  Dynamic X-ray diffraction is used to monitor the stability of the membrane.    Oxidative coupling of methane is a process that converts natural gas to a valuable chemical feedstock in a single step.  Despite its obvious attractiveness, a cost-effective technology using this approach has been elusive.  This project combines advances in catalytic science, reactor design, and new materials to this problem.  ***",
