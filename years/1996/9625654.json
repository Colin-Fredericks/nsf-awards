 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625654  Gompf       This project deals with the interplay between symplectic and   contact geometry and low-dimensional topology.  A main focus of the  investigation is on the topology of Stein surfaces, or complex affine  varieties that are also smooth 4-manifolds.  These are automatically  Kaehler, hence symplectic, and when their topology is finite, they  have natural boundaries that are contact 3-manifolds.  The principal  investigator is studying Stein surfaces by means of their handle  decompositions, addressing questions such as the following:  Which  3-manifolds arise as boundaries of Stein surfaces, i.e., which  3-manifolds admit holomorphically fillable contact structures?  Which  homotopy classes of 2-plane fields on a given 3-manifold can be  realized in this manner?  How many Stein surfaces can have a given  3-manifold as boundary?  Through the known connections between  symplectic and 4-manifold topology (such as Seiberg-Witten theory),  this should relate to the classification problem for smooth  4-manifolds as well as to other problems, such as the slice genus of  classical knots.       One of the cornerstones of modern mathematics and physics is the  notion of a \"manifold,\" that is, a space that looks locally like  ordinary Euclidean space.  Curves are 1-dimensional manifolds, and  surfaces are 2-dimensional.  The space in which we live is  3-dimensional, and the universe, space-time, is an example of a  4-manifold.  A basic question of topology is what shapes such spaces  can have.  Ironically, the familiar dimensions 3 and 4 are by far the  least understood -- even less understood than dimensions 5 and higher,  where there is more \"room\" in which to work.  Almost nothing was  known about the shapes of 4-manifolds until 15 years ago, when the  revolutionary breakthroughs of Freedman and Donaldson led to an  explosive growth in knowledge and techniques.  In the last few years,  it has become apparent that topology in low dimensions (i.e., 3 and 4)  is intimately linked to sympl ectic and contact geometry.  These  latter fields emerged from classsical physics (Hamiltonian  mechanics), and in recent years they have become rapidly developing  independent subjects with connections to various other areas of  mathematics (for example, algebraic geometry).  The principal  investigator has been studying 4-manifolds since the initial  breakthroughs in the field, and he is now examining the connections  between low-dimensional topology and symplectic and contact geometry.  Using topological techniques, he recently expanded the scope of  symplectic geometry by showing that symplectic structures are much  more common than originally believed.  He is currently producing new  examples of contact structures, and new tools for analyzing them.  He  anticipates that continued investigation of the interplay between  these three areas should lead to further insight into all three.  ***",
