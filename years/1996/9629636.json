 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629636  Campbell  The objectives of this research program will be two fold:     1) to build on previous work in the avalanche photodiodes (APD)  photodetectors to develop a realistic model that can be used as a tool to  facilitate device design and optimization and to conduct a systematic  experimental study of the critical structural parameters, including the  bandedge discontinuities, the widths of the barrier and well regions, and  the composition profile of the barrier layers. Tight coupling between the  simulation and experimental work is a strength of this program and will  provide the feedback necessary for understanding and developing these  technologically important photodetectors.    2) It is also the objective of this proposed research to realize new  photodetectors that utilize novel resonantcavity structures to achieve  enhanced performance relative to conventional photodetectors.  A crucial  aspect to achieving these novel photodetectors is a fundamental  understanding of the physical effects that determine their performance. For  example, the resonantcavity approach has been successfully extended to  avalanche photodiodes. However, there are aspects to the impact ionization  process in this type of structure that are not well understood.   The  resonant-cavity structure can provide several performance advantages, one  of which is that the tradeoff between responsivity/bandwidth that is  inherent to conventional PIN photodiodes structures can be circumvented.  For the typical normal-incidence photodetector, a wide bandwidth  necessitates a thin absorption layer which, in turn, results in low quantum  efficiency. The resonant-cavity structure, on the other hand, effectively  decouples the responsivity from the transit-time component of the bandwidth  because the optical signal makes multiple passes across the thin absorbing  layer inside the microcavity. For example, it has been demonstrated with  Si-based resonant-cavity photodiodes that a 10x increase in bandwidth can  be achieve  without sacrificing quantum efficiency. In addition, the narrow  spectral response of these photodetectors may be used to advantage for  applications such as wavelength-division multiplexing. For example, high Q  cavities can provide an integrated filtering function.  ***",
