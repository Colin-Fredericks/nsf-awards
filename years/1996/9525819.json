 "awd_abstract_narration": "Christopher Cramer is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational chemistry program  to begin theoretical calculations of singlet triplet splittings both in vacuo and in solution. The calculations  will be performed with both standard ab-initio methods as well as Density Functional methods. The  calculations will be combined with a solvation model in order to ascertain the effects of solvent on energy  gaps.     The bulk of experimental chemistry, and virtually all of biological chemistry, takes place in solution, or  in condensed phases. Most theoretical calculations apply to molecules that are in the gas phase, and which  do not interact. This project involves augmenting existing theoretical methods, at several levels of theory,  with a solvation model in order to address the properties of molecules in solution. The approach taken  in this work involves approximating the solvent, within the theoretical model. The proposed work will  develop and calibrate these new methods on a wide variety of molecules of chemical and biological  importance.",
