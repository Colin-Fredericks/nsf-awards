 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, supported by the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry program,  provides research funds to Professor Bililign at   North Carolina A&T University, one of the HBCU colleges.   Professor   Bililign will use ab initio calculations to obtain properties of   electronically excited states of free metal atoms.  These calculations   will also yield potential energy curves of some valence and Rydberg   states of excited metal atoms interacting with rare gas atoms and   hydrogen.  The purpose of these calculations is threefold.  The first is   to develop simple analytical model potential functions to describe the   metal-rare gas van der Waals bonding in different electronic states and   to test the model suggested for the bonding.  The second is to understand   dynamical pre-dissociation processes which occur in some of these   systems.  The third aspect of this work aims to understand the reaction   dynamics in laser induced chemical reactions of alkali metal-hydrogen   systems.  The metal atoms involved are Mg, Cd, Zn, Al, Si, Na and Li.  In this research program first principles theoretical calculations will   be performed to understand the mechanism by which electronically excited   metal atoms interact with closed shell rare gas atoms and hydrogen to   form weakly bound complexes.  The end result is to use the results of   these calculations to obtain analytical model potential functions which   describe these interactions.  The results of these calculations help   provide an interpretation and understanding of some experiments in laser   spectroscopy,  as well as the non-equilibrium conditions that occur in   electrical discharge laser systems and astrophysical phenomena.",
