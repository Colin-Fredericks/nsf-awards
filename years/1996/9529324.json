However, there remain many  questions about the nature of quasar evolution. To resolve  some of these questions, a new, deep multicolor survey for  quasars and AGNs has been undertaken with a large format CCD  and the KPNO 4-m telescope. Photometrically calibrated  images in six filters ranging from 034 to 0.86 um and  covering 0.83 sq. deg down to B = 23.8 have been obtained  and reduced. A catalog of over 21,000 stellar objects with  magnitudes or upper limits and error estimates in all the  filters has been assembled. Some follow-up spectroscopy has  also been obtained for selected objects. In this program,  the data analysis will be completed and the data published  and made available to the astronomical community. In  addition, further spectroscopic observations will be made to  determine the properties and evolution of both high redshift  quasars and quasars/AGNs near redshift 2, where a  determination of the luminosity function will provide  significant constraints on models of quasar evolution.  Infrared observations will be used to investigate the  possible evolution of the continuum and emission-line  spectra of high-redshift quasars. The nature and abundances  of the compact, narrow emission-line galaxies will be  studied to determine their chemical history and evolutionary  state.",
