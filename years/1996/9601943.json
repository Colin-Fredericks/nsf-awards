 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to initiate efforts at The Johns  Hopkins University to carry out high resolution structural  investigations of membrane proteins with the acquisition of a CM  120 Philips electron microscope system. The CM 120 is a high  quality transmission electron microscope which is suitable for  studies of biological specimens at atomic and near-atomic  resolution. Our goal is to use both the electron diffraction and  imaging capabilities of the CM 120 microscope to understand the  structural basis for the function of a variety of membrane  proteins.          Membrane proteins play a central role in executing key  cellular functions such as energy conversion, signal transduction  and ion transport. Yet, the structures of only seven membrane  proteins are known at atomic resolution, in contrast to the  nearly one thousand structures known for water-soluble proteins.  Recent developments in high resolution electron microscopy have  the potential to alter this situation dramatically. Of the seven  membrane protein structures known at atomic resolution, two have  been solved recently by applying new techniques in high  resolution microscopy to two-dimensional, rather than  three-dimensional protein crystals.          We anticipate that our use of the CM 120 microscope for  structural studies will occur in two phases. In the first phase,  we will initiate work on the following five projects, four of  which represent direct extensions of experiments already being  carried out in collaborative efforts with external electron  microscopy centers:      Structural \"snapshots\" of steps in energy conversion by   bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump (S. Subramaniam,   with Dr. R. Henderson at MRC, Cambridge, England)      Structural basis of water transport by aquaporin, the water   channel in red blood cells (P. Agre, with Dr. A. Engel at the   Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland)      Structural basis of the association of myosin-I with the cell   membrane (T. Pollard, with Dr. R. Milliga n at the Scripps   Research Institute, La Jolla, CA)      Structure of the voltage-gated potassium channel from   Drosophila (M. Li, with Dr. N. Unwin at MRC, Cambridge, England)      Structure determination of the IP3 receptor, a ligand-gated   calcium channel (W. Agnew and S. Subramaniam)          From these initial efforts, our goal is to lay the  foundation for an institutional resource to carry out high  resolution electron microscopy. A number of biologically  important membrane receptors including a variety of sensory  transducers and ion channels are currently being studied in  laboratories at Johns Hopkins University. We fully expect that in  the second phase of research facilitated by the the microscope,  the structures of these receptors, as well as those of a variety  of other cellular components can be successfully analyzed.",
