It will  culminate in the production of a  monograph which is hoped will serve  as a state-of-the-art guide to  analysis and design for seismic  retrofitting and new construction  in steel. The seminar and monograph  will reveal weaknesses and voids in  current American and Japanese  practices as well as new  technologies that are the most  promising for improving seismic  performance.  They will foster  change to eliminate these  deficiencies from current standards  and specifications and provide new  design concepts and methodologies.    This activity is a part of US-Japan  cooperative science program  administered jointly by the  International Division of NSF and  Japanese Society of promotion of  Sciences (JSPS).  ***",
