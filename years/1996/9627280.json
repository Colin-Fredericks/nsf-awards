 "awd_abstract_narration": "9627280  Dhondt    Cornell's Laboratory of Ornithology will develop the \"Cornell Nest  Box Network (CNN)\".  This is an educational/research project that  will enable lay people to participate in scientific research and it  builds on a successful NSF grant \"National Science Experiments\".   For this project, CNN participants will build and place nest boxes  in their communities and monitor the boxes gathering information on  the breeding success of their occupants.  Participants will  summarize and analyze their data and then send it to the Lab for  more comprehensive analysis.  Lab biologists will analyze the  compiled data and report results in a variety of media including  scientific reports and popular newsletters.  The CNN includes both  an educational and research agenda.  Participants will learn about  birds while participating directly in the scientific process.  The  research questions, requiring huge, continent-wide databases, will  focus on the effects of acid rain on bird populations, geographic  variation in avian clutch size, effects of ectoparasites on nesting  birds and population dispersal, among others.  The protocol will  encourage group participation and will be especially suitable for  families.  It will involve a corps of trained \"ambassadors\" who  will help sustain the project a local levels.  One of the goals of  the project is to move participants up a ladder of science  knowledge from projects involving minimal knowledge and skill to  those requiring more.  It also addresses national education  standards that call for increased opportunities for students to  engage in extended inquiry and authentic research activities.   After the fourth development year, this research/education project  will become self-sustaining.",
