The first study is  of  the  magnetic properties of superfluid 3He, focusing  on  the  discrepancy between SQUID and NMR measurements  of  the  static susceptibility. The second study is of thin films  of  3He   in   magnetic  fields  sufficiently   small   that   a  wo-dimensional  nuclear  ferromagnetic  transition  can   be  manifested.  In  these  magnetic  fields,  conventional  NMR  techniques  are unusable. Finally, electrical conduction  in  reduced  dimensionality systems will be  studied,  including  the   physics  of  disorder  in  artificial  two-dimensional  networks of effectively one-dimensional wires.  %%%  This   project   is  a  study  of  materials   at   ultralow  temperatures   combined   with,  and   supported   by,   the  development of ultralow temperature experimental techniques,  including  advanced  low-noise amplifiers.  At  temperatures  near  1  mK  (0.001 degrees above Absolute  Zero)  the  rare  isotope  of helium (helium-3) changes to a superfluid  whose  magnetic  properties  are not yet  well  understood.   These  magnetic  properties will be studied in this  project.  Thin  films  of liquid helium-3 will also be studied because  they  have  proved to be an excellent model for magnetism  in  two  dimensions.  Artificial  one- and  two-dimensional  metallic  systems   will  be  manufactured  and  studied   to   better  understand the role of disorder in natural physical systems.  ***",
