 "awd_abstract_narration": "9513059  Iwasa    This award supports a three-year cooperative  research  project between Professor  Yuki-Kazu Iwasa, Department of Mechanical Engineering,  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Professor Osami  Tsukamoto, Faculty of Engineering, Yokohama National  University, Yokohama, Japan.  The project involves other  U.S. investigators from the Brookhaven National Laboratory,  Los Alamos National Laboratory, Rensselaer Polytechnic  Institute, and Iowa State  University.  The specific issues  to be covered in this phase of the collaborative effort are:  (1) AC losses in high-temperature superconductors (HTS),  particularly the impact of conductor design,  (2) conductor  processing techniques for \"long\" HTS, and (3) stability and  protection of power transmission cables.  The United  States  and Japan are the leaders and rivals in superconducting  magnet technology and are the nations most intensely engaged  in high-Tc superconductor research and development.  At  present, since the R&D effort in Japan on high-Tc  superconductivity, both in university and industry, is  substantially greater than it is in the United States, it is  likely that this exchange program will greatly benefit U.S.  researchers.  ***",
