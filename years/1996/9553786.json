 "awd_abstract_narration": "The San Francisco Bay Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation, led by San Jose State University and San Francisco State University, will implement a bold program that will identify incoming freshmen, especially from underrepresented groups who are interested in becoming teachers. These future math, science, and elementary school teachers will be offered newly designed \"core\" and \"capstone\" science and math courses, careful mentoring by faculty and local teachers, hands-on teaching experiences, and tutorial assistance as they progress from their freshman year through their credential program and during their first three years as classroom teachers. Major components of the program are: 1) promotion of centers of teaching excellence and recruitment of future teachers from several target populations; 2) preparation of science and math majors entering secondary school teaching and of all students entering elementary school teaching; 3) extensive early field experiences; 4) tutor/mentor/advisor programs; 5) workshops for science and math faculty resulting in their significant involvement in curriculum reform; 6) revision of core science and math courses, and creation of innovative capstone/integrated courses; and 7) a support network for new science and math teachers. Approximately 4000 students per year will be impacted by this project.",
