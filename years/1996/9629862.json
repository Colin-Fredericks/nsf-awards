This method determines the enthalpy and volume  changes in these reactions.  Given that the free energy of  many of these reactions are known, the entropy can be  calculated.  The charge seperation in the initial  photoreactions causes volume changes dominated by  electrostriction, which is directly related to the  dielectric response of the system.  This is a critical  parameter in electron transfer reactions.  The measured  enthalpy also provides a direct measure of the thermodynamic  efficiency of the system.  A longer term objective is to  determine the enthalpy and volume changes of the individual  steps in the cycle of oxygen formation.  %%%  Photosynthesis is an efficient system that converts sunlight  into  chemical energy which supports life on earth.  The  understanding of this system is a major goal of much  research.  To achieve this goal it is necessary to have  detailed knowledge of both the kinetics, i.e. how fast do  the steps in the process happen, and the thermodynamics,  i.e., what are their energetics or efficiencies.  The past  decades have produced major progress in the first area. This  work is aimed at producing the required progress in the  energetics area using the new photoacoustic methodology.  A  practical application of this research will be development  of rapid unambiguous assays  of photosynthetic  efficiency.  Calculations of oceanic productivity depend critically on  photosynthetic efficiency.  It is also possible that the  photoacoustic methodology could be used in the field to  determine photosynthetic efficiency and water content of  leaves.  ***",
