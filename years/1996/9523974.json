The excellent charged-particle detector resolution recently attained in resonant particle decay spectroscopy will allow levels in lieht nuclei to be studied within a few hundred keV of their a emission threshold.  The largely unexplored rank 3 analyzing powers can now be studied using the 7Li beam from the laser-pumped polarized ion source.  In addition, the high beam currents and polarizations from this source will permit detailed investigation of the origin of the tensor force in 6Li scattering.  Present and future laser capabilities along with beams from the tandem/LINAC will allow precise tests of quantum electrodynamics calculations of energy levels of low to intermediate Z helium-like ions.  The Hall B experime ntal physics program at CEBAF is set to commence and the capabilities of the CLAS will be aimed at examination of nucleon resonances and strangeness production.  Construction of the Ring-Imaging Cherenkov system for PHENIX is well under way.  Programs of radioactive beam scattering at MSU and conversion electron and ray studies at GAMMASPHERE are proposed. ***                                         ;                                                 Oh     +'  0                                               (       L       p                     S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i o n                           (                                                   &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               $       H       l                                           R:\\WWUSER\\ABSTRACT.DOT              9523974                             Gwendolyn C.
