 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9630558  Lippel   The Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)  is a revolutionary new instrument that is being widely used in studying surfaces at the nanometer level (atomic scale).  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from L3 Consulting will introduce low cost Scanning Tunneling Microscopes (STMs) into the first-year college curriculum in Physics and Chemistry.  Phase I SBIR research at L3 Consulting resulted in a design which uses advanced electroceramic actuators, audio-quality data converters, and a digital signal processor to produce a very inexpensive microscope.  L3 Consulting also demonstrated how this microscope would enable students to image atomic steps at the surface of metals and semiconductors, examine integrated circuits or compact discs with resolution below the diffraction limit of optical microscopes, and otherwise explore physical phenomena at the nanometer scale.  Continuing efforts in Phase II will develop prototypes of the instrument and of accompanying laboratory exercises, test these prototypes with college students in regular classes, and evaluate the impact of these new tools on students' interest in and understanding of the physical sciences.  The courseware will emphasize the relationship between microscopic features of materials and their macroscopic properties.  It will encourage students to inquire how the abstract fundamental concepts stressed in introductory courses can be applied to explain the behavior of real-world materials and devices.  Students will gain valuable skill's by learning how to operate these microscopes, how to interpret the images obtained, and how to extrapolate from those images.  College and university faculty can present STMs as examples of modern research instruments and can use STM-based labs to expand their coverage of contemporary physics and chemistry.   Successful Phase II research will lead to a refined design for a microscope/ courseware package suitable for commercial production and distribution.  The primary  target market for the product is formed by large introductory classes in physics and chemistry which are taken by students of engineering, medicine and the allied health professions, and architecture, as well as by future scientists.  Derivative products might be suitable at other educational levels or for industrial use.  ***",
