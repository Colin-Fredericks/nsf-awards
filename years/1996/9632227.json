The objective is to better describe the macroscopic behavior of two-phase flow systems by studying phenomena at the particle, bubble, or other microstructural length scale of the disperse phase, by using a combination of theoretical and computational methods.  The effect of particle Stokes number and phase concentration in flows where both inertial and viscous effects are significant will be investigated.  Numerical simulations will be used to evaluate velocity fluctuations in two-phase flow and to analyze the flow stability.  The Reynolds stress, eddy viscosity, and eddy diffusivity will be numerically simulated and eventually modeled.  A computational technique, in which the Stokes flow interactions are computed by dividing the particles into groups of varying sizes and combining the fields induced by the particles within each group by the method of multiple expansion, will be carried out for suspensionq containing 1-10 thousand particles per cell.      The proposed project, if successful, will provide improved basic understanding and numerical simulation tools for gas-solid flows, bubbly flows and composite materials deformation, of relevance in numerous processing industries and natural phenomena.  ***",
