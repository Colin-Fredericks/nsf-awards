The workshop will include modern concepts and methods in  structural reliability and their role in the development of the  new load and resistance factor design (LRFD) code for highway  bridges.  Also, reliability-based requirements for inspection of  bridges will be developed, maintenance strategies for assurance  of high bridge safety will be explored, and methods for  optimization of bridge maintenance programs will be outlined.  Finally, on going research results in bridge load models,  deterioration models, and the integration of reliability-based  assessments in bridge management systems will be discussed.    This workshop will provide transfer of information on modern  reliability technology to state highway officials, state bridge  engineers, bridge inspectors, bridge designers, and bridge  maintenance personnel.  It will provide a unique forum and  opportunity to individuals who manage the U.S. bridge  infrastructure system, to better understand and apply modern  reliability concepts and methods in highway bridge engineering.  The documents of this workshop will be widely distributed  throughout the United States to all Departments of  Transportation, highway bridge officials and practicing bridge  engineers.  ***",
