The step edges of a rough film are sites of reduced symmetry  and the magnetic moments located at these sites must  experience different exchange constants as well as different  anisotropy fields.  The principal objective in this grant is  to develop a consistent theory of magnetic hysteresis that  connects the structure and morphology of these materials to  their coercivity and remanence  The program calls for  extensive numerical calculations augmented by analytic and  numerical analysis of toy models and continuum equations  suggested by the simulations. The calculations offer direct  evaluation of various experimentally measurable quantities  and thus afford comparison with the experiments.  %%%  Magnetic thin films are used in  a variety of applications,  the most well known being in memory devices.   This grant is  comprehensive program of  theoretical research to study the  magnetic properties of realistic thin films i.e. the program  incorporates the structural and morphological effects (of  surface roughness) in an essential way.  ***",
