 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9561365  Liszka         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop, formalize, and extend the mathematical theory and computational algorithms for the h-p adaptive meshless analysis method.  The feasibility of the method for removing all need for a computational mesh to solve discrete forms of mathematical models of interdisciplinary physical systems will be determined.  Asymptotically correct error estimation techniques and combined refinement and higher-order adaptivity will be developed.  The combination of error estimation and adaptivity within the context of a meshless environment will eliminate the need for the analyst (scientist/engineer) to determine numerical accuracy of computational simulations.  The method's mathematical properties include full polynomial reproducibility, local interpolation, high-order (spectral) accuracy, and C-infinity basis functions; moreover, the spatial (and potentially temporal) discretization is represented by a simple open covering of the physical domain, and thus can be full automated.  Completion of this research effort will result in a major advance in the area of computational simulation, with the potential for replacing existing software using finite element and finite difference techniques.  Solution of difficult problems involving moving/deforming domains will be enabled by the new technology due to its meshless properties.  Commercial benefit to the US economy is enormous due to the removal of the manpower-intensive mesh generation process, and the ability to quantify and minimize the error in computational simulations.  Emerging concepts such as Virtual Testing and Virtual Prototyping will be enabled by the proposed research.       The proposed research and development effort will result in new mathematical theory, computational algorithms, and prototype implementations of an object-oriented problem-solving environment implementing the method for emerging high-performance computer architectures.  Commercial applicatio ns of the technology will include a suite of object-oriented, interdisciplinary, scientific and engineering analysis software systems for structural analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational electromagnetics, multi-disciplinary optimization, environmental sciences, climate modeling, and semi-conductor simulation.  All computational simulation being performed using traditional techniques can potentially benefit from the proposed research.  ***",
