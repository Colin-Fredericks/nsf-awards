 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to determine the                      mechanisms by which mycorrhizal fungi influence the major                       components of plant fitness.  Mycorrhizal fungi are present in                  nearly all terrestrial ecosystems and have been shown to influence              nutrient uptake, growth and reproductive host plants under                      controlled conditions.  Unfortunately, very little is known about               the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on the population biology of their             host plants, particularly under field conditions.  Experiments in               the laboratory have shown that mycorrhizal infection can increase               both fecundity and offspring quality.  For example, it was shown                that infection of the maternal generation increased reproductive                output in the offspring generation.  Therefore, the effects of                  infection on maternal fecundity and offspring quality will be                   assessed separately in the proposed study.  A combination of field              and greenhouse experiments incorporating demographic and                        physiological measurements is proposed to establish the mechanistic             basis for observed phenomena.  In one study, maternal generation                host plants (Abutilon theophrasti) will be grown in the field in a              3 x 2 factorial experiment (3 levels of P amendment;  mycorrhizal,              non-mycorrhizal).  Growth, nutrient uptake, reproductive output,                leaf photosynthesis and root phosphatase activities will be                     monitored for two seasons.  In the second year of this study, a                 third factor (natural reestablishment vs. thinning to a standard                density) will be incorporated in order to determine whether, in                 addition to influencing fecundity, maternal treatments have                     independent effects on offspring performance within the maternal                environment.  In another 2 year study, seeds collected from mother              plants (from the various maternal treatments) will be transplanted              to another location in the field to determine whether interactions              between offspring environment (M/NM x high P/low P) and maternal                treatment (see above) exists for offspring vigor.  Seeds collected              from mother plants will also be used in controlled greenhouse                   studies in which the effects of maternal treatment on offspring                 vigor mediated by seed weight will be distinguished from those                  mediated by seed P content.  In addition, greenhouse experiments in             which offspring from contrasting maternal treatments will be                    allowed to interact will allow a determination as to whether                    maternal treatment can influence competitive behavior.  The results             from these experiments should greatly increase the understanding of             the effect of mycorrhizal fungi on plant fitness.",
