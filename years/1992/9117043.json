 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on the factors that                        affect the rate of flocculation of particles in water                           suspension when subjected to contacts with metallic salt                        coagulants and coagulant aids used in processes for                             treatment of water.  Experimental variables being                               considered are the effects of temperature, coagulant                            dosage, pH, concentration of suspended substances and                           sulfate concentrations.  Research is being conducted at                         bench scale.  Coagulants include ferric and aluminum salts                      and the coagulant aids include cationic polymers.                                                                                                               Results of this project are expected to improve our                             understanding of flocculation, an important unit operation                      conducted in treatment of both water and wastewater.  This                      understanding is further expected to provide the basis for                      improvement in the engineering design of treatment systems                      that include flocculation as a unit operation, and in the                       improvement of existing treatment plants that use this                          process in their water treatment and wastewater treatment                       operations.",
