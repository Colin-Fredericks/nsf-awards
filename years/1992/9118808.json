 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistical decision theory attempts to provide a formal                   approach to decision making and statistical inference by asking                 that explicit numerical criteria be given and that the merits of                a statistical procedure or decision be assessed by these                        criteria.  Since its introduction in the 1940's, decision theory                has served as a unifying force for apparently diverse branches of               statistics.  Its unifying nature is continually being                           rediscovered; for instance, a large body of recent work on                      function estimation has been found to be intimately related to                  classical minimax theory.  Decision theory has also provided the                basis for much of the foundational development in statistics.  It               also has a very practical side, and is increasingly being used in               the modeling and analysis of real decision problems in business,                economics, medicine, law, reliability and quality control, risk                 assessment, and numerous other fields.                                               This project will support the Fifth Purdue International                   Symposium on Statistical Decision Theory and Related Topics to be               held from June 14-20, 1992 at Purdue University.  The broad                     topics chosen for this symposium include classical subjects                     within or related to decision theory, such as                                   admissibility/minimaxity/invariance, sequential analysis,                       hierarchical and empirical Bayes analysis, multiple decision                    theory, optimal designs, and model selection.  Newer topics will                be included such as decision-theoretic function estimation,                     information/complexity, semiparametric models and adaptive                      methods, neural nets/influence diagrams/graphical structures,                   multiple prior/utility problems, computational Bayesian                         developments, and decision-theoretic aspects of noninformative                  priors, as well as a wide variety of applied problems in decision               theory.  Previous symposia in this series on decision theory and                related topics were held in 1961, 1970, 1976, 1981, and 1986.",
