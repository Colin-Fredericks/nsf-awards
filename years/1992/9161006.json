 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue research on a new method to analyze                  blood flow in deep tissues of the body which have slow blood                    flows and small volumes of movement using doppler ultrasound.  In               order to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio from these tissues a                contrast agent, consisting of galactose microparticles that trap                air bubbles, will be employed.  Due to the nonlinear properties                 of this contrast agent, the doppler shifted second harmonic of                  the transmitted ultrasonic frequency will provide a signal with                 desirable properties for use in the system.  At the second                      harmonic, the doppler shifted echoes from tissues not containing                the contrast agent (surrounding tissues) will be reduced in                     comparison to tissues containing the agent (capillaries).                                                                                                       The concept previously was tested using a mock flow system.  It                 is now proposed to do in-vitro experiments using excised animal                 organs.  The design of hardware which will allow the transmission               of one ultrasonic frequency and the detection of the second                     harmonic of that frequency also is a part of the project.                                                                                                       This research is extremely important since no other medical                     device is available to make such critical measurements.  When                   fully tested and developed, this device should be able to compete               in the medical imaging device marketplace.",
