 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human-machine interaction is a critical component of complex,                  highly automated systems such as space shuttle ground control and               flexible manufacturing systems.  In such systems, typically a team              of human operators acts as supervisory controllers:  monitoring                 data, adjusting parameters, and detecting, diagnosing, and                      compensating for failures.  In the past, most research efforts in               this area have focused on a single human operator:  modeling one                operator's interaction with a complex system; designing single-                 user displays, and so forth.  With the advent of knowledge-based                technology, more \"intelligent\" tools are appearing in the context               of monitoring and supervisory control.  Still, such tools are                   designed for use by a single operator.  The intent of this project              is to build models and methods to support cooperation between human             supervisory controllers and between humans and \"intelligent                     associate systems\" in supervisory control.  Specifically, the three                                                                                             objectives of the proposed are to: 1) Develop a framework for                   modeling distributed supervisory control; 2) Develop prototype                  knowledge-based tools based on the modeling framework; and 3) Apply             the modeling framework and collaborative knowledge-based tool                   design concepts to supervisory control environment:  satellite                  ground control at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.",
