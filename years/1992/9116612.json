 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science               project between Professor Peter Barnes, Physics Department,                     Carnegie Mellon University, and Professor Fujio Takeutchi,                      Department of Physics, University of Kyoto Sangyo, Kyoto, Japan.                The U.S. group, which includes other investigators from Carnegie                Mellon University and the University of New Mexico, will travel                 to Japan to develop and test equipment to be used in an experiment              at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL).  The experiment (E836)                 has been approved by Brookhaven authorities to operate at the AGS               accelerator.  The experiment is a follow-on of one already                      performed to search for the bound state of six quarks, two of them              strange quarks.                                                                                                                                                 The U.S. team will work on equipment performance tests at the                   National Laboratory of High Energy Physics (KEK), where beam                    time at the synchrotron is available, and will compare and check                data analysis performed independently by the U.S. and Japanese                  groups.  It is also planned to develop detectors at KEK for an                  experiment related to the search for double strange hypernuclei that            should exist if the H particle does not exist.  The Japanese group,             which includes investigators from Kyoto University and the Kyoto                University of Education, will travel to Brookhaven to take part in              the experiment.  They will install their equipment at the AGS/BNL               and take data.  A goal of this project is to develop and maintain a             cohesive effort and to develop future avenues of collaboration                  between U.S. and Japanese physicists.",
