 "awd_abstract_narration": "The decision-making of the United States Supreme Court is of                    substantial interest to social scientists, journalists, and                     laypersons alike.  Beginning in 1983, the Law and Social Science                Program provided support for the construction of a multi-user data              base that codifies a wide range of dimensions relevant to Supreme               Court decision-making, and makes these data available to social                 scientists and other parties through the Interuniversity Consortium             for Political and Social Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  This                 grant will extend the data base and therefore, enhance scholarship              on the Supreme Court.                                                                                                                                           Specifically, this collaborative project with Spaeth, the principal             investigator of the original project, and Jan Palmer will extend                the NSF-funded U.S. Supreme Court Judicial Data Base (now covering              the Warren, Burger and Rehnquist years) to encompass comparable                 data on the official votes of the Vinson Court (1946-1953).  A                  second extension integrates data related to the official votes with             a data base created by Palmer that contains the justices'                       conference voting and opinion assignments.  This data base, which               encompasses the Vinson Court, will be extended to include the                   Warren Court.  The resulting project will span 23 terms of the                  Supreme Court (1946-1968) and the behavior of the 20 justices who               then served.  As with the original data base, these extensions will             be archived at the Inter-University Consortium, and will be                     available as an SPSS export file.  The richness of the resulting                data will tremendously enhance the formulation of theory and                    testing of hypotheses with respect to the Supreme Court.",
