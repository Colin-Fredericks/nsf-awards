The workshop will review                                    and analyze the current state-of-the-art in                                     relation to a range of earthquake hazard                                        mitigation in architectural and nonstructural                                   systems, and in relation to broader land-use                                    planning issues and physical urban design                                       issues.

As one of                                       three regional workshops on the topic subject,                                  this workshop will focus on East-Coast issues.
