 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the development of a course on modern                    processor design that will focus on instruction level parallel                  (ILP) processing in single chip processors and will include                     techniques for superpipelined and superscalar processor                         design, instruction scheduling techniques for ILP type                          processor, and instruction-level performance evaluation and                     characterization.  A new processor design methodology                           involving experimentation and quantitative analysis of the                      performance impact of specific design features will be                          presented in the course.  Dr. Shen will be writing a textbook                   as well as a set of lecture notes for distribution to other                     institutions.                                                                                                                                                   This award is for the development of a senior-level computer                    engineering course on modern processor design.  The course                      will address contemporary processor design techniques relevant                  to the design of current and future generation processors that                  exploit instruction level parallelisms.  Examples include                       superpipelined, superscalar, supersymmetry and Very Long                        Instruction Word (VLIW) processors.  A textbook and a set of                    lecture notes will be disseminated as part of this project.",
