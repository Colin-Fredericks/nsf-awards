 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the use of robotic hands in                       automated robotic assembly.  In many assemblies, the clearances                 allowed between mating parts are smaller than the uncertainties                 associated with a robotic assembly cell and though it is possible               to reduce these uncertainties by using special purpose mechanisms               and high precision fixturing devices, this limits flexibility and               increases cost.  It is preferable for the manipulator to use                    force/torque feedback during the execution of assembly mating                   operations to reduce alignment errors between parts which are                   caused by the uncertainties.  By incorporating a robotic hand                   into the robot manipulator system, the performance of the                       assembly cell will be improved.  The accuracy of force/torque                   measurements will be increased by putting sensors on both the                   manipulator and the hand.  The hand will serve as both a general                fixturing device so that the grasped part can be held rigidly                   during assembly and a micromanipulator so that fine adjustments                 to the position of the grasped part can be made.  The central                   goal of this project is a general and automated method for                      synthesizing force/torque guided motion strategies which operate                on a manipulator/hand system and are capable of reducing                        uncertainty-induced errors during assembly execution. //",
