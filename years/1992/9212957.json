 "awd_abstract_narration": "The MINT Center at the University of                                            Alabama will purchase equipment to upgrade                                      an existing Vac-Tec four target sputtering                                      system.  Specifically the proposal requests                                     funds for retro-fitting a computer based                                        control system and the installation of a                                        dedicated residual gas analyzer.  The                                           equipment will be used to accelerate progress                                   on several research projects, including an                                      investigation of the physical, magnetic and                                     magnetoresistive properties of giant                                            magnetoresistance multilayers for use in MR                                     heads, and of the properties of sputtered FeN                                   based materials for both thin film recording                                    heads and media.  Both of these projects                                        currently receive significant NSF funding in                                    the form of individual investigator grants.  A                                  continuing commitment to these education and                                    training of graduate students is evidenced by                                   13 students supported on related projects.                                      The performance increases, which may be                                         possible using these materials, especially in                                   atomically engineered multilayer                                                configurations, make them very attractive                                       candidates for exploitation in the data                                         recording industry.  The routine production of                                  multilayers composed of a large number of                                       identical bilayers and of reactively sputtered                                  FeN films and multilayers requires a high                                       degree of process control.  This control will                                   be provided by the proposed upgrade greatly                                     enhancing the ongoing research program.",
