 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in             Laxenburg, Austria, is a multinational, nongovernmental                         institution established in 1972 to conduct research in systems                  analysis \"in relation to problems of modern society arising from                scientific and technological development.\"  The Institute is                    governed by a council comprised of representatives from 15                      National Member Organizations (NMOs), including the United                      States, Russia, Canada, Japan, and several Western and Eastern                  European countries.  The                                                        grant will support research in three program areas:  (1) Global                 Environmental Change, (2) Global Economic and Technological                     Transitions, and (3) Systems Methods for the Analysis of Global                 Issues.  The primary goal of the Global Environmental Change                    program is to advance understanding and develop the means to                    assess the implications of the interactions between human                       development and the environment.  Specific areas of concern                     include emission, transformation, and transport of toxic materials              and pollutants; changes in water resource availability and quality;             degradation of soils, biological resources, and ecosystems; and                 implications for managed agricultural ecosystems.  The Global                   Economic and Technological Transitions program is concerned with                issues arising from the transition from centrally planned economies             to market economies, the integration of these economies into world              markets, the impact of technological developments on all                        economies, and the complex relationships between the economy and                the environment. Research in the Systems Methods program aims at                an analytical approach uniting mathematical modeling and other                  methods that can deal with complexity, coupling of diverse                      processes, uncertainty, and nonlinearity.  IIASA maintains a                    balanced research program in this area, with an emphasis on                     applying methodological expertise to applied problems in its                    substantive program areas.",
