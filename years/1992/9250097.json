 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to continue to develop and explore the                               enhancement of student learning of science through an                           emphasis on student research.  Key to the success of this                       approach are technologies including: student field stations                     using low-cost MBL field monitors, probes, and instruments;                     experimental growth chambers; and software tools.  Building                     on materials and technology developed so far in the project,                    we plan a careful evaluation and continued development of                       our approach in a two-year field test starting September,                       1992.  The data this yields about the role of the                               technologies and strategies employed will answer important                      questions about the power and feasibility of our approach.                                                                                                      The major components of our instructional strategy are to:                      1) focus on global ecology; 2) establish school research                        stations with increasing technological capacity; 3) offer                       students and teachers a suite of observations and                               experiments in global ecology that can be easily                                implemented; 4) foster the development of student research                      skills: and 5) create a community of student researchers                        knit together through telecomputing and other shared                            experiences.  Our work in this phase of the Global Lab                          project will concentrate on supporting and evaluating the                       field test, developing technologies that fill gaps in our                       ability to offer experimental global ecology, developing                        supporting curricula material, and creating teacher support                     strategies.",
