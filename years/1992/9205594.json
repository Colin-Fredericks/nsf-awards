Saline wastewaters resulting from                                               industrial processes have the                                                   potential for being made less                                                   environmentally damaging by a                                                   process that removes organic                                                    contaminants from them before being                                             reused or discharged to the                                                     environment.  Results of this                                                   research are expected to provide                                                the basis for engineering design of                                             an innovative biotechnological                                                  process for treatment of                                                        highly saline wastewaters such as                                               those produced in the                                                           manufacture of pesticides,                                                      herbicides and polyhydric                                                       chemicals.  ***",
