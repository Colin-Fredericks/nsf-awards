The results of this investigation will form an               essential component of a doctoral thesis concerning the                         comparative syntax of nominal structure across Romance languages.               Data will be collected primarily by interviewing and recording                  native Walloon speakers living in the region of the Ardennes, as                well as by consulting local scholars in Louvain-la-Neuve and                    Liege and examining texts in university and public libraries.                   The syntactic phenomena to be investigated include adjective                    placement, nominal agreement patterns, clitic constructions, and                possessive pronouns.  The proposed activity will be facilitated                 by the collaboration of Professor Michel Francard,  a Walloon                   dialectologist at the Universite Catholique de Louvain.                              The significance of this project is twofold:  Firstly, as                  preliminary dissertation research has shown, unexpected syntactic               patterns of Walloon noun phrases shed light on an array of                      phenomena that have eluded adequate explanation in recent work on               comparative Romance syntax.  In addition, this research                         undertaking will provide the important opportunity to gather and                analyze syntactic data from this moribund language that, until                  recently, has been studied only descriptively.",
