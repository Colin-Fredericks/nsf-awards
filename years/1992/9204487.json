 "awd_abstract_narration": "This underlying theme of this project is an attempt to                     understand the roots of classes of functions which arise in                     complex analysis and number theory called zeta functions.  There                are several important sets of zeta functions to be analyzed: (i)                linear combinations of Euler products; (ii) Epstein zeta                        functions (of both the rational and irrational type); (iii)                     Selberg zeta functions associated with cofinite Fuchsian groups;                (iv) L- functions associated with eigenfunctions of the Laplace                 operator taken over fundamental domains or Riemann surfaces.                    Several methods will be employed.  One involves the variation of                parameters in the definition of functions.  As the parameters                   move about, the roots trace paths which are studied from a                      statistical/dynamical point of view.  Supercomputer analysis is                 also used to unravel complex relationships in cases where                       functions form finite dimensional vector spaces.  Two particular                goals are to give growth rates of the roots and to determine                    whether or not all roots lie on simple subsets such as lines.                        This work has important application to fundamental and long-               standing questions in number theory.  It also leads to new uses                 of supercomputing in the more theoretical areas of mathematical                 analysis, both as an experimental tools and one which can give                  sharp probability estimates in situations where precise                         information is too difficult to extract from the functional                     definitions.",
