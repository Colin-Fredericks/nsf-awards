 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments in the international economy have raised new                questions and possibilities about international macroeconomic                   policy.  Many of these questions have to do with changing or                    reforming the institutions of policymaking.  From an economic                   perspective, analysis of these questions involves specifying                    alternative rules or systems for the conduct of policy-- say                    feedback rules for interest rates or exchange rates--and examining              how these rules work by stochastically simulating them in a                     rational expectations econometric model.  From a practical or                   institutional perspective, they involve examining the role and                  operation of the institutions of macroeconomic policy making and                policy analysis--including the international financial                          institutions.  For example, the trend toward regional trading areas             has raised questions about coordination of economic policy both                 across countries and within countries, including macroeconomic                  policy, labor market policy, environmental policy, and trade                    policy.  Questions about the need for increased monetary                        integration, cooperation in financial market regulation, exchange               rate stabilization, common currency, or the coordination of fiscal              policy have been raised.                                                                                                                                        This research focuses on developing an analytical approach to these             types of policy issues.  The approach builds on the principal                   investigator's earlier research on international economic models.               The proposal is divided into four parts.  The first part                        investigates the use of rational expectations econometric models                for forecasting.  The second part uses full information maximum                 likelihood techniques to estimate a multi-country econometric model             which would be updated and modified as part of this estimation.                 The third part examines the practical significance of the Lucas                 critique by using stochastic simulations of a rational expectations             econometric model.  The fourth part focuses on policy design and                implementation issues using the framework developed in the first                three parts.  A key element in the proposed research is the                     examination of alternative ways to improve the implementation of                policy rules or systems that result from policy design research.",
