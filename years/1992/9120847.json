These                    studies will focus on the development of one module of linguistic               theory, namely Binding theory.  Throughout the course of this                   investigation, the investigators will to chart many important                   aspects concerning children's development of knowledge of                       Binding.  The Chinese data will be collected in Taiwan and the                  English data will be collected in the United States.  Several                   topics and theoretical approaches will be considered.  In                       particular, the researchers will investigate the following                      interrelated topics: 1) The interaction between syntactic and                   pragmatic principles on children's acquisition of bound-variable                versus referential pronouns.  2) The relationship between Chinese               children's apparent lack of long-distance binding and their                     acceptance of object antecedents for the reflexive ziji.  3) The                possibility of explaining anomalous acquisition phenomena by a                  parametrized theory with independent parameters versus a richly                 interrelated developmental theory.  4) The relationship between                 children's knowledge of long-distance binding and subject-                      orientation and the theory of ziji-movement in Logical Form.  5)                Children's knowledge of non-canonical chain-binding and binding                 of adjuncts.",
