 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with computational research in                  algebraic geometry and topology.  The principal investigator will               study Newton's method for solving polynomial equations describing               arbitrary zero locii, paying particular attention to the case                   where the number of equations exceeds the codimension.  He will                 also study algorithms for producing topological data of a                       combinatorial nature from such equations, and the question of                   recognizing computationally when two such topological                           descriptions agree.  In addition, he will research an extension                 of the Groebner basis algorithm to the real numbers, for                        algebraically manipulating polynomial equations.  Finally, he                   will consider the Jacobian Conjecture.                                               This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                    origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field                makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields,                as well as, in theoretically computer science and robotics.",
