 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lignin, a major plant constituent, is crucial to the efficient                  mechanical support and the defense system of plants.  The                       adaptability of plants to changes and stress in their environment               in order to survive is due primary to the existence of lignin.  For             instance, when a plant is forced out of it natural, equilibrium                 position in space by an environmental compression stress, such as               bending, a unique growth pattern involving the formation of a high              amount and an abnormal type of lignin is initiated to reinforce the             cell wall architecture in order to restore the natural, equilibrium             orientation of the plant.  Collectively, the resultant tissues                  formed under such a phenomenon is called \"compression wood\".  We                have discovered a unique enzyme, 4-hydroxycinnamate:  CoA ligase,               whose activity is significantly induced in developing tissues of                loblolly pine seedlings subjected to compressional stress.  We                  propose a comprehensive study on this unique metabolic response to              the compressional stress by first investigating the molecular                   biology of this particular enzyme.  The overall long term project               goal is to illuminate the development of compression wood in                    compressionally stressed loblolly seedlings at the molecular level              and establish a model system which can be used to probe the                     underlying signals triggering the metabolic changes stimulated by               compressional stress.  The significance of this project is its role             as a foundation from which further investigation of how plants                  perceive and respond to both normal and altered environmental                   compression signals can be achieved at a gene level.",
