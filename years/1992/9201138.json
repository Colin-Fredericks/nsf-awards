 "awd_abstract_narration": "Uncertainty pervades real world scenarios, and must therefore be                incorporated into every information system that attempts to                     provide a complete and accurate model of the real world.  Yet,                  present generation information systems have very limited                        capabilities in this regard.  On the other hand, many theoretical               models have been proposed for the management of uncertainty, but                often without thorough understanding of the actual problems faced               by researchers, developers, designers and users of information                  systems.  This project concentrates on a planning workshop that                 will bring together leading researchers in the scientific                       communities of information systems (e.g., database systems,                     information retrieval systems, expert systems, office information               systems) and uncertainty modeling (often working within                         frameworks such as mathematical logic, probability theory, fuzzy                set theory, possibility theory, and evidential models) to study                 the needs of the information systems community and to tap the                   expertise of the uncertainty modeling community, for solutions                  that respond to these needs.  This workshop will promote true                   dialogue between these two scientific communities; it will                      establish the state of the art in this field, and will set the                  course for future research.  The project, which is co-sponsored                 by the European Esprit program, will foster collaborations                      between researchers in the United States and Western Europe.",
