 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Dean and Graybill will continue their dendroclimatological                 work to reconstruct past climates in the United States Southwest.               Because the size and configuration of annual growth rings in                    trees are affected by changes in rainfall and other environmental               variables, it is possible to use them to reconstruct past                       climatic change.  Also, since tree rings are deposited on an                    annual basis, they permit an accurate dating of this change.                    Drs. Dean and Graybill will add to an already substantial data                  base through the analysis of additional cores from living trees                 in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado.  Their preliminary                  work show a major climatic peturbation at approximately 1300 AD;                this corresponds to a time of major cultural change in the                      Southwest.  The Arizona team will focus their attention on this                 issue.  They will reconstruct changing annual and seasonal                      variations in precipitation, temperature, growing season length,                the Palmer Drought Severity Index, and changes in stream flow.                                                                                                  The Southwestern United States saw the rise, in pre Hispanic                    times, of complex cultures which  covered large portions of                     several states.  These archaeological complexes expanded and                    contracted over time and the largest disintegrated before the                   arrival of the Spanish.  Archaeologists have hypothesized that                  these cultural changes were in fact responses to variation in the               environment and that the Southwest offers an excellent change and               human response.  The tree ring data will significantly aid in                   analyses of this kind.                                                                                                                                          This research will be important not only for archaeologists, but                also paleoecologists and scientists interested in climate                       dynamics and changes.  Changes in temperature and precipitation                 which are of such concern today occurred many times in the past.                It is important both to understand them and to learn how human                  societies responded.",
