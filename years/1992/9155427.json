 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year project, sponsored by the Social Science                        Education Consortium in cooperation with the Science                            Discovery Program at the University of Colorado-Boulder,                        will implement an interdisciplinary science and social                          studies program whose curriculum emphasizes the analysis of                     local community problems, presents an understanding of the                      science issues behind these problems and encourages student                     development of community action projects to help solve                          them.  In the first two years teams from nine school                            districts, selected from the states of Arizona, Colorado                        and New Mexico, consisting of middle school science and                         social science teachers and school administrators, will                         study science and social science content in a four week                         summer session. The teams will carry out inservice projects                     to implement the program during the academic years                              following each summer session.  In the third year two                           resource books for teachers, one for the life science                           curriculum and one for the earth science curriculum, will be                    prepared by the project staff.  The content will be based in                    part on what was found to be successful in the program                          implementation process.                                                                                                                                         Matching funds from the consortium and the school districts                     amount to more than 29% of the NSF grant.",
