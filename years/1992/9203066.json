Morton of the University of California, Riverside,                    will examine the gas phase chemistry of organic cations which                   react via ion-dipole complexes.  The neutral products from the                  reactions of organic cations generated by 70eV electron impact                  will be examined by using an electron bombardment flow reactor.                 This reactor will provide stereochemical information about                      cation rearrangements which will be critical in order to                        understand ion molecule reactions.  Gaseous cations generated                   by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization will also be                       examined.  Ionizations of specific conformations of molecules                   will be studied by slowing down conformational changes through                  rapid cooling by supersonic jet expansion.                                      %%%                                                                             The chemistry of gas phase molecules from which an electron has                 removed will be examined.  The neutral products from these                      reactions will be isolated and identified.  Several molecules                   which can exist in more than one rapidly interconverting                        geometry will also be examined.  These molecules will be cooled                 to stop their interconversions and the chemistry of each                        geometric form of the molecule will be examined.",
