 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitchell plans to continue his investigation of homotopy-                  theoretic aspects of algebraic K-theory, focusing on questions                  related to the Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures for rings of                     algebraic integers.  Goerss will continue his work on unstable                  homotopy theory.  In particular, he plans to pursue Michael                     Barratt's program for analyzing Hopf invariants, to continue an                 ongoing study of Hopf algebras, and to study some of the algebraic              aspects of p-local homotopy theory.  Devinatz' research continues               his study of the generating hypothesis and his exposition of                    Morava's work.  He also plans to examine the consequences of the                telescope conjecture, particularly to Bousfield classes of                      suspension spectra.                                                                  The details of these three parts vary, but all are concerned               either with reducing geometric information to a subject for                     calculation or to perfecting one of the principal algebraic tools               used for this purpose.  The nature of the geometric information                 involved is the crux of the difficulty.  While questions about                  lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to              be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what are known             as topological properties of geometric objects.  These are                      properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),                      knottedness, having no holes, and so forth.  All systematic study               of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric              objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are              only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of                 differences that can occur, all these have only truly been                      comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of             calculation.  Homotopy theory and algebraic K-theory have been                  developed into major tools for this purpose, and the interplay                  between the algebra and the topology involved remains a fascinating             subject.",
