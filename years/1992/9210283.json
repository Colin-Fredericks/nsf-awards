The work is based on previous                          development by the investigator of an optrode that                              utilized a chemical intermediary to detect and monitor                          water solutions of polar organic substances.  In this                           project, the investigator plans to devise an optrode and                        spectroscopic system for both saturated and unsaturated                         (vapor phase) conditions and to determine its potential                         applicability in survey of the movement of groundwater                          pollutants.                                                                                                                                                     The proposal leading to this project was submitted in                           response to NSF 90-121, Research Planning Grants and                            Career Advancement Awards for Women Scientists and                              Engineers.  The proposed work involves the conduct of a                         research planning grant.  It is responsive to the effort                        NSF is making to assist in increasing the number of new                         women investigators participating in NSF's supported                            research programs and to facilitate the conduct of                              preliminary studies and other activities that are likely                        to result in the development of competitive research                            projects by women who have not previously had independent                       Federal research funding.",
