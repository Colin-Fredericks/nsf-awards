 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal lagoon-type estuaries such as the Virginia Coast Reserve                are often nitrogen-limited.  The availability of nitrogen                       controls aquatic primary productivity in the estuary.  The                      effects of N-loading on the estuary due to agricultural runoff                  depends to a large extent upon the N-cycling processes that occur               in the intertidal sediments.  Processes such as nitrification-                  denitrification result in losses of N from the sediment, whereas                dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium tends to conserve N                 in the sediment.  Efforts to develop models to predict the                      effects of nitrogen influx to estuaries due to natural or                       anthropogenic processes have been limited by the difficulties                   involved in measuring the rates of the various N-cycling                        processes in wetland sediments.  Many of the techniques currently               used to measure the rates of these processes are disruptive,                    utilize inhibitors of questionable effectiveness, or require                    additions of substrates at higher than ambient concentrations.                  Such techniques may at best then measure potential rather than                  in-situ reaction rates.                                                                                                                                         This project will develop the methodologies required to apply 15N               isotope pool dilution techniques to intact sediment cores taken                 from vegetated and unvegetated intertidal wetland ecosystems.                   These measurements will allow the determination of the relative                 importance of nitrification, followed by denitrification v.s.                   dissimilatory nitrate reduction to the overall N-budget.                                                                                                        The study will be performed at a Long Term Ecological Research                  site in the Virginia Coast Reserve.  Taken together, this                       information will improve the accuracy of rate estimates of                      nitrogen cycling reactions in wetland and near shore sediments                  and permit an evaluation of the role of these processes in the                  ecology of coastal marine ecosystems.",
