 "awd_abstract_narration": "Informational suppression can be central to genetic analysis and                gene manipulation.  Suppressor-tRNA mutations may be used to define             selectable markers for transformation experiments.  Suppression of              chloroplast gene was first observed in Chlamydamons reinhardtii by              this laboratory.  The photosynthetic mutants which were suppressed              were found to be heteroplastic and it was proposed that a balanced              polymorphism of suppressor and wild type alleles of a tRNA gene                 resulted in the heteroplasmicity.  The hypothesized mechanism is                unique and this study continues the characterization of the system.             The objectives are to determine the nature of the tRNAs involved                and determine the frequency and diversity of heteroplastic                      suppression.                                                                    %%%                                                                             Much has been learned of the physical structure of the chloroplast              genome but little is know of the basic genetic mechanisms utilized              by this organelle.  C. reinhardtii is still the only green                      organisms in which routine genetic analysis of this chloroplast is              possible and the information resulting from this study could have               important economic ramifications.",
