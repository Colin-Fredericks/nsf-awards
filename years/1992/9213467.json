 "awd_abstract_narration": "Habituation is a process by which organisms come to show reduced                response to a stimulus as a function of repeated stimulation.  Once             habituation has taken place, the response remains low over a period             of time, suggesting that the organisms remembers that this stimulus             is the same one it is has encountered previously.  Thus,                        habituation is a simple form of learning.  This award to Dr. Alice              Powers will investigate the neural basis of the blink reflex and                habituation of that reflex.  First the anatomy and physiology of                the reflex will be examined.  Then a study will be conducted                    investigating whether the interval between consecutive stimuli                  affects habituation of the blink reflex.  These studies will                    provide the basis for further work investigating the brain                      mechanisms of habituation and will contribute to understanding of               the way in which the brain mediates learning.***t//",
