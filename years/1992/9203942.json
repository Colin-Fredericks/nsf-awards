 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the development of fast                         algorithms for constraint satisfaction problem.  Constraint                     satisfaction formations are currently used in many ways,                        including the generating test of correctness for electronic                     circuits, the understanding of line drawings by computer, the                   solution of combinatorial problems, and folding of RNA                          molecules.  The set of constraint satisfaction problems is one                  of the NP complete problem sets, so it is unlikely that a fast                  algorithm for all constraint satisfaction problems will ever                    be found.  For several hundred years some of the best                           researchers have been looking for fast algorithms for NP                        complete problems sets, and they have never found an algorithm                  that is fast for every problem in an NP complete set.  None                     the less, algorithms have been found that are fast for most                     problems in certain NP complete problems sets.  This research                   is concerned with sets where the importance of the problems in                  the sets vary as parameters associated with the set are                         varied.  By studying the average running time of particular                     algorithms as the parameters are varied, algorithms that are                    fast under a wide range of conditions can be found.",
