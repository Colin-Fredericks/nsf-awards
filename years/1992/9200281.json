 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although some of the barriers preventing women from entering               science and engineering careers have diminished or disappeared                  over the last several decades, the number of women scientists and               engineers in the United States is still disproportionately small.               Results of the Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)                study establish the technical basis for a new educational tool,                 an interactive Compact Disc - Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) program,                Outlooks, that has as its purpose the introduction of students to               women scientists and scientific careers.  Through audio, photos,                illustrations and text, the prototype imparted to students                      significant and inspiring information:  They were getting to know               top women scientists, to learn about their exciting work on a                   personal basis, and to find out what it takes to become a                       scientist.  The research objectives of the Phase II research                    focus on (1) planning and designing the format, content, and                    technical approach of prototype software; (2) producing Phase II                prototype packages (the CD-ROM and the teacher's guide); and (3)                conducting development, implementation and impact studies.  The                 work will provide a multimedia CD-ROM program highlighting the                  accomplishments of women in science and an audiovisual resource                 for science and career education in an engaging, interactive                    format.",
