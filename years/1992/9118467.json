 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daily biological timekeeping, best reflected in the perception of               lay persons in terms of human \"jet-lag\" or shift-work maladies, is              regulated by a composite interaction of neural pacemaker (SCN) and              environmental synchronizing agents. The pacemaker autonomously                  drives dependent biochemical, physiological and behavioral                      functions with free-running circadian period under constant                     environmental conditions close to but not exactly 24-hours, while               the environmental entraining or synchronizing agent corrects phase              and frequency of the pacemaker to local time. Much mammalian                    circadian research, particularly the physiological aspect, has been             limited to laboratory rats and golden hamsters. In an attempt to                distinguish differences between the circadian \"wiring\" of  diurnal              mammals and better known nocturnal mammals, the study will examine              selected key issues for three diurnal species in successive stages              of circadian function including sensory input from the environment              for entertainment, physiological properties of the SCN rhythm                   generator, and behavioral output.                                                                                                                               Physiological and behavioral circadian output measurements will be              employed in these three diurnal rodents to clarify circadian                    regulation in day-active mammals. The antelope ground squirrel, 13-             lined ground squirrel, and eastern chipmunk were chosen as model                species to minimize operational problems that have long hindered                progress of research on circadian behavioral function in diurnal                mammals, and also to assess circadian variation span in                         ecologically widely divergent desert, prairie, and forest species.              Issues will include the light-sampling process for entrainment in               lab and field, the role of environmental temperature as well as                 cyclic body temperature in circadian function, and the delineation              of a \"light-mimicking\" phase response curve system (PRC) by use of              intraventricular injection of carbachol; the distribution of key                SCN neuropepetides (NP-II, VIP, SS, NPY) will be determined by                  immunocytochemical methods plus computerized image processing for               quantitative determination of co-localized immunoreactivity.                    Finally, in vitro and in vivo recording of SCN rhythmic output                  relative to other brain areas will also be investigated. The data               may serve as a useful model for better understanding the                        functioning of diurnal circadian systems of mammals, and more                   generally for envisioning the means by which the relatively simple              neuronal circuitry of the SCN is able to control contrasting                    nocturnal and diurnal circadian behavior modes.",
