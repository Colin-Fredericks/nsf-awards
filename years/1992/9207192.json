 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Ecological community is usually defined as an assemblage of                  species in a given habitat, with trophic interactions among these               species represented by a static food web.  Most communities,                    however are not isolated from the effects of species in adjacent                habitats and individuals can change their position in the food                  web or move between habitats as they change body size.  This                    award focuses on interactions that take place across habitat                    boundaries, using observations of natural populations,                          experimental manipulation of habitat boundaries, and experiments                in artificial habitats to estimate the importance of interactions               between members of stream and wooodland communities.  The study                 focuses on resources of salamanders and on interactions among                   salamander populations and it tests ecological theories on the                  maintenance of complex life cycles and models interactions                      between size-structured populations as well as the role of                      interactions between communities in landscape ecology.  The study               of interactions among species at habitat boundaries is important                to understanding the consequences of habitat fragmentation that                 results from shifting land use patterns.",
