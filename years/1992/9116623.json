 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a           U.S.-Japan Seminar on Surface Characterization by Electron                      Diffraction, REM, and Holography, to be held March 15-18, 1993                  in Honolulu.  The co-organizers are Professor Philip I. Cohen,                  Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota,                  and Professor Ayahiko Ichimiya, Department of Applied Physics,                  Nagoya University.  The objective of this seminar is to bring                   together recent advances in electron probes of surface structures               important to the nucleation and growth of thin films.  The electron             probes to be emphasized have similar analyses, with many of the                 participants involved in more than one aspect.  The participants are            from several fields, including electron microscopy, surface science,            and epitaxial growth.  This seminar should enhance significantly                the interactions between U.S. and Japanese scientists using new                 electron probes of new materials, improve their understanding of                these probes, and develop the technology for the growth of these                new thin film materials.",
