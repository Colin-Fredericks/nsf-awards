Other U.S. investigators involved in               the project are from the University of Wisconsin, Oak Ridge                     National Laboratory, the National Institute for Standards and                   Technology, and Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Other Japanese                 investigators are from Osaka University, Yokohama National                      University, Iwate University, and Nihon University.                                                                                                             The project will focus on three important areas of research on                  superconducting magnet technology:  (1) engineering issues on                   high-Tc superconductor magnet technology, emphasizing and                       incorporating the requirements of fabricability, windability,                   stability, protection, and operating temperature; (2) thermal                   stability and protection for high-Tc magnet systems; and (3) AC                 losses in high-Tc superconductors.  The U.S. and Japanese                       research groups will share their unique facilities to collaborate in            both experimental and analytical studies in these important areas.",
