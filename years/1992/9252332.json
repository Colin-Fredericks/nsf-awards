 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laboratory for Training Pre-College Physics Teachers The                        Simulation/Interactive Video Physics Laboratory consists of a                   six computer workstations equipped with a laserdisc player and                  associated color monitor.  This laboratory forms an integral                    part of the one semester course Physical Science (taken by                      elementary education majors) and the two semester course                        sequence Physics 1 and Physics 2 (taken by secondary education                  science majors).  The purpose of the project is to enhance                      student understanding of basic physics through the use of a                     planned sequence of student centered activities.  The                           simulation/video lab forms part of a larger project which                       includes a separate computer-based physics lab in which                         students are able to use equipment interfaced to a computer to                  acquire and display data in real-time and then to manipulate                    the data both visually and numerically.  In the proposed                        simulation/video lab, students at each computer workstation                     have available a complete array of physics simulation software,                 The Physics Explorer, with which they are able to investigate                   the full range of physical phenomena normally studied in                        introductory physics courses.  In addition, each student has a                  comprehensive package of interactive video software based on                    the Mechanical Universe.  Upon completion of the project, the                   courses Physical Science, Physics 1, and Physics 2 will have                    undergone a complete transformation from traditionally taught                   elementary physics courses to courses based on student centered                 data acquisition, simulation, and interactive video activities.",
