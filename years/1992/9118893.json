 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research tests the Muller's ratchet hypothesis                which concerns the evolution of dimorphic sex chromosomes.  The                 distinctive organization of the X and Y sex chromosomes is                      responsible for sex-specific differences in the expression of                   many forms of hereditary disease.  The X sex chromosome also                    appears to play a particularly important role in the process of                 adaptation, due to: 1) an enhanced level of expression of                       recessive, beneficial mutations, and 2) a form of sex specific                  gene expression for traits associated with sexual dimorphism.                        The proposed research will extend previous work which has                  demonstrated that the Muller's ratchet process can be effectively               studied in the laboratory using a Drosophila melanogaster (common               fruit fly) model system.  The factors that affect the operation                 of the Muller's ratchet process are:  mutation, selection,                      sampling error, and recombination.  These factors also determine                the size of the reservoir of disease-causing mutation that are                  maintained in human and other populations.  The proposed research               will permit us to better understand the dynamics of our own                     reservoir of deleterious mutations.                                                  The research used a D. melanogaster model system to                        study the rate of operation of the Muller's ratchet process in                  response to manipulative changes in its major parameters; the                   effective population size, and the presence/absence of                          recombination.  This is accomplished by constructing giant                      chromosomes that are forced to segregate like either a primitive                X (recombining) or Y (non-recombining) sex chromosomes and then                 measuring the rate of accumulation of deleterious mutations.",
