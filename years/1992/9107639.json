The agriculture and forestry industries produce                                 large amounts of waste and by-products                                          containing cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin,                                 which can be thermally decomposed into valuable                                 chemicals and/or charcoal.  This project aims                                   to find out how to influence the decomposition                                  process in order to get higher amounts of the                                   valuable byproducts.  This research will                                        identify 1) how the various components of                                       biomass contribute to the formation of charcoal                                 during pyrolysis at normal pressure in a                                        flowing gas environment, 2) how the increase of                                 pressure and the presence of the formed gaseous                                 products influence charcoal yield in a stagnant                                 gaseous environment, 3) how biomass composition                                 influences charcoal yield at elevated pressures                                 in a stagnant gaseous environment, 4) what are                                  the kinetics and the heat demand of the                                         reaction at elevated pressures in a stagnant                                    gaseous environment.                                                                                                                                            This project in inorganic chemistry fulfills                                    the program objective of advancing scientific                                   knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                    United States and Eastern Europe to combine                                     complementary talents and pool research                                         resources in areas of strong mutual interest                                    and competence.",
