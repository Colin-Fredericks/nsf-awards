 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major challenge in neural network research is to build models               that are simple enough for analysis but describe the biological                 behavior of the network and can be tested experimentally.  Recent               experimental and theoretical studies of small neural networks                   make the building of such models possible.  In the proposed                     research we will build a detailed biological model of the pyloric               Central Pattern Generator of the lobster.  This model will be an                extended version of the Hodgkin-Huxley model which includes the                 important currents and synaptic connections.  Using methods from                dynamical system theory and physical approximation we will obtain               a simpler model which still describes the experimental results.                 A phase model will be developed from the full model.  The effects               of synaptic modification and changes of intrinsic properties of                 the neurons will be tested, and the effect of neurotransmitters                 will be investigated.  The theoretical study will combine                       analytical and numerical methods from neural network and                        dynamical system theory, numerical simulations and will be                      compared to neurobiological experiments.  The research will                     contribute to bridging the gap between regular neural network                   models and the biological reality.",
