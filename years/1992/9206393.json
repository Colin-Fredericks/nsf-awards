 "awd_abstract_narration": "Li will study the discrete spectrum of the restriction of                  the oscillator representation to reductive dual pairs.  He will                 relate this investigation to the study of the discrete series of                generalized Stiefel manifolds.  The wave front sets and                         asymptotic distributions of discrete series will play a vital                   role.  The results will be applied to the construction of unitary               automorphic forms on classical groups, including those with non-                zero cohomology.  They will also be used to construct elements of               the Rammanujan Dual.                                                                 The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                   twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                 exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                             representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                   upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                    theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                        mechanics and elementary particle physics.",
