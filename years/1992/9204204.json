Recombination will be monitored by                     detecting fast moving neutral products. This will permit                        production of solvent-separated ion pair clusters, and will                     lead to elucidation of step-wise solvation energies of strong                   electrolytes.%%%                                                                Reactions of charged species in solution lie at the heart of                    many chemical reactions, but very little hard information has                   been available about the detailed role of intervening solvent                   in influencing the course of the reaction. Prof. Coe (Ohio                      State University) will address this question by building an                     apparatus which will make it possible for the first time to                     determine how many solvent molecules there must be around the                   reacting species in order to keep positively charged materials                  from reacting immediately with negatively charged species. This                 will help to answer the more general question of how many                       molecules are needed to define what chemists mean by a solution                 of one substance in another.",
