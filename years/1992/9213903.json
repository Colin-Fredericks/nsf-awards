The                                  sessions are entitled: Design and Integration                                   Issues in Electronics Manufacturing Technology;                                 Process Technology Planning, Design, and                                        Integration in Large Scale Manufacturing,                                       Expert System Design for Manufacturing Control,                                 and Product Modeling Systems that Capture                                       Design and Manufacturing Information.  Subjects                                 to be addressed include: concurrent or                                          simultaneous engineering; design theory; design                                 for feasibility in manufacture, assembly, and                                   inspection; and planning and control issues in                                  modern manufacturing.                                                                                                                                           The meeting will bring together key researchers                                 in design and automated manufacturing from                                      industry, national agencies and universities in                                 Africa and the U.S., to share ideas on the                                      practicalities of the new advanced design and                                   manufacturing technologies.   The conference                                    promises mutual benefit to the U.S. and African                                 engineers by exposing the participants to new                                   perspectives on both problems and solutions in                                  industrial development.  This project is                                        relevant to the objectives of the Science in                                    Developing Countries (SDC) Program with regard                                  to strengthening the scientific and engineering                                 infrastructure in developing countries, and                                     increasing the level of cooperation between                                     U.S. scientists and engineers and their                                         counterparts in developing countries.",
