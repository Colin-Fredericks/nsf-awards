 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most organisms live in worlds that are spatially                           structured.  The purpose of this grant is to use dynamic, state                 variable models (which couple environmental and physiological                   parameters in a consistent manner) to study spatial and multi-                  trophic level aspects of insect-plant and host-parasitoid                       interactions.  In the course of this work, three main goals will                be achieved.  First, the methodology of dynamic state variable                  modeling will be extended to include spatial structure.  Second,                such extended models will be used to determine how the                          descriptions of how populations change over space or time arise                 from individual behavior.  Third, the predictions of the theory                 will be tested using a three trophic level system consisting of a               plant, a fruit fly that attacks the seeds of the plant, and a                   wasp that attacks the fruit fly.  The experimental system chosen                uses a fly that is closely related to the apple maggot fly, so                  that insights learned in this work may have important applied                   implications in pest control.  The combination of experiment and                theory is ideal for the development of new and important insights               into behavioral evolutionary ecology.",
