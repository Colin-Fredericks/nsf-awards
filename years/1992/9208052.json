 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two investigators are involved in this project.  James F.                  Davis' main emphasis is the use of surgery theory to study rational             information in manifold theory.  Surgery theory is the main tool                for classification of manifolds of dimension greater than 3,                    although complexities in homotopy and integral representation                   theory make it efficacious only in special cases.  However, if one              works over the rational numbers, complete results are available for             manifolds with finite fundamental group.  Davis will attempt                    extensions of these results to manifolds with infinite fundamental              group, and to spaces more general than manifolds, but which still               possess some form of duality.  A second and quite different                     direction of Davis' research is knot theory.  He will study the                 homology of covers of the 3-sphere branched over a knot, the set of             periods of a knot, and their relationship with algebraic number                 theory.  In related work, Kent E. Orr will continue to study                    linking and knotting phenomena in codimension two, as well as                   investigate the implications of the recent Cochran-Orr work to                  Casson-Gordon invariants and four-dimensional surgery.  Among other             things, he hopes to answer the following two questions about the                link slice problem:  Are all even-dimensional links slice?  Do the              presently known homotopy theoretic linking invariants of links in               the 3-sphere (such as the transfinite invariants of Levine and Orr              and the Le Dimet invariant) reduce to classically defined                       invariants such as Milnor's invariants and Massy products?                           The details of these parts vary, but all are concerned with                reducing geometric information to a subject for calculation or to               perfecting the algebraic machinery used for the calculations.  The              nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of the                 difficulty.  While questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes,             and so forth virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is             far different with what are known as topological properties of                  geometric objects.  These are properties such as connectedness                  (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so                  forth.  All systematic study of such properties, for example, how               to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to               one of these properties or are only superficially different, or how             to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all these                have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they have been              reduced to matters of calculation, and two of the principal tools               for this are homotopy theory and surgery theory.",
