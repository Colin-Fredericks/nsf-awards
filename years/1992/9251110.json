 "awd_abstract_narration": "TechniquesOakland University is expanding existing student                      facilities for robotics and manufacturing to create a                           laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Manufacturing.                   Specific hardware acquisitions include a computer workstation                   with two terminals to support AI development, and two PC-based                  stations with appropriate data acquisition and control hardware                 to support AI delivery.  Software acquisitions include AI tools                 for knowledge representation and expert systems (largely                        contributed by The Carnegie Group, Inc.), object-oriented                       modeling software for a wide range of manufacturing problems,                   and necessary support software.  These additions permit                         students to examine the intelligent use and integration of                      current equipment including a CNC mill, a CNC lathe, a vision                   system, a robotic manipulator and a CAD/CAM system.This                         laboratory primarily supports a new course entitled Improving                   Manufacturing with Artificial Intelligence Techniques but the                   improvements also benefit existing courses including Artificial                 Intelligence and Intelligent Robotics.  Students will learn:                    1) to use expert system shells to build diagnostic expert                       systems for maintaining the lab's devices;  2) to implement                     neural network algorithms to control machines;  3) to extract                   features that control a manufacturing device or cell using                      various learning algorithms;  4) to build hypertext procedure                   descriptions for the use of manufacturing systems;  and 5) to                   use object-oriented models of manufactured goods, and to apply                  other AI techniques to the problems of manufacturing.  The lab                  will be one of the first designed to train students in the use                  of AI techniques to improve existing manufacturing technologies                 and help generate new ones.",
