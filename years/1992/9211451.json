 "awd_abstract_narration": "The decision-making of the United States Supreme Court is of                    substantial interest to social scientists, journalists, and                     laypersons alike.  Beginning in 1983, the Law and Social Science                Program provided support for the construction of a multi-user data              base that codifies a wide range of dimensions relevant to Supreme               Court decision-making, and makes these data available to social                 scientists and other parties through the Interuniversity Consortium             for Political and Social Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  This                 grant will extend the data base and therefore, enhance scholarship              on the Supreme Court.                                                                                                                                           Specifically, this collaborative project with Harold Spaeth, the                principal investigator of the original project, will extend the                 NSF-funded U.S. Supreme Court Judicial Data Base (now covering the              Warren, Burger and Rehnquist years) to encompass comparable data                on the official votes of the Vinson Court (1946-1953).  A second                extension integrates data related to the official votes with a data             base created by Jan Palmer that contains the justices' conference               voting and opinion assignments.  This data base, which encompasses              the Vinson Court, will be extended to include the Warren Court.                 The resulting project will span 23 terms of the Supreme Court                   (1946-1968) and the behavior of the 20 justices who then served.                As with the original data base, these extensions will be archived               at the Inter-University Consortium, and will be available as an                 SPSS export file.  The richness of the resulting data will                      tremendously enhance the formulation of theory and testing of                   hypotheses with respect to the Supreme Court.",
