 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a sabbatical visit by                   Professor G. Sathyanarayanan of Lehigh University to the                        Technical University of Berlin, Germany, to collaborate in                      manufacturing engineering research with Professor Gunter Spur and               others of that University and the nearby Fraunhofer Institute for               Production Systems Engineering and Design Technology.  The                      participating universities have longstanding research programs                  focused on the grinding of structural ceramics that will benefit from           the stronger linkage established through this sabbatical visit.  The            proposed joint research will evaluate the effect of vibratory                   grinding on the rate of removal of ceramic material as well as the              strength and surface integrity of the ground ceramics.  The results             will be used to develop a model of vibratory grinding as a                      prerequisite to controlling the process in a manufacturing setting.                                                                                             Structural ceramic materials possess extraordinary characteristics of           hardness, strength and resistance to heat, wear and corrosion.                  However, the same characteristics make them difficult to be                     shaped.  Machining flaws have been identified to be the major                   contributor in degrading the strength of structural ceramics.  These            flaws are most often cracks that are introduced during the grinding             operation.  While many of these flaws can be removed by                         secondary finishing, this adds to the production cost.  New                     effective methods such as vibratory grinding are needed to produce              finished structural ceramics that are competitive with metal                    components.  The fundamental goal of this collaboration is to                   establish the necessary manufacturing science base for ceramic                  grinding, and thereby to enhance U.S. competitiveness in the                    finishing of structural ceramics.",
