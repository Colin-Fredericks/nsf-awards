This conference serves as the principal                           international forum for reporting advances in the                               development and applications of optical fiber                                   sensors, guided wave optical sensors, and the                                   underlying fundamental technologies and                                         components.  Optical fiber sensors have important                               applications to many commercial technology areas,                               such as in industrial control, building structures,                             avionics and medicine.  The increasing diversity of                             applications of this sensor technology is the main                              impetus for this request of conference support from                             the IEEE.  Funds are sought to provide partial                                  support for travel and conference expenses of                                   graduate students and faculty who may be relatively                             new to the field.",
