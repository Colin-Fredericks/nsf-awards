 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will focus on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by              which the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus responds to changes             in environmental salinity. This species, like many others, is known             to accumulate high intracellular concentrations of proline, a non-              essential amino acid. The mechanisms regulating proline synthesis               in response to osmotic stress in higher organisms remain to be                  determined. Previous work has shown that one regulatory site for                induction of proline synthesis lies within the first two steps of               the pathway between glutamate and proline; the current work will                concentrate on this pathway. The goals of the proposed work are to              elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation and               to determine why such regulation fails among some interpopulation               hybrids.                                                                        Primary objectives are: (1) to isolate (clone) the genes encoding               the first two enzymes in the proline synthesis pathway, (2) to                  determine the normal pattern of regulation of these genes during                osmotic response, (3) to screen interpopulation hybrid lines for                aberrant regulation of proline synthesis at the biochemical level,              and (4) to use the cloned genes as probes for determining the                   mechanism underlying hybrid breakdown in proline synthesis.",
