 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pitutary gonadotropin hormones, luteinizing hormone (LH) and                follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), play an essential role in                   mammalian development and normal reproductive function.  These two              gonadotropin hormones are composed of two subunits, a common                    alpha-subunit and a beta-subunit which is unique and confers                    specificity.  Dr. Attardi has demonstrated that gonadotropin                    releasing hormone, a hormone found in the hypothalamus of the                   brain, and the gonadal hormones, inhibin, activin and follistatin,              cause rapid and profound effects on the synthesis of FSH but not                LH.  These changes are mediated through alternation in the                      messenger RNA which codes for the beta-subunit of the FSH protein.              Dr. Attardi will examine whether these effects result from changes              in synthesis rate of messanger RNA for FSH beta-subunit or from                 changes in stability of the FSH beta-subunit molecules.  The                    results from these studies will help elucidate how hypothalamic and             gonadal hormones regulate gonadotropin synthesis and secretion.                 This will increase our understanding of how pituitary cells                     communicate among themselves as well as with hypothalamic neurons               and cells in the ovaries and testes.  Moreover, the results could               lead to the development of safer and more effective methods of                  fertility control and increased ability to diagnose and treat                   problems of infertility.",
