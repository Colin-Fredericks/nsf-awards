 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at the                   University of Massachusetts at Boston to give ten undergraduate                 students the opportunity to participate in research projects in                 ecology and conservation biology.  Students will be recruited                   intensively in the Boston area and also elsewhere in New England.               The two major components of the program are complementary:  1) a                series of lectures/discussions for all the students, and 2)                     individual research projects in which each student is closely                   associated with an advisor/mentor.                                                                                                                              Initial group meetings that address the theory and practice of                  research continue as weekly meetings at which students focus on                 topics that relate to the conduct of research or its implications.              Students will also visit one or more field sites and learn directly             about each others' projects.  A small hands-on workshop on                      molecular techniques will show the great potential of such methods              for ecology.  An end-of-session retreat at the University Field                 Station will serve to articulate impressions and explore                        philosophical issues.                                                                                                                                           Seven potential research topics will be suggested, some of which                can effectively involve two or more undergraduates.  The topics are             focussed on issues of biodiversity and conservation ecology but are             intentionally diverse to illustrate several approaches.  They                   include three on the behavioral ecology of rare/endangered                      vertebrates, and others on the physiological ecology of hawkmoths,              the diversity of naphthalene-degrading bacteria, the genetics of                endangered plants, and the genetic diversity of deep-sea molluses.              At the end of the session each student will prepare a written                   report and present a short paper in a mini-conference.",
