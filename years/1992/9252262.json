 "awd_abstract_narration": "A microcomputer mathematics laboratory is being established                    for use in courses for the first two years of college                           mathematics.  Students are working with computer investigations                 of mathematics concepts in a laboratory situation.  These                       investigations include the construction of mathematical                         processes and objects on a computer, the use of symbolic                        manipulation, and the use of graphics to foster cognitive                       development of understandings of mathematical ideas and                         concepts.  In addition, an appropriate cooperative learning                     component for the laboratory and classroom settings is being                    developed. Research into how students learn mathematics, and                    into their attitudes about mathematics and the learning of                      mathematics is being conducted in this setting.  Investigations                 are also being conducted into how the use of computer                           technology and an appropriate cooperative learning environment                  can enhance the learning of mathematics for a non-traditional                   population.",
