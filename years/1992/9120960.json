 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposal is to study the dietary                  choices demonstrated by an ape (the chimpanzee) and several                     congeneric species of monkeys in the Kibale Forest of Uganda.                   Physical anthropologists have for many years debated the reasons                for the grater success of monkeys relative to apes since the                    Miocene and the clear diminution in the number of species of ape.               Wrangham has hypothesized that the success of the monkeys has been              due to their ability to process secondary compounds in vegetation               more effectively than apes.  These compounds are a variety of                   toxins which limit the food choices of animals unable to detoxify               and digest them.  Confirmation of this hypothesis will be advanced              by observation of the food choices of the two primates during a                 synchronous study.                                                                                                                                              In this study the investigators will observe the food choices of                the study species during feeding in order to quantify the dietary               intake.  In addition samples of the foods will be gathered for                  laboratory analysis.  The data will then be analyzed for food                   choices and composition and the used to clarify the habitat                     utilization by this ape and the three monkey species.",
