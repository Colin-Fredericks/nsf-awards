 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current nomenclatural framework for the type Cincinnatian              suggests an underlying lithostratigraphic complexity that inhibits              utilization of its rich fossil biota for paleoecological and                    macroevolutionary investigations.  However, several recent studies              indicate that this apparent complexity is partly an artifact of                 difficulties with the nomenclature itself.  The purpose of the                  research is to develop a high-resolution chronostratigraphic                    framework for the Kope through Corryville Formations (Edenian-                  Maysvillian) in the Cincinnati region that transcends stratigraphic             nomenclature through the use of event horizons for correlation,                 including:  transgressive surfaces, epiboles, earthquake-disrupted              beds, storm beds with unusual sedimentological features, and sea                level-associated stratigraphic \"spikes\" in lithologic and faunal                characteristics.   A series of field localities and cores from                  throughout the region will be measured and described in detail, and             faunal samples collected and analyzed, to delineate event horizons              within the study interval.  Previous investigations indicate the                presence of several such horizons, and it is anticipated that our               work designed specifically for this purpose, will permit the                    recognition of several more.  The result will be a series of cross-             sections and maps illustrating a chronostratigraphic framework for              the sequence.  As a first use of this framework, we will conduct a              series of gradient analyses on documented event horizons to                     calibrate the degree of lateral variability in paleoenvironments                and paleocommunities at specific times during the Edenian and                   Maysvillian stages.",
