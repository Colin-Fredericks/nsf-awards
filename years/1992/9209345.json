 "awd_abstract_narration": "A partitionable parallel architecture allows the simultaneous               execution of a number of tasks, where each task can be executed on a            number of processors.  This model introduces the problem of how many            processors to allocate to each task.  The processor allocation                  process must (1) determine the number of processors required to                 process each task and (2) allocate and schedule these tasks on the              processors in the system.  The objective is to minimize the time to             complete all the tasks.  In most cases at the current time, the number          of processors assigned to each task is determined manually thereby              leading to under-utilization of the processors.  This project                   considers the design of efficient processor allocation algorithms for           a large class of partitionable parallel architectures.  The                     conventional scheduling problems, where each job runs on one                    processor, differ significantly from the processor allocation problem           and thus their solutions cannot be expected to perform adequately for           this processor allocation problem.  The objectives of this project are          to study the processor allocation problem, under different computation          and architecture models, and design and evaluate algorithms for                 processor assignment and processor scheduling.  These algorithms are            tested, through both a simulation and their application to real                 problems.  The performance gains made by the algorithms, and the                overheads incurred by the operating system, are measured through                experiments performed on different parallel architectures.  The                 results from this research are expected to provide a definite step              forward in understanding resource allocation and scheduling problems            in partitionable architectures, and consequently lead to a better               utilization of parallel architectures.",
