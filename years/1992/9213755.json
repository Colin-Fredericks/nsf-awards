 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electronic structure calculations grounded in the Hohenberg-Kohn-               Sham density functional theory predict what atoms, molecules, and               solids can exist, and with what properties.  The accuracy of these              predictions depends on the accuracy of the functionals or rules                 used to construct the energy from the electron density.  Goals of               this theoretical research are: (1) to develop, from first                       principles, more accurate exchange correlation and kinetic energy               functionals of the local spin density and generalized gradient                  types; (2) to apply generalized gradient approximations in                      calculations of measurable proerties such as the electron spin                  density at the nucleus of an atom or the energy of a metallic                   surface; (3) to understand the capabilities and limitations of                  these approximations in light of radical nonlocality of the exact               exchange correlation potential; (4) to refine and test fully                    nonlocal functionals such as the self-interaction correction or the             weighted density approximation; (5) to construct local                          pseudopotentials describing effective interactions between valence              electrons and ionic cores in metals using only the equilibrium                  density, the valence, and a \"smoothness\" condition; (6) to study                size effects in metals.                                                         %%%                                                                             Theoretical research will be conducted on the foundations of one of             the major techniques currently used to determine the properties of              atoms, molecules and solids.  The results of this work will                     reinforce the fundamentals of density functional theory and provide             guidance for new directions for its computational implementation.",
