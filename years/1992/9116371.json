 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an airborne field investigation of the physical                 characteristics of leads in arctic sea ice using a lidar and multi-             frequency radiometers to remotely probe the ice surface, as well                as of the emission of dimethylsulfide (DMS) from the ocean of its               effects on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), the structure and                   radiative properties of arctic haze and stratus clouds.  The                    project will make use of an instrumented C-131 aircraft owned by                the University of Washington, and will be a component of the Arctic             Lead Dynamics Experiment (LEADEX) and the Arctic Gas and Aerosol                Sampling Program (AGASP-IV).                                                                                                                                    Although leads, or areas of open water in the sea ice cover,                    account for only a few percent of the Arctic Ocean, they play a                 major role in the turbulent transfer of heat to the atmosphere, and             in the transfer of volatile biogenic material.  This project will               concentrate on the flux of oceanic DMS, which is an important                   contributor to the atmospheric sulfur budget and, through oxidation             to sulfur dioxide and sulfates, is a primary source of cloud                    condensation nuclei in the marine atmosphere.                                                                                                                   The principal investigator will also study the effect of DMS on                 arctic haze, which is an atmospheric phenomenon considered to be                important in a variety of arctic processes.  It affects the                     radiation budget directly by modifying the albedo and the thermal               infra-red flux at cloud top levels, and indirectly through the                  modulation effect on cloud radiative properties by cloud                        condensation nuclei.  If it can be shown that local Cloud                       Condensation Nuclei concentrations depend upon DMS emissions, it                may be possible to identify a biological control of the arctic                  marine stratus albedo.  It may also be that deposited trace                     elements from arctic haze contribute significant fluxes of                      contaminants to sensitive arctic ecosystems.",
