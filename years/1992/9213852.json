 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interactions between atmospheric eddy dynamics and other                   physical processes (radiation, convection, surface fluxes, etc.)                play a significant role in the energy and water cycles that                     maintain the extratropical temperature and moisture distributions               of the troposphere.  These interactions thus play a significant                 role in short-term climate variability, but our understanding of                how they work is incomplete.                                                         Dr. Branscome and his collaborators will conduct a series of               numerical experiments designed to study the evolution of feedbacks              in the extratropical atmosphere among transient eddies, moisture,               surface fluxes, and radiation through the temperature and moisture              distributions which are, in turn, maintained by the eddies.  The                time scales under consideration are periods of several days to                  several months.  With this study, the PIs are building on their                 series of results from studies of the interactions between                      baroclinic eddies.  Under the last grant, they looked at the effect             of moisture.  With this award, they will explore the radiative                  effect.  This research is an important part of current efforts to               better understand, and eventually predict, short-term climate.                       This grant consists of two awards which are being made to                  separate institutions for a collaborative effort.  The other award              is ATM-9123552 to Dr. Gutowski of Iowa State University.",
