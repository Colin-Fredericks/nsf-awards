 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of animal species are known to travel in organized                   formations, such as fish schools and the V-shaped formations of                 migrating geese.  It is believed that moving in such formation may              allow energy conservation during swimming or flying.  This would                benefit individual animals in the group by allowing them to travel              at higher speeds or over longer distances than if they traveled                 alone.   A similar situation is observed for human cyclists or race             cars which use a technique called \"drafting\" to increase fuel                   economy and overall speed.  Past attempts to measure such benefits              for animal formations have met with limited success, because the                size and complexity of animal formations has prevented researchers              from directly measuring any energy economy derived from formation               travel.                                                                           This project will attempt to measure energy economy by formation              swimming in mallard ducklings.  The advantages of studying                      ducklings are that ducklings swim in a simple, straight line                    formation, and the formation is small enough to be easily studied               in the laboratory.  Groups of imprinted ducklings will be trained               to swim at various speeds in a water channel while following a                  decoy.  Comparisons of energy expenditure per animal will be made               by manipulating group size, presence or absence of decoy, and age               of ducklings.  The metabolic rate, measured from oxygen                         consumption, will indicate any energy economy by swimming in                    formation.  Simultaneously, video recordings will be made to detail             the paddling motions of the ducklings.  Analysis of these motions               can be used with a hydrodynamic model to compute the energy                     expended during swimming and to determine if particular positions               in a formation provide energy economy.  In addition, experiments                will be conducted in which a dye injected into the water around the             ducklings will show the pattern of water flow. This can provide                 insight into the physical causes for increased energy economy.                  The results of this study will provide empirical data as to the                 extent of energy that can be saved as animals move in formation.",
