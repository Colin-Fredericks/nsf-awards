 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four specific topics will be covered in this research.  (1)                     Axiomatic models of choice in the face of unforeseen contingencies              will be developed, with emphasis given to models of dynamic choice              and choice in multiperson settings.  The objective would be to                  establish axioms that represent rational preferences when the                   decisionmaker is unsure of what future contingencies are even                   possible, much less which will occur.  (2) Efficient contractual                forms in the presence of unforeseen contingencies will be analyzed,             emphasizing how bilateral, relational contracts will change with                changes in the knowledge the parties have about each other's                    preferences and future contingencies.                                                                                                                           (3) The impact of unforeseen contingencies on liability insurance               will be studied, emphasizing the second best form of liability                  insurance in the face of limited liability laws.  (4) The creation              of a notion of similarity between different situations through the              use of cheap talk will be investigated, where one party simply                  declares one situation to be similar to others.  The questions are              when such declarations will be credible and whether such a                      situation can arise naturally through a heuristic learning process.                                                                                             An important general theme of this research, more apparent in the               first three topics than in the fourth, is how individuals adapt and             equilibria are constructed in contexts where the individuals are                constantly confronted with situations that their earlier plans did              not anticipate.  This is a hallmark of global, as well as more                  local, change; how do individuals, economies, and societies adapt               to an environment in which the rules and conditions are always                  changing?  How, for example, should we proceed in the face of the               greenhouse effect, where there is honest controversy as to what the             eventual consequences of various actions (or inactions) will be?                How should national economies construct their trade relations, a                context in which there are clear choices to be made between                     bilateral and tri- or multi-lateral contracting forms, and the                  different countries are constantly working out the nature of their              relationships in the face of changing conditions?  Some of the                  tools developed and the paradigmatic forms of research employed in              this project will be useful in providing answers to specific                    questions such as those posed above.",
