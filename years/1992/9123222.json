 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Giovanni De Micheli of                                  Stanford University to collaborate in computer                                  science research with Dr. Raul Camposano of the                                 German National Research Center for Computer                                    Science (GMD) in Sankt Agustin, Germany.  They                                  are linking their research efforts in the                                       process of transforming high level, behavioral                                  descriptions of digital hardware into logic-                                    level specifications.  In particular, they plan                                 to enhance the front-end of the \"Olympus\"                                       synthesis system, developed at Stanford, by                                     providing a VHDL input, as well as a synthesis                                  policy for VHDL.  This effort will benefit                                      tremendously from Dr. Camposano's experience                                    with VHDL models; he will take primary                                          responsibility for this part of the project.                                    Both of them will work on more efficient                                        algorithms for constraint-based synthesis of                                    concurrent hardware, such as the scheduling                                     problem for large scale circuits, where well                                    known techniques are inefficient.  They also                                    plan to work separately but cooperatively on                                    hardware designs, with the goal of synthesizing                                 four to six real designs between the two sites.                                                                                                                 This proposal joins the efforts of two well-                                    respected researchers in the design automation                                  community in a project that can have significant                                impact on progress in electronic system design.                                 The enhancement to the Stanford Olympus                                         synthesis system will make it available to the                                  mainstream of electronic system designers.                                      Improving algorithms for constraint-based                                       synthesis will result in more efficient ways to                                 design systems.",
