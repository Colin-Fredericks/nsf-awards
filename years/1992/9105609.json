 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to investigate events that occur in              the cytosol of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae prior to or                   during the import of proteins into mitochondria.  Emphasis is                   placed on interactions between mitochondrial precursor proteins and             cytosolic components.  Such components will be identified and their             function in the import process assessed.  The influence of                      cytosolic factors on precursor conformation will be analyzed.                   Experiments will be performed to determine if precursor proteins                fold tightly in the cytosol subsequent to their synthesis in the                cell or are either prevented from folding or actively unfolded                  prior to the import reaction.  Experiments will also be conducted               to evaluate the overall importance of a cotranslational import                  mechanism and to determine if precursor synthesis and import are                coupled in vivo.  To achieve these goals, S. cerevisiae will be                 used to perform both in vitro and in vivo experiments.  A                       completely homologous yeast in vitro import system that has been                recently developed will be a fundamental component of the approach.             Since both the cytosolic extract required for in vitro precursor                synthesis and mitochondria are isolated from the same type of cell,             interactions between these two cellular components can be studied               and the results more directly applied to the situation in vivo.                                                                                                 The mitochondrion, a vital organellar component of the eukaryotic               cell, is made up of proteins from two genomic sources:  some of                 mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the mitochondrion's own DNA               and synthesized by its own transcriptional and translational                    machinery, while others are encoded by the nuclear genome and                   synthesized by the cytoplasmic translational machinery.  The                    question of how these proteins get from their sites of synthesis                to their functional locations in the mitochondrion is an important              and widely-studied one.  The two aspects of the problem addressed               in this proposal, namely (1) whether or not cytosolic factors are               involved in the import of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins                into the mitochondria, and (2) whether or not some proteins are                 translocated into the mitochondria co-translationally, that is,                 while they are still being synthesized, as opposed to post-                     translationally, that is, after the synthesis of the protein is                 completed, are important, somewhat controversial, and timely.  It               is anticipated that these studies will lead to fundamental new                  insights into the mechanism of mitochondrial biogenesis.",
