 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently Doedel and the investigator have developed an                     accurate, robust, and systematic method for computing branches of               heteroclinic orbits for a system of autonomous ordinary                         differential equations in the case that the solution approaches                 the fixed points exponentially, and they implemented the method                 in the software package AUTO.  In this project the investigator                 extends the above results in several directions: 1) developing                  higher order approximation of the unstable and stable manifolds,                which is especially useful in the case when during the                          continuation process the exponential rate of decay is lost, i.e.                a center manifold appears; 2) considering several problems with                 bifurcations of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, including the               case of center manifolds, 3) developing a posteriori error                      estimates and the adaptive procedure.  The goal is to lay the                   foundation for adaptive techniques that are essential in the                    development of robust and reliable software for the global                      analysis of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits.                                      The existence of a trajectory connecting fixed points of an                ordinary differential equation, a homoclinic or heteroclinic                    orbit, is of special significance in a variety of applications.                 These trajectories have been shown to underlie the phenomena of                 intermittency in fluid mechanics and of \"bursting\" phenomena in                 mathematical biology; they appear in the chaotic behavior of                    electrical circuits, of lasers as well as light pulses in                       fiberoptics applications; they arise in chaotic behavior in                     structural mechanics and in a variety of chemical reactions where               chaoticoscillations in the reactant concentrations are due to the               presence of a homoclinic orbit.",
