 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surface reactions of organometallic compounds play an                           important role in growth of multilayered compound                               semiconductor structures by a variety of techniques including                   organometallic chemical vapor deposition (OMCVD), chemical                      beam epitaxy (CBE) and atomic layer epitaxy (ALE).  The                         synthesized compound semiconductor films such as AlGaAs, ZnSe                   and CdHgTe, in turn form the basis for advanced high-speed                      devices as well as solid state lasers and detectors.  High                      quality materials have been grown by trial and error                            approaches.  As applications continue to expand, the demand                     for increasingly more precisely controlled film stoichiometry                   and dopant concentrations requires improved understanding of                    basic growth processes.  Fundamental insight into                               organometallic surface reactions on compound semiconductors is                                                                                                  thus critical to the further development of thin film growth                    techniques and, implicitly, novel device applications.                          Identification of surface reaction mechanisms will also lead                    to improved process models suitable for reliable design of the                                                                                                  next generation of process equipment.                                                                                                                           This grant is for the purchase of Auger electron spectroscopy                   (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), temperature                      programmed desorption (TPD) surface analytical equipment for                    research in vapor phase growth of compound semiconductors for                   advanced high speed and optoelectronic devices.  The equipment                                                                                                  will be incorporated into an existing ultra-high vacuum system                                                                                                  used for chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) of compound                                semiconductors and already equipped with in situ Fourier                        transform infrared spectroscopy.  The surface spectroscopy                      tools will be used in systematic investigations of the                          fundamental adsorption and desorption processes of group V and                                                                                                  VI organometallic species, as well as their surface reactions                   with group III and II species.  The chemical structures of the                                                                                                  ligand will be systematically varied to explore the                             relationship between chemical structure and reactivity.  The                    PI will also investigate the surface reactions of these                         compounds with common group II and III precursors to elucidate                                                                                                  the growth mechanisms underlying the synthesis of important                     binary compound semiconductors.  These experimental studies of                                                                                                  adsorption, surface reaction, and desorption processes of                       group V and VI organometallic reagents should provide new                       insight into the growth of compound semiconductors by vapor                     phase techniques such as CBE and low pressure OMCVD.  They                      should also lead to new fundamental understandings of the                       relationship between metal-ligand structure and surface                         reactivity useful in the design of novel precursors.",
