 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project requests fund to participation of 30 minority                  faculty to attend the ACM Computer Science Conference and the ACM               SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education which run              consecutively at the same site.  This is an extremely worthwhile                endeavor as reported by the past years participants.  It is                     essential that minority faculty become exposed to the research                  culture which is effectively presented at conferences such as                   these.  Among the planned activities are (1) special sessions                   addressing unique programs for minorities, (2) panels addressing                funding opportunities for minority research programs, (3) an                    employment register, (4) student activities featuring minorities,               and (5) a special session in the chair's program dealing with                   administering a computer science program at a minority institution.                                                                                                                                                                             The funding will support attendance by approximately 25 minority                faculty at the ACM CSC 92, the SIGCSE 92 in Kansas City, March 3 -              7, and one workshop to enhance their skills.  It is important that              minority faculty attend national conferences in order to become                 better integrated into the research and education communities.                  This project represents a strong effort in that directions.//",
