 "awd_abstract_narration": "The large climate change oceanographic programs JGOFS (Global Ocean             Flux Study) and WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) now being             implemented require data management systems which will make                     possible the exchange and synthesis of diverse and widely spread                data sets.  Substantial progress on a data management system for                JGOFS (and potentially other programs such as WOCE and other global             change initiative) which:  can be easily used as a simple, but                  flexible, database on microcomputers and workstations; will have                common database features for combining and manipulating data sets,              and have non-common but scientifically useful features such as                  interpolating one data set against another; will be \"extensible,\"               meaning that new features or operations can be added at any time                without requiring the alteration of existing software or                        operations; can be easily used to import data from other PI's and               data archives, both national and international, over a network;                 will impose minimal format restrictions on user's data; and will                give users of larger machines simple procedures for gathering data              from many sources over networks without regard to the originator's              or end user's data format.                                                                                                                                      In addition, a number of data sets which will be of interest in                 JGOFS planning and synthesis work are being gathered, edited and                placed on-line.  This part of the effort, in addition to its                    scientific value, provides a number of diverse data sets for                    testing and demonstrating the capabilities of the system.  This                 current renewal effort will complete the development and                        installation of this system.",
