 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a research collaboration                                between a group headed by Prof. John Sclater of the                             Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Prof. Ricardo                           Fernandez of the Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y                           Educacion Superior de Ensenada (CICESE) of Mexico.                              The purpose of the collaboration is to study the                                relation between heat flow and depth in the Gulf of                             Mexico.                                                                                                                                                         The old ocean floor of the western Gulf of Mexico has                           the lowest heat flow observed through oceanic crust.                            Most researchers have ignored these data, which was                             collected in the 60's, attributing the low values to                            unusually rapid sedimentation or to non-linear thermal                          gradients.  However, a re-analysis of much of the data                          suggests that the role of non-linear gradients has                              been exaggerated and that much of the data may be                               reliable.  For this project, the investigators intend                           to carry out detailed heat flow surveys around two                              sites in the Gulf of Mexico, make individual                                    measurements on a transect between the two sites,                               analyze these data, and determine whether it supports                           the thermal boundary layer model indicated by the                               earlier measurements.",
