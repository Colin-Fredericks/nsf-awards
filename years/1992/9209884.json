 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents basic research into how small hormonal             and neurotransmitter molecules called peptides are used as                      messengers between cells and organs. We are attempting to discover              how information is written on the structure of these small                      molecules and read by the target tissues. What are the rules of                 this molecular language? This type of basic information has                     potential for future application indirectly to the development of               new pharmaceuticals for various human and animal diseases, and                  directly to the applications in agriculture and the control of                  vector-borne disease. Utilizing mosquitos as subjects, we limit the             use of vertebrate animals and can economically obtain millions of               insect subjects for our experiments. Also, by using mosquito                    subjects, we can direct the results of the research toward the                  development of a new generation of potential-specific insecticides              that have potential for removing harmful effects to humans,                     beneficial insects and the environment. Specifically, the project               is designed to isolate and determine the structure of peptides that             effect a physiological process critical to mosquito survival, water             and salt elimination. The structures of these naturally occurring               peptides will allow synthetic versions of the native peptides to                be prepared for the generation of antibodies and for receptor                   investigations. The antibodies will be used to locate sites of                  storage and release of the peptides within the mosquito. This                   should help determine if each peptide is a neurohormone, a                      neurotransmitter or a extraneuronal peptide. Synthetic analogs of               the native peptides will be designed to probe the receptor(s)                   tissue location, molecular structure, and binding site surface. The             interaction between receptors and peptides are a critical and                   perhaps the most important single form of intercellular                         communication that integrates a collection of cells into an                     organism.",
