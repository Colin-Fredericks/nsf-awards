 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to produce more reliable and                    detailed estimates of the industrial distribution of the U.S.                   labor force for the nineteenth century than is currently                        available.  The project will estimate the number of male and                    female workers, by age category, and by urban and rural location,               engaged in the major industries within the nonfarm sector.  This                will be done for each state at each decennial census benchmark                  date in that century.  Regional and national totals will be                     derived as the sum of the state figures.  Of some importance is                 the fact that these figures will be consistent with the most                    recent estimates of the total, farm, and nonfarm labor forces for               this period.                                                                                                                                                    The work will make extensive use of the Federal census data,                    supplemented, especially in the earlier years of the century, by                evidence from state censuses, city directories, and the research                of others on specific industries or locales.  The more detailed                 censuses for 1850 through 1900 will provide the foundation of the               detailed breakdown.  Those details will be used to disaggregate                 the evidence available in the 1820 and 1840 censuses.  In turn,                 that fuller set of data will be used to estimate the figures for                1800, 1810 and 1830.                                                                                                                                            These detailed figures will permit more careful analysis of a                   number of issues important to a full understanding of the growth                and evolution of the U.S. economy.  These include estimation of                 the nation's output in the years 1800 through 1840, estimation of               the regional breakdown of output, analysis of the nation's and                  the regions'sources of economic growth, and analysis of the rise                of the service economy.",
