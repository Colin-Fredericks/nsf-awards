Through hands-on laboratory                      activities, participants will learn about the deterioration of the              environment as it affects land, air, and water resources, and the role          of scientist and engineers in protecting and reversing this                     environmental damage.  Utilizing New York City's natural resources as           well as its professional scientists, engineers, and mathematicians,             students will also learn about science from a socially responsible and          ethical perspective.  TERRA  brings together practicing scientists,             college faculty, and high school teachers to challenge and motivate             minority ninth graders to stay in school, take additional courses in            high school, and learn about career opportunities in these fields.",
