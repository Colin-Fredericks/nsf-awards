 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Drosophila simulans, a vertically transmitted, cytoplasmic                   incompatibility factor causes reduced egg hatch when infected males             mate with uninfected females.  The incompatibility seems to be                  associated with an intracellular parasite (Wolbachia) that is                   spreading rapidly in California.  The goal of the research during               the year of recommended funding is to understand further the                    population biology of this system by:  1) continuing to monitor the             spread of the infection in California and its effect on the                     distribution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants; 2) determining              whether the presence of Wolbachia can be assertained by progeny                 tests; 3) obtaining additional estimates of incompatibility levels              and deleterious fitness effects in polymorphic natural populations;             and 4) using field and laboratory data to construct mathematical                models describing temporal and spatial frequency dynamics in the                field.  The new data and analyses are essential for describing and              understanding the rate of spread of the infection and assessing the             adequacy of current models.  This system offers an unusual                      opportunity to study rapid changes in natural populations.  The                 rapid northward spread in California provides many replicate                    populations in which similar frequency changes are occurring.  A                central issue is whether the selection and migration parameter                  values that describe the dynamics in one area will accurately                   predict the dynamics elsewhere.  The joint dynamics of the                      infections and mtDNA variants provide a model system for the                    introduction of cytoplasmically inherited variants into natural                 populations.  Such variants may be useful in controlling insect                 pests.  Given the reduced funding recommended for one year only,                the PIs will concentrate on providing detailed maps of the                      infection frequency during the fall, spring and summer of 1992-93.              A major goal will be to have a standardized molecular assay for                 determining whether individual field caught flies are infected, and             to determine the phenotypic association between the presence of the             infectious agent and incompatibility as revealed by progeny tests.              To the extent that time and money permit, the PIs also plan to                  continue monitoring the frequency of (mtDNA) variants that are                  \"hitch-hiking\" along with the infection, and to obtain additional               field estimates at different sites and in different seasons of the              incompatibility levels and reductions of fecundity caused by the                infection.",
