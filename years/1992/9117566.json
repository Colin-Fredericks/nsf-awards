 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmogenic chlorine-36 buildup dating is a new                             geochronological method that measures how long a rock has been                  exposed to cosmic rays on the earth's surface, rather than the                  time since it became a geochemically closed system.  The method                 can thus be used to date the construction of landforms, such as                 glacial moraines, that are difficult or impossible to date using                conventional methods.  This award supports glacial chronology                   investigations by cosmogenic 36Cl buildup at four locations (1)                 measurements on samples from Mauna Kea, (2) the Wind River Range,               Wyoming, (3) Banks Island, NWT. Canada, and (4) one other site in               the High Arctic.  These sites will provide a latitudinal transect               of the northern hemisphere to test whether the chronological                    pattern previously observed at Hawaii and the Sierra Nevada was                 due to coincidental local anomalies or to truly global climate                  effects.  One potential implication of a positive result would be               that the growth of continental-scale ice caps may be more a                     response to internal dynamics than global climate forcing.",
