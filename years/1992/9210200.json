 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses computer-aided design (CAD) data                      modeling and view construction, as well as updating both                        materialized views and the underlying database in support of                    design activities. Database support provides a means to share                   data between CAD tools and multiple designers; however, only a                  small portion of the contents of a database may be germane to a                 particular design application. A copy of the relevant data (a                   materialized view) may be stored and modified locally during a                  design step. Maintaining consistency between a database and views               of it entails ensuring that changes to the database are reflected               in the view data, and vice versa. Database view technology to                   efficiently and correctly support extraction and manipulation of                relevant views of design objects will be developed, including a                 formal CAD data model and an extended object-oriented query                     algebra for view specification. Algorithms for view maintenance                 will be derived from the formal semantics. Database support for                 CAD offers opportunities for concurrent design by simplifying the               maintenance and sharing of technology-related data. View                        processing provides a conceptual framework for unifying a CAD                   software environment; both the input and output of a tool are                   views of a design. This research seeks to facilitate                            interoperability of tools and cooperation between designers via                 CAD database view technology.",
