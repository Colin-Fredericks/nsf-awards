 "awd_abstract_narration": "A differential algebraic equation (DAE) is an implicit                     ordinary differential equation of the form F(y,y,u(t),t)=0 where                y(t) is a vector valued function, the Jacobian F y is a singular                matrix, and u(t) is a vector valued function of source or control               terms.  Many problems are most naturally initially modeled as a                 DAE.  They arise, for example, in a variety of control problems                 in flight control, robotics, chemical process control, and                      contact or constrained problems in mechanics.  In addition,                     differential algebraic equations occur in the solution of partial               differential equations by the method of lines and in many circuit               models.  DAEs are sometimes also called singular or descriptor                  systems.                                                                             The long range goal of the proposed research is for                        scientists and engineers to be able to work directly with the                   original implicit model thus reducing design and simulation time                as well as facilitating the consideration of more complex                       problems.  Existing numerical codes, while very useful, require                 special problem structure and do not handle many problems of                    interest.  This project will develop a general numerical method                 for nonlinear differential algebraic equations.  These results                  will also be of interest when explicit models exist, but the                    sparsity, nonlinearity, or dependence on parameters of the                      equations, make the original implicit system preferable to a                    lower order, but non-sparse, (or difficult to compute local)                    explicit system.",
