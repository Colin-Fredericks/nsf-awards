 "awd_abstract_narration": "This supplemental award will fund a one year program titled,               \"Environmental Issues in the Science Classroom:  Management of                  Hazardous Substances\", at the NJIT Hazardous Substance Management               Research Center (HSMRC), an NSF I/UCRC.  This project is designed               to improve the teaching of science at the junior high/middle school             level (grades 6-8) through an integration of professional                       development activities for teachers.  Sixteen (16) junior                       high/middle school teachers will participate in a 6-week summer                 (1992) program which will consist of a 3-week intensive, content                based workshop followed by a 3-week internship in a HSMRC                       affiliated industrial laboratory.  During the following 1992-1993               academic year, teachers will integrate their experiences into their             science curriculum, with the assistance of NJIT faculty involved in             curriculum improvement activities at these grade levels.   This                 project is a continuation of a highly successful program undertaken             by NJIT in the summer of 1991.  This project will be funded for one             year at $104,165.  The Education and Human Resources Directorate,               Teacher Enhancement Program will provide one-half of the total                  funding for this project.                                                            The Program Director recommends that NJIT be awarded a total               of $104,165 for one year.  Of this amount the I/UCRC program will               provide $5,208, the Engineering Infrastructure Development Division             will provide $48,874, and the Teacher Enhancement Program in the                Education and Human Resources Directorate will provide $52,082.",
