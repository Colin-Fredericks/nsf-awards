 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand the hormonal basis of                 social behavior, particularly aggressive and parental behavior in               birds.  The research will focus on two closely related species of               jays that live in close proximity to each other in Arizona but                  have very different social systems.                                                                                                                             This collaborative research effort will bring together Dr. Jerram               Brown's long-term (more than 20-year) study of Mexican jays, in                 which the genealogies and breeding history of a large number of                 color-banded birds are known, with a study by Dr. Carol Vleck on                the hormonal basis for the different behaviors that individual                  jays exhibit.  Of particular interest are (1) the mechanisms that               permit co-existence of many individuals within a social group in                Mexican jays but not in scrub jays and (2) the mechanisms that                  promote parental-like (helping) behavior in non-breeding Mexican                jays (e.g., why these birds help raise the young of others rather               than breeding themselves).  The research will concentrate on                    testosterone, which in other species is important in controlling                both aggressive and sexual interactions between individuals, and                on prolactin, which is important in promoting parental behavior                 in birds.  By correlating hormone levels in small blood samples                 with the behavior of the birds, and by altering the levels of                   these hormones in free-living individuals, Drs. Vleck and Brown                 will test the hypotheses that (1) high levels of prolactin are                  responsible for both parental and helping behavior and that (2)                 group living is promoted by a general decrease in testosterone                  levels.                                                                                                                                                         This study will shed light on the hormonal basis for the                        differences in reproductive behaviors of individuals within one                 species and will also provide information on the hormonal bases                 of very diverse social organizations in different species.",
