 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Science in Developing Countries award supports collaboration               between James Gill of the University of California at Santa Cruz                and Eduardo Malavassi of the Universidad Nacional in Costa Rica.                The project aims to test the investigators' hypothesis that a                   recently discovered geodynamic discontinuity in central Costa                   Rica has a fundamental influence on the chemical composition of                 magmas there.                                                                                                                                                   Circum-Pacific magmatism causes most of the earth's volcanic                    hazards and is the chief mechanism for maintaining and                          reprocessing the earth's crust.  The magma's origins are poorly                 understood.  The Nicaragua-Costa Rica sector of the Central                     American volcanic arc constitutes an important natural laboratory               for studying the nature of and reasons for spatial and temporal                 variations in the composition of young volcanic rocks.  This                    project will lead to insights into the magma-forming process at                 arcs, a vital topic in volcanology.  The researchers will collect               and prepare recent volcanic rocks in Costa Rica and perform                     labwork in the United States.  The Costa Rican research has                     expertise in the collection, selection, and preparation of                      samples specific to Costa Rica.  The U.S. researcher, a world                   expert in arc volcanoes, will provide SRF and mass spectrometry                 isotope analysis, capabilities which Costa Rica lacks.",
