 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project has two objectives: (1) for the investigator to               learn molecular cloning by isolating a new member of the TGF-                   beta superfamily from mammalian cells through work in the host                  laboratory, learning state-of-the-art cloning of membrane proteins;             and (2) to make sea urchin cDNA libraries from embryos, and with                these and host laboratory resources, to search for clones for TFG-              beta receptors and integrin receptors.  The investigator will begin             by using low-stringency hybridization to look for sea urchin clones             of TGF-beta and integrin receptors.  If too many clones are found               she will design redundant oligo-nucleotide probes and use PCR                   techniques to try to isolate sea urchin probes from her libraries, or           prepare antibodies to redundant peptide sequences in the integrin               receptors and screen expression libraries for clones.  Finally, she             will use her own antibodies to the putative 200kDa-laminin                      receptor to screen for clones in the sea urchin libraries.  The long            term goal is to understand how receptor molecules on the surface                of cells interact with specific molecules of the extracellular matrix           to signal or aid cell movements and morphogenesis of embryos.                   With preliminary evidence that the interaction of the extracellular             matrix protein, laminin, by interacting with cell receptors may                 stimulate or mediate gastrulation these embryos, the investigator               has begun to purify membrane proteins from sea urchin embryos                   that bind to extracellular matrix components.  She has found one                protein that binds laminin--the first identification of a matrix                receptor in sea urchin embryos, and is currently searching for                  other integrin proteins that may bind laminin or fibronectin using              an antibody evolutionary tree from sea urchins to mammals,                      significantly overlap.                                                                The investigator, an expert on the regulation of translation in           echinoderm egg and embryos, is changing the emphasis of her                     own laboratory to study the role of membrane receptors and                      extracellular matrix molecules in morphogenetic movements of sea                urchin embryos.  The studies on sea urchins, a model for the easy               visualization and manipulation of development, are potentially very             important for furthering our understanding of cell-extracellular                matrix interactions as determinants of embryonic cell movement                  and differentiation, particularly the critical processes of                     gastrulation, and similar processes such as imaginal disc                       formation in Drosophila or neurulation in vertebrates.                                This project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                   opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:  giving            lectures/seminars; lecturing in a number of graduate and                        undergraduate courses, including developmental biology,                         introductory biology, and advanced cell biology; working with                   graduate student women participating in the on-going biology                    brown-bag lunches; and giving a lecture to the Cambridge                        Chapter of the Association of Women in Cell Biology (AWIS).",
