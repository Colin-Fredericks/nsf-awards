 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project, sponsored by                   the Chemistry Division, Prof. Anderson (SUNY Stonybrook) will                   develop a new and powerful method for preparing polyatomic ions                 in specific excited vibrational states. The effect of specific                  vibrational excitation on ion reactivity will then be studied                   by high resolution molecular beam methods. The primary question                 to be answered is, \"in what range of molecular size and                         vibrational energy are vibrational mode effects important?\" A                   clear answer to this question will determine the future course                  of research in this field for many years to come.                               %%%                                                                             Bonds which hold molecules together are not rigid; they stretch                 and vibrate. A long sought goal of physical chemistry is to                     influence the course of chemical reactions by stimulating                       specific vibrations in order to facilitate breaking specific                    bonds. Prof. Anderson (SUNY Stonybrook) will develop a new                      method for doing this using simultaneous irradiation by lasers                  of two different wavelengths. This is important because the                     method can be applied to larger and more chemically relevant                    molecules than was previously possible.",
