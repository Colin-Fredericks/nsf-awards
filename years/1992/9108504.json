 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many senses the harmonic analysis of Euclidean space is                 well developed.  The theories of fractional integration, singular               integrals, parametrices for constant coefficient partial                        differential operators, and related matters are well understood.                In all of these theories, translation invariance plays a crucial                role.  In particular, Fourier analysis is a central tool in all                 of this work.  Many physical problems - the flow of gas around an               obstacle, turbulence, problems of flux, Dirichlet and Neumann                   problems, etc. - have as their natural setting a smoothly bounded               domain (where the necessary degree of smoothness may vary with                  the application).  The canonical setting for many of the basic                  problems of harmonic analysis and of complex function theory is                 also a domain in space.  Thus, it becomes appropriate to develop                analytic tools tailored to the geometry of domains.  This leads                 to reconsidering classical function spaces on these domains and                 to studying them with the use of invariant metrics.                                  This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research                    Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on New Function Spaces                  and Geometric Analysis in Several Complex Variables to be held                  May 26-31, 1992 at George Mason University.  Professor Steven                   Krantz of Washington University will be the principal lecturer.                 To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical research, the                National Science Foundation each year supports a number of NSF-                 CBMS Regional Research Conferences in the Mathematical Sciences.                Each five-day conference features a distinguished lecturer who                  delivers ten lectures on a topic of important current research in               one sharply focused area of the mathematical sciences.  The                     lecturer subsequently prepares an expository monograph based upon               these lectures, which is normally published by the American                     Mathematical Society or the Society for Industrial and Applied                  Mathematics, or jointly by the American Statistical Association                 and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.  Certain features                 differentiate these conferences from typical research                           conferences.  These are: (1) Focus on a single important and                    timely area of research by a leading practitioner, (2) Continued                effect and local stimulation through regional emphasis, (3) Panel               review for quality, breadth, and timeliness, and (4) Published                  monographs for a wider audience.",
