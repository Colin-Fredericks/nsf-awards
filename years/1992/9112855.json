 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Institute for Conservation (NIC) is an                        organization devoted to the preservation of historical objects for              research.  The Institute's traditional focus has been on objects                in the arts, humanities, ethnography, archeology, and anthropology,             but the organization's vision has broadened recently to include                 natural history specimens.  Dr. Donald Duckworth, President of the              Bernice P. Bishop Museum of Natural History, proposes an initiative             aimed at preserving natural history collections curated in museums              and herbaria.  NIC would conduct a series of meetings between                   materials scientists, conservators, and museum curators to better               define preservation problems and materials research needed to                   protect museum and herbarium specimens.  These meetings would                   result in a series of reports outlining recommendations for                     specimen care, materials research, and training of museum                       professionals.                                                                       Museum and herbarium specimens are unique objects that record              the biological diversity on earth.  As natural habitats shrink and              species become extinct, these specimens become irreplaceable                    objects of study.  Future generations of biological research will               rely on the preservation of these specimens, and the proposed                   workshop activities will set in motion a long-term planning                     process.  These planning activities will formulate recommendations              and priorities, and will greatly advance the research community's               ability to preserve these resources.",
