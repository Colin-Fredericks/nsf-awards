 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Active-Learning Curriculum for Computer Science                              This project is producing a series of learning modules designed                 to help students to develop the problem solving skills central                  to doing computer science.  Each module is a collection of                      interactive visualizations and related materials centered                       around a fundamental concept in computer science.  Typical                      materials include a student guide and a teacher's guide, the                    code for the visualization programs, manipulative materials                     such as games or puzzles, a collection of exercises, suggested                  closed labs and programming projects, and a Hypercard stack                     containing an explanation of the module's central topic and an                  annotated bibliography.  The code portion of the modules is                     carefully designed to teach basic software engineering                          principles, both directly and by example.                                                                                                                       Manipulative materials allow the students to gain an intuitive                  feeling for the problem to be solved.  Visualizations                           illustrate the central topic, a programming construct, a data                   structure, or an algorithm.  Each program is designed                           individually, so that the graphic animation best represents the                 desired concept, and the user interface allows for interactive                  user experimentation.  The visualizations can also be used to                   demonstrate concepts in lectures.  The Hypercard stacks give                    background information and in-depth explanations that students                  can explore at their own pace.                                                                                                                                  All software is being developed on Macintosh computers in THINK                 Pascal using QuickDraw.  Students have access to the source                     code, for reading and for reuse in their own projects.",
