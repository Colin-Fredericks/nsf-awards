 "awd_abstract_narration": "In certain invertebrate model systems which contain large,                      recognizable nerve cells, the individual nerve cells are known to               control behavior by the release of specific neurochemical                       transmitters. In one of these model systems, the brain of the                   leech, the neurotransmitter serotonin directly activates the organs             of ingestion. These effector neurons which regulate feeding                     behavior are in turn controlled by the activity of two classes of               sensory cells. Sensory cells that detect potential prey organisms               excite the neurons to fire and release serotonin. Sensory cells                 that respond to distension of the body resulting from a meal both               inhibit the feeding neurons from firing and terminate feeding. In               this award Dr. Charles Lent will investigate the relationship                   betwen feeding behavior and neuronal firing patterns; his studies               will also use specific nerve cell staining and sensitive chemical               assays to describe the anatomy and transmitters of sensory cells                that control the activity and serotonin levels in the large nerve               cells that are responsible for feeding. Because the behavioral                  states of hunger and satiation are separable, these studies will be             able to demonstrate the way in which communication between nerve                cells regulates the amount of transmitter that expresses either one             or the other of these two behavioral states. This research will                 contribute fundamental knowledge about the neurochemical                        organization and control of feeding behavior.",
