 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research program would elucidate the molecular and                 supermolecular processes involved in the intracellular synthesis of             reserve polyesters by bacteria and their intracellular and                      exocellular depolymerization by enzymes.  Specific goals of the                 program include:  (1) an understanding of the cellular transport                processes and biochemical reactions involved in the utilization of:             (a) good-growth good-polymer producing substrates, (b) good-growth              non-producing substrates, and (c) non-growth substrates, especially             in the cometabolism of mixtures of (a)+(b) and of (a)+(c) by which              the coploymers from the non-productive substrates, (b) and (c), are             produced; (2) an understanding of the enzymatic processes involved              in polymer formation within the granule, especially the number,                 activity and location of the polymerase enzymes and the ability of              isolated granules to participate in extracellular polymerization                reactions; (3) an understanding of the interaction between                      depolymerase enzymes and individual polymer molecules, especially               on solid surfaces.  Additional goals of the program include the                 following: (i) to prepare entirely new, non-natural polyesters and              evaluate their materials properties (including biodegradability) as             plastics or elastomers; (ii) to contribute to the basic                         understanding of the biochemistry of cometabolism by using polymer              production as a model system; and (iii) to isolate and characterize             the intracellular polymerase and depolymerase enzymes excreted by               bacteria and fungi that can utilize these polyesters as growth                  substrates in their biodegradation in natural environments.                     %%%                                                                             Polyesters have proven to be extremely versatile thermoplastics in              wide use in many industrial products.  They can be fabricated into              films, fibers and molded products.  Polyester can also be used for              packaging as well as in pure form, or when blended with wool,                   cotton, etc., for clothing material.  These products produced                   chemically from petroleum provide many useful and indeed necessary              items for industrial and medical uses.  However, because they are               synthetic organic chemicals from petroleum distallates, they are                not biodegradable in any known current process and waste disposal               of these products is an increasing problem world wide.                          Polyesters of identical chemical makeup and properties can be made              by a large number of bacteria.  Because they are made by enzymes in             cells as opposed to chemical synthesis, they produce stereoregular              polymers which are fully biodegradable.  Essentially, these                     bacteria use biosynthetic polyesters as food.  Theoretically these              polyesters can be treated for disposal like any organic waste.  We              will be undertaking a study of the enzymatic mechanisms of                      degradation of these new biomaterials.  In addition we have shown               that these bacterial or \"natural\" polyesters have many new and                  potential properties that cannot be duplicated by chemical                      synthesis.  For instance we have discovered a bacterium that can                synthesize a polyester that is an elastomer, i.e. it behaves like               rubber.  The use of such a product in the production of many items--            surgical gloves for example that are biodegradable or diapers with              biodegradable plastics liners would be a big advance in solving the             plastic waste disposal problem.",
