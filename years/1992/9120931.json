 "awd_abstract_narration": "A thorough investigation of the geometric parameters which                      govern the interaction of one part of a molecule with another                   part of the same molecule will be conducted. The interactions                   to be investigated will include processes which result in                       energy transfer and/or chemical reaction. The base absorbing                    chromophore to be investigated will be an aromatic ketone. By                   careful choice of geometry in the aromatic ketone, it will be                   possible to define for the first time the restrictions imposed                  by atomic and electronic orientation on chemical processes of                   excited aryl ketones. The projects to be investigated will                      include: (1) measurement of the kinetics of processes involving                 triplet cycloaddition, hydrogen abstraction and intramolecular                  triplet energy transfer; (2) observation of biradical                           partitioning; and (3) determination of the spin multiplicity of                 benzene-halogen cleavage reactions. Classical photochemical and                 photophysical methods will be utilized throughout the project                   to provide a thorough examination of the mechanisms involved.                   %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Peter J. Wagner at Michigan State                  University. The investigation will be aimed at probing the                      means by which energy is transferred from one part of a                         molecule to another. This work is particularly important since                  the process of how two parts of the same molecule interact is                   at the heart of many chemical processes which occur in both                     natural and synthetic molecules. The work to be conducted will                  provide the chemist, as well as other scientists, with a basic                  understanding of how chemical processes occur upon absorption                   of a photon of light. From this project will emerge a                           fundamental understanding of the constraints placed upon light                  induced processes by geometrical configurations of the groups                   comprising photoreactive molecules.",
