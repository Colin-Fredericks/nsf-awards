Water vapor is a                                                    particularly convenient source of                                               an abundant number of absorption                                                lines in the spectral region of                                                 interest.  The unique feature of                                                the proposed stabilization                                                      technique is the use of                                                         interferometric phase detection of                                              the zero-crossing point of the                                                  anomalous dispersion curve at the                                               position of line center.  Phase                                                 detection has the advantage of                                                  being insensitive to intensity                                                  fluctuations and to dynamic                                                     imbalances between the interfering                                              beams.  OPTRA proposes to use a                                                 powerful phase measurement                                                      algorithm and associated electronic                                             processor, developed for a                                                      different application in precision                                              metrology, to sense phase with a                                                precision of better than 0.001                                                  radian-corresponding to a laser                                                 diode frequency stability of better                                             than 1 part in 108 for a 10 kHz                                                 measurement bandwidth.  Our primary                                             motivation in this program is the                                               development of a small, efficient                                               and inexpensive replacement for the                                             gas lasers presently used for                                                   precision metrology.  Another                                                   application of potential commercial                                             value is the generation of stable                                               microwave frequencies with an                                                   enormous tuning range (by mixing                                                the outputs from two stabilized                                                 lasers).",
