 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eventual goal of Quinn's program is to develop invariants              of smooth compact 4-manifolds which, for example, could detect                  counterexamples to the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare conjecture.                The first part of the program (this project) will be devoted                    primarily to study of a model problem, the Andrews-Curtis                       conjecture on 2-complexes.  The invariants under consideration are              \"topological quantum field theories\" in the sense of Atiyah and                 Witten.                                                                              The Poincare conjecture asserts that any manifold that has                 certain simple topological properties in common with a topological              sphere must actually be a topological sphere.  It was originally                stated for three-dimensional manifolds around the turn of the                   century and subsequently generalized to all higher dimensions.                  Curiously, all these generalizations have now been settled (in the              affirmative), but the original case for three-dimensional spheres               still resists all assaults.  The foregoing remarks apply to                     topological manifolds.  The situation is slightly different for                 smooth manifolds.  Here both the three- and the four-dimensional                versions of the Poincare conjecture remain open.  What Quinn is                 hoping to do is to settle the four-dimensional case, using methods              inspired by a mathematical formulation of quantum field theory.",
