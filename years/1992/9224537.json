 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preparation for and response to rapid onset physical events such                as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes test the ability of                   social systems to provide and meet the survival needs of a human                population.  This research will examine household pre-impact                    preparedness and post-impact restoration activities in South                    Florida following Hurricane Andrew.  The central focus will be an               examination of the ethnic differences in household response to                  warning and subsequent preparations as well as specific restorative             activities undertaken following impact.  Household preparation                  activities refer to potential loss of life and damage to property.              Household restoration activities include those actions undertaken               by households to deal with the emergency situation following impact             and short-term actions undertaken to restore some semblance of                  normal household function.  The multi-ethnic nature of South                    Florida will allow for a more complete examination and assessment               of ethnic variation in these activities.  This research will                    combine a field survey of approximately 300 households located in               heavily impacted areas and telephone surveys of approximately 1000              households serviced by Miami media markets and in the hurricane                 warning zone to assess ethnic variations in preparedness and                    restoration activities.                                                                                                                                         While the literature has often alluded to ethnic variations in                  disaster activities, the nature of these variations has yet to be               fully research.  Social science literature is replete with                      discussions of the importance of race and ethnicity for employment,             income, education, socioeconomic status, housing quality and                    ownership, access to political power, family organization and                   structure, and the like.  All of these factors play critical roles              in preparedness and restoration activities.  In addtion, there are              often language and other cultural differences among ethnic                      populations, such as those of South Florida.  From both a                       theoretical and applied perspective, it is important to understand              the role of ethnicity in disaster response and management.",
