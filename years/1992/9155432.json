 "awd_abstract_narration": "Founded in 1979, the Science Skills Center (SSC) is a non-profit                community based program which encourages young minority and                     female students to pursue careers in science, mathematics, and                  technology.  At its current two sites, located in Brooklyn, New                 York, approximately 400 students, ages six to eighteen, are                     enrolled in programs where they take accelerated courses in                     biology, chemistry, physical science, rocketry, oceanography,                   botany, and advanced mathematics.  Classes, which are presented                 within the cultural and linguistic understanding of minority                    children, provide students with an opportunity to recognize the                 relationship of science, mathematics, and technology to their                   everyday lives.  The SSC proposes to replicate its present                      programs, establishing three additional sites in the New York                   City area in three years.  The SSC also proposes to establish a                 systematic replication program which would assist other                         communities, both regional and national, to establish their own                 SSCs.  This project would require a resource person to guide                    communities in all aspects of program development.  To assist in                that effort, SSC proposes development of comprehensive                          educational and administrative manuals as well as the                           preparation of accompanying training and profile videos.                        Finally, the SSC proposes to develop a research module in                       software and manual form which would assess and track student                   learning, school performance, performance on standardized exams,                career aspiration and selection, and student attitudes in a                     community based science program targeting minority students.",
