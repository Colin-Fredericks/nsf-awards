 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with a wide range of topics in topology                 and related areas of algebra, algebraic K-thoery and algebraic                  geometry. Weinberger studies the surgery theory of stratified                   spaces, using analytic as well as topological techniques.                       Rothenberg studies equivariant surgery theory and other aspects                 of discrete group actions on manifolds.  The visitor, Madsen, is                collaborating on this project.  May studies various areas of                    equivariant algebraic topology and, with Kriz, has begun work on                motives in algebraic geometry.  Swan works on problems connected                with K-thoery and the  study of algebraic and topological vector                bundles,  Kriz has moved from the general areas of combinatorics                and is now studying various problems in algebraic topology,                     including an algebraic approach to mod p homotopy theory.                            The details of these various projects vary, but all are                    concerned in one way or another with reducing geometric                         information to a subject for calculation.  The nature of the                    geometric information involved is the crux of the problem.  While               questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth                   virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is far                      different with what are known as topological properties of                      geometric objects.  These are properties such as connectedness                  (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so                  forth.  All systematic study of such properties, for example, how               to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to               one of these properties or are only superficially different, or                 how to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all                  these have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they                  have been reduced to matters of calculation.  Modern algebra                    furnishes many of the tools and the attitudes toward the tools                  that are needed, but the interplay between the algebra and the                  topology remains a fascinating subject. It has in turn shed light               on subtle problems in modern physics, and this has recently been                repaid when physics provided a novel and fruitful way to look at                the topology.",
