 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in the area of particle astrophysics will be carried out               at the Center for Particle Astrophysics (CfPA) which has been                   established at the University of California, Berkeley (UC-B).                   The Director of the Center is Professor Bernard Sadoulet of the                 University of California, Berkeley.  There is cooperation and/or                collaboration with scientists in the Physics and Astronomy                      Departments at UC-B; the University of California, Santa Barbara;               the University of California, Santa Cruz; the University of                     California, Irvine; Stanford University, San Francisco State                    University; Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory; University of Chicago;                University of Hawaii, Brown University; Temple University and                   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.                                                                                                                         Astrophysics and particle physics are increasingly complementary                and interdependent sciences.  The CfPA provides a way to coordi-                nating and focussing research in particle astrophysics and brings               together  and/or coordinates the major theoretical and experimen-               tal skills to attack the fundamental problems of the discipline.                The Center is focussing its effort on the problem of dark matter                in the universe.  The dark matter is optically invisible, but it                is estimated that up to 90% of the mass in the universe may be in               dark matter.  Gravitational effects are observed that are thought               to be caused by dark matter.  A search for non-baryonic dark                    matter will be carried out by developing and using cryogenic                    detectors.  There will be observations of the cosmic background                 microwave (CMB) radiation to try to detect any anisotropy in the                CMB.  Theoretical studies indicate that there should be an aniso-               tropy in the CMB radiation, but there has not been a definitive                 measurement up to now.  Recent observations have shown that the                 universe has structure at very large scales, and observations of                the universe at large scales will be carried out.  A new project,               the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe (DEEP), will have sup-                port to do a design study for a multi-barrel super spectrograph                 that would be used on the new 10m Keck telescope.  Theoretical                  activities relating to the problem of dark matter will be                       supported.                                                                                                                                                      The Center will sponsor scientific workshops, carry out educa-                  tional and outreach activities, and be active in working with                   industries to improve the transfer of technology from the results               of research at the Center to industry and other scientists.",
