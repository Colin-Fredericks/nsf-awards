 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the mathematical theory of                          probability and its application, and consists of largely                        independent investigations by two principal investigator,                       Professors Dai and Hill.  Professor Dai's research will mainly                  focus on queueing networks, which arise from computer networks                  and manufacturing systems.  It includes justification of the                    Brownian approximation for multiclass queueing networks,                        understanding network performance when it is heavily loaded, and                computation of stationary distribution of a reflected Brownian                  motion.  The ultimate goal is to develop a robust set of computer               software tools that can accurately and efficiently predict the                  performance of a wide class of queueing networks.  Professor                    Hill's research includes: optimal stopping problems, especially                 order selection and minimax rules; partitioning or fair-division                problems in probability and statistics; one-sided limit laws and                probability bounds, especially for means and quantiles; and                     fusions of probabilities and their relationship to dilation,                    convex domination and martingales.                                                   The principal investigators will carry out research in both                theoretical and applied aspects of probability.  The more applied               topics include investigating the performance of queueing networks               (inter-connected service facilities populated by randomly                       arriving customers with random amounts of service requirements)                 which arise from computer networks and manufacturing systems, and               investigating optimal stopping theory (sequential analysis of                   time dependent random processes such as pollution levels in a                   city or stock prices).  At one extreme, this research is aimed at               developing practical computer software tools that can accurately                and efficiently predict the performance of a wide class of random               systems, and at the other extreme it is aimed at discovering new                basic mathematical theorems in abstract spaces and settings.",
