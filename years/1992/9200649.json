 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last two decades have seen an explosion in computational                    capacity, and a corresponding reorientation of statistics and                   econometrics toward making intensive use of computation to reveal               more about data and sharpen the inferences drawn.  Statistical                  examples are the development of robust estimation methods,                      graphical interfaces for data examination, and bootstrap and                    other resampling techniques to sharpen finite-sample inferences.                Econometrics examples are the development of semiparametric                     methods, nonlinear time series techniques, and simulation methods               for inference.  Incorporation of these methods into econometrics                courses and applied econometrics software has been uneven,                      particularly for methods developed primarily in statistics.  This               grant supports research and teaching conferences on statistical                 computation and econometric applications in order to address this               problem.  The activities planned under this project promote the                 use of current statistical methods and UNIX workstation software                in econometrics, encourage the augmentation of statistical                      software systems (such as the S language) with the procedures and               modules needed for many standard econometric procedures,                        familiarize statisticians with some of the methodological and                   computational problems encouraged in econometrics applications,                 and encourage joint developments of computational methods.                                                                                                      Three research conferences are planned, one in each year of the                 proposal.  The conferences deal with current issues in computer-                intensive methods in statistics and econometrics.  Three teaching               conferences will be held, again one in each year.  These                        conferences are designed to provide an intensive introduction in                methods and issues in statistical computation to groups of                      graduate students nominated by Departments of Economics and                     Statistics around the country.   These activities are coordinated               to achieve the objectives of (1) providing a statistical                        computing environment that integrates statistical and econometric               software, with documentation and tutorials that encourage more                  effective use of existing software by econometrics and statistics               faculty and graduate students, (2) identifying productive areas                 for research and development on statistical algorithms, and                     suggesting standards for econometric software, (3) encouraging                  the implementation of new algorithms in \"open look\" software, and               (4) providing \"how to\" materials to the econometric research                    community on setting up and operating a statistical computing                   environment for research and teaching, and on econometric                       software standards.",
