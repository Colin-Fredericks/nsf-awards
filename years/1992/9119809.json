 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frankia are N2-fixing, sporulating, gram positive,                         filamentous bacteria (Actinomycetales) capable of forming root                  nodules on a variety of predominantly woody perennial plants,                   including Alnus and Ceanothus.  These actinorhizal associations                 contribute significant quantities of nitrogen (50-150 Kg N ha-1                 ya-1) to temperate forest ecosystems.  In addition to enhancing                 forest productivity via nitrogen fixation, some actinorhizal                    plants, such as Alnus rubra in the Pacific Northwest, are                       important timber resources.  Ecological studies of Frankia in                   soil are in their infancy, primarily because of the difficulty of               isolating Frankia from soil and of differentiating Frankia                      strains from each other and from other soil microorganisms.  No                 Frankia have been isolated from Ceanothus, a plant important to                 forest productivity in Oregon.  Even alder, from which the                      majority of strains have been isolated, harbors many strains                    which cannot be cultured at this time.                                               In order to assess the diversity of Frankia in soil, it is                 necessary to develop efficient methods of DNA extraction and a                  means of distinguishing among Frankia strains.  This research                   will quantify and potentially improve soil DNA extraction                       efficiency.  It will also develop a means of differentiating                    among Alnus-infective Frankia strains based on differences in the               DNA sequence of rrn gene.",
