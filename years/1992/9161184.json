 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical issue in the development of digital high-definition             television (HDTV) is the reliable transmission of high-quality                  video images with minimum transmission bandwidth.  This creates a               need for efficient data compression algorithms for digitized image              sequences.  However, existing video compression techniques, such as             the CCITT standard, cannot consistently achieve high compression                ratios.  This study will involve an examination of two                          multiresolution representations, the development of motion                      estimation algorithms, and an evalutation of compression                        performance on selected video imagery.                                               The reviewers comment on the high quality of the proposal, the             science, the research plan and the qualifications of the PI and key             staff.  They point out areas where more detail in the proposal                  regarding the approach would have been helpful, but they are                    confident of the commercial viablilty in the potentially huge HDTV              market .  One reviewer states that the concepts are well known in               academia and may have already been investigated.  Program staff                 agrees with the high ratings of the two subpanelists, and believes              that while the concepts are known in academia, the implementation               proposed by the principal investigator has not been done.",
