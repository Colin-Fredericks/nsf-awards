 "awd_abstract_narration": "Incorporation of fluorine in organic molecules modifies their                   chemical and biological properties.  Many of the available                      fluorinating agents are non-specific and/or too difficult to                    handle.  One solution to this problem is the use of                             fluorine-containing smaller molecules that can act as building                  blocks in the synthesis of more complex organic molecules.                      Specifically new syntheses of vinyl fluorides from a common                     precursor, alpha-fluoro-gamma-substituted allylphosphonate,                     will be developed.  This precursor will permit the introduction                 of fluorine on the olefinic carbon in alpha, beta-unsaturated                   carbonyl compounds, and in conjugated dienals.  The initial                     introduction of fluorine on the allylphosphonate will be done                   using a well-known reagent, diethylaminosulfur trifluoride                      (DAST).  The methodology employed will utilize an electrophilic                 phosphorus reagent as a way to incorporate the phosphonate                      moiety in the vinyl fluoride precursor.  This will result in                    different substituents around the phosphorus, which in turn                     will make it possible to obtain greater stereochemical control                  on the fluoroolefin formed by the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE)                 condensation.                                                                   %%%                                                                             With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                 research of Dr. Gerald B. Hammond at the University of                          Massachusetts, Dartmouth.  The research will explore the                        development of new ways to introduce a fluorine into complex                    molecules under non-corrosive conditions.  This should benefit                  research in biochemistry and medicine as well as in the                         chemical industry.",
