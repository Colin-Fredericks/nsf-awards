 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of                    California, Santa Barbara supports an interactive,                              interdisciplinary program of materials research with a                          strong emphasis on the synthesis and processing of novel materials.             Research is currently organized into three major thrust areas.                                                                                                  Research on high performance electrical and optical polymers seeks              to synthesize and process highly oriented conducting polymers                   having unprecedented combinations of properties, and to                         characterize and understand their behavior.  The thrust area on                 synthesis and processing with solutions using templates focusses on             the chemistry and physics of a new approach for synthesizing                    materials with solutions, using either crystalline or molecular                 templates.  The intellectual focus of research on advanced                      materials derived from self-assembling complex fluids is on the                 synthesis, characterization and processing of materials derived                 from a class of fluid systems in which spontaneous ordering due to              short-range, electrostatic or surface forces is a critical factor               in determining macroscopic properties.                                                                                                                          The MRL also operates and maintains major central facilities for                materials research, and provides seed funds for exploratory                     research and new initiatives.  It supports programs in education                and human resources in the materials field, and administers                     programs involving knowledge transfer and outreach to other                     institutions and sectors, including industry and national                       laboratories.  The MRL currently supports the activities of about               25 faculty members, 5 postdoctoral research associates, 22 graduate             students, and 1 technical staff member.  The MRL central facilities             also support a substantial amount of research that is funded                    primarily from other sources.  The MRL at the University of                     California, Santa Barbara is directed by Professor Anthony G.                   Evans.",
