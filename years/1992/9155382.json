 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two year project, sponsored by the University of Lowell,                   will provide science teachers, grades 4-12, the expertise to                    carryout alternative testing techniques to assess student                       learning in the sciences.  The new assessment methods will                      enable teachers to discover what students know and thus to                      reshape student learning toward better comprehension of                         science concepts, more appreciation of the field of science                     and enhanced skills in scientific inquiry.  In the first year                   of the project 15 teachers will attend a series of workshops                    devoted to the concepts and practice of appropriate                             assessment techniques.  In the second year of the project the                   teachers will implement these techniques in the classroom.                      They will also work with selected peer teachers in workshops                    managed by project staff to disseminate the techniques to a                     wider group of teachers.  At the conclusion of the project                      there will be 45 teachers using high quality alternative                        assessments in their own classrooms and assisting peers to do                   the same.                                                                                                                                                       The NSF funds are being matched by the University and                           participating schools by an amount equivalent to 80% of the                     NSF grant.",
