The adaptive method will ensure                                                 optimal allocation of computer                                                  resources in terms of storage and                                               cpu time by automatically refining,                                             coarsening or reconstructing the                                                geometric mesh used to discretize                                               the equations in space throughout                                               the calculation. The method wil be                                              developed ina general way, in that                                              the innovations will be independent                                             of the geometry and equations to be                                             simulated.  This approach will                                                  benefit the many fields in which                                                the application of high order                                                   spectral methods can be used for                                                simulation of complex physical                                                  phenomena.                                                                      THe main tasks are the construction                                             of a rule-based system for                                                      refinement, the development of a                                                scheme for dynamic allocation of                                                space for the changing mesh                                                     connectivity information, the                                                   development of a mesh optimization                                              criterion, ensuring that the mesh                                               alteration is time-accurate and                                                 conservative and finally improving                                              the current error estimators and                                                preconditioners. The research                                                   entails theoretical and                                                         computational work and will include                                             a number of test and novel                                                      simulations.                                                                    The adaptive formulation of the                                                 spectral element method is aimed at                                             increasing the flexibility and                                                  range of capabilities of high order                                             methods in general.  High order                                                 methods provide highly accurate                                                 simulations with very fast rates of                                             convergence and are typically used                                              in the direct simulation of basic                                               physical phenomena.  The proposed                                               research will allow high order                                                  methods to deal with \"real\"                                                     engineering problems, rather than                                               idealized research problems, by                                                 reducing the needed computer                                                    resources by one to two orders of                                               magnitude.//",
