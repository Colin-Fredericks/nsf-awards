This project seeks to contribute to automatic                     systems capable of reasoning about a robotic environment based on               imperfect sensory data and recovering errors of robot motions                   caused by intrinsic and inevitable system uncertainties.                        Specifically, the project studies how to acquire sufficiently                   accurate information about the spatial state of an object in the                presence of sensing and modeling uncertainties and develops                     practical strategies for automatic assembly motions based on the                spatial states of the parts involved.  The project particularly                 focuses on, in the presence of uncertainties, the automatic                     recognition of unintended collision/contacts between a held part                (by a manipulator) and the environment by combining                             position/orientation sensing, vision sensing, and force/moment                  sensing, and the automatic generation of motion plans based on                  the obtained contact information, as remedy plans, to lead the                  part to its intended goal from the unintended collision/contact.                The project expects to result in the implementation of a                        prototype system capable of such automatic recognition of                       contacts and generation of contact-based plans, as well as proper               execution of the plans, all in the presence of uncertainties. //",
