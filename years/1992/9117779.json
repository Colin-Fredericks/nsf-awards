 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the first half of development, all calcium utilized by the               chick embryo is derived from yolk.  At mid-incubation, the                      chorioallantoic membrane grows out and comes in contact with the                shell membrane; thereafter it functions in mobilizing calcium from              the shell.  Excess calcium resorbed from the shell that is not                  utilized by the chick embryo is deposited in the yolk. Thus while               the chorioallantoic membrane transports calcium in one direction                (from shell to embryo), the yolk sac membrane is apparently able                to transport calcium both into and out of the yolk, by mechanisms               that are not well understood.  Chick embryos can be raised in                   shell-less culture, in which the only source of calcium is the                  yolk.  After about mid-incubation, shell-less embryos deplete their             supply of calcium from the yolk.  These embryos have low blood                  calcium values, poorly mineralized bones and fail to hatch.  Shell-             less embryos provided an excellent system for study of yolk sac                 membrane calcium transport, since their supply of shell calcium is              absent.  In these embryos, all calcium transport of calcium across              the yolk sac membrane is from yolk to embryo.  The transport of                 calcium across the yolk sac membrane and chorioallantoic membranes              will be measured in normal and shell-less cultured embryos.  The                effects of inhibitors and various calcium-regulating hormones on                these transport processes will be investigated.                                                                                                                 Another possible site of calcium regulation in the chick embryo is              the kidney.  There is almost nothing known about the function of                the kidney during development in vertebrate embryos. Birds offer                easy access to such studies, since the embryo is separate from the              mother.  The function of the kidney is filtering, reabsorbing and               excreting various ions will be studied at several developmental                 ages in normal and shell-less chick embryos. Additionally kidney                function will be studied in embryos treated with several calcium-               regulating hormones. //",
