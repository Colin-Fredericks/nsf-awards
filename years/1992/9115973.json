This dissertation                   improvement proposal intends to assess the use of bilateral                     asymmetries as a measure of pre-natal stress.  In order to                      investigate the relationship of stress to asymmetry, the student                will study cohorts of full-term infants of appropriate for age                  weights and compare the level of asymmetry exhibited in that                    group with the level seen in full-term growth retarded newborns.                Additionally, the parents of all infants will be measured for the               same suite of bilateral traits.  This will allow estimation of                  genetic versus environment effects.  The researchers hypothesize                that the normal weight infants will exhibit less bilateral                      asymmetry.  Additional, all newborns will be followed over one                  year and measured at defined intervals.  This will allow                        estimates of longitudinal changes in bilateral symmetry, a poorly               documented aspect of human biological variability.",
