 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amphiphilic molecules dispersed in aqueous solution spontaneously               assemble into structures thought to be defined by the size, shape               and chemistry of the entire system.  In the dilute region of the                phase diagram, phospholipids and surfactants undergo a vesicle-                 micelle transition with increasing fraction of surfactant.  Two                 types of micelle were observed recently, a cylindrical mixed                    micelle and small mixed micelles at higher surfactant levels.  The              phase behavior of phospholipids with surfactants at high water                  content will be examined to elucidate the process of structural                 transition in these mixed systems from a thermodynamic and kinetic              perspective.  The structures will be identified and the positions               of the phase boundaries determined as a function of amphiphile                  chemistry and thermodynamic parameters (temperature, pressure).                 cylindrical mixed micelles and their formation from small mixed                 micelles or vesicles will be characterized by separation                        techniques, fluorescence probes sensitive to the differences                    between these structures, nuclear magnetic resonance, and the                   kinetics of the transition.  Molecular packing models will be                   tested and the energetics of assembly will be calculated in order               to improve the quantitative models to be applied when using                     amphiphiles to create, for example, biological model membranes,                 drug delivery systems, and protein crystals.                                    %%%                                                                             The focus of this study is a class of molecules called amphiphiles.             The amphiphiles have two parts, an oily, nonpolar or hydrophobic                end, and a polar, hydrophilic end.  A special class of amphiphiles              is the phospholipids which along with amphiphilic proteins make up              the membranes that surround the biological unit of the cell.  When              amphiphiles are added to water, they self-assemble into clusters of             molecules with the polar hydrophilic groups facing the water and                the nonpolar hydrophobic groups clustered together in the center.               The shape and size of these structures depends on the shape and                 relative concentrations of the molecules that compose them.                     This study will focus on the biological amphiphiles dispersed in                water with a series of detergents that are used in biological                   studies.  The goals are to describe the structural transitions that             occur as the relative detergent concentration changes using                     electron microscopy and several spectroscopic techniques.                       Understanding these systems may have far-reaching consequences.                 Subtle changes in phospholipid structure are likely to regulate                 cell function.  Although the temperature and pressure affect the                characteristic properties of an amphiphiles - water system details              are not well known.  The general principles learned will have a                 broader application for all amphiphilic mixtures from detergent                 design to the rheology properties of mixture of oils and                        emulsifiers.",
