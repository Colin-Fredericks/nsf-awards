 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Anthony will study archaeological specimens and also conduct                experimental research to determine when horseback riding first                  began in Asia.  While it is generally believed that the horse was               first domesticated in this region about 4,000 years ago, recent                 evidence recovered by Dr. Anthony suggests that the true date is                at least 2,000 earlier.  What he has done is study the premolar                 teeth from archaeological specimens to look for microscopic                     traces of bit wear.  When ridden, horses usually chew on the bit                with these back teeth and when bits are made from metal, they                   leave a characteristic type of wear.  The problem which Dr.                     Anthony faces is that the earliest bits were made not of metal                  but either leather or rope and it is unknown either whether these               softer materials leave traces or what they might look like.                     Therefore his research will consist of two parts.  First, he will               travel to museums in Russia and Hungary and make casts of horse                 teeth recovered in archaeological contexts.  These are accurate                 to the microscopic level and can be studied by SEM.  Secondly, he               will organize an experiment in which three horses will be ridden                with three different soft mouthpieces for one year.  High-                      resolution moulds of their premolars will be made monthly to                    track the nature and progression of wear.  These experimental                   results will then be applied the archaeological material.                                                                                                       The beginning and diffusion of horseback riding altered the                     course of human history in Europe, Asia and the Near East.                      Riding applied an alternate source of energy to the                             transportation of people and materials, a source that is still                  the standard by which the power of transportation technologies is               measured.  The social and economic changes caused by this                       innovation provide the earliest historical example of human                     societies transformed by the introduction of a new transport                    technology.  This project will examine in detail the origin of                  this process.                                                                                                                                                   This research is important for several reasons.  It will increase               our understanding of the prehistory of a large portion of the Old               World.  It will shed new light on the long term effects of an                   important innovation and provide data of interest to a large                    number of archaeologists.",
