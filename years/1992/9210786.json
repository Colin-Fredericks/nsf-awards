 "awd_abstract_narration": "In accomplishing some tasks, biological visual systems can                    outperform even the most sophisticated image processing systems.                The goal of this research is to build optoelectronic circuits                   which perform some important image sensing and processing tasks                 in a somewhat similar manner to the biological visual systems.                  The circuits are then not only useful in performing these tasks                 better than conventional methods, but also provide a tool of                    analysis, a level of abstraction, for the original biological                   systems.  This goal is methodically pursued by proposing elements               of a visual system that are based on a basic model of ionic                     conduction in nerve membranes.  Processing capabilities of each                 of the proposed elements is demonstrated.  Next, more                           sophisticated tasks are proposed which can be performed by                      combining these basic elements together.  It is argued that this                intelligent control of acquisition of visual data is essential                  for real time operation in a complex dynamic world.//",
