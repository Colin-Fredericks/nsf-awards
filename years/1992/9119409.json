 "awd_abstract_narration": "Micro-organisms such as bacteria and fungi are the cause of many                diseases of plants and animals.  The implement successful disease               control, one needs to understand the population biology of the                  infectious organisms.  Knowledge of the extent and patterns of                  genetic variation in the pathogen population is particularly                    significant since disease control practices may not be equally                  effective against all genetic forms of the pathogen.  However,                  studies of the population genetics and ecology of micro-organisms               under natural conditions are often lacking simply because the                   organisms are small, have little morphological variation, and                   individual organisms are hard to distinguish.                                        Studies will be undertaken on the population biology of a                  naturally occurring fungus which infects plants in the Pink                     family.  Past studies of the plant revealed that host populations               can be genetically variable in their resistance to the anther-                  smut disease.  To investigate the extent of fungal genetic                      variation, a new-molecular technique called RAPD (Random                        Amplification of Polymorphic DNA) which can detect genetic                      differences among individuals will be used.  This will allow                    determination of the biology of the fungus, such as the degree to               which host plants are multiply infected and whether different                   strains of the fungus are more successful at infection than                     others.   This technique will also be used characterize patterns                of genetic variation among fungal populations, for instance the                 degree to which spatially separated populations are genetically                 distinct.                                                                            The anther-smut disease is a model system to study                         evolutionary and ecological interactions between hosts and                      pathogens.  In particular, this research will evaluate the                      usefulness of the RAPD technique for investigating aspects of                   pathogen population biology that have been previously ignored                   because of the lack of a method for distinguishing fungal                       individuals.  RAPD techniques have numerous potential                           applications in applied studies of host/pathogen interactions.                  For instance, it will be important to track the spatial dispersal               of micro-organisms to evaluate the spread of human-designed                     organisms (such as biocontrol agents) in the environment.  The                  RAPD technique has considerable promise in this regard because of               the high resolution it offers in distinguishing organisms.                      Further, since our model system makes use of naturally occurring                genetic variation, there are no problems in our study of                        introducing unknown new genetic variants into the environment.",
