For a three-year period beginning April             1992, ten (10) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks                 engaged in basic research under the direction of the faculty                    members in the Chemistry Department.  Students will be members of               active research groups, and participate in research projects                    designed to suit their training.  The program includes social                   events, tours, and a weekly seminar series featuring visiting                   industrial speakers in addition to faculty from the department.                 The seminars are aimed at the undergraduate audience, and provide               an excellent perspective on research careers and opportunities in               both industry and academics.  Student participants will be asked to             write a journal style research report and speak about their work at             regularly scheduled group meetings.",
