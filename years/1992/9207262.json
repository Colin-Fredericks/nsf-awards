 "awd_abstract_narration": "As AI planning systems are applied to more realistic problems,                  the issue of choosing among alternative plans arises.  The                      planner typically cannot prove that any alternative will or will                not be successful, and so it much choose among plans on the basis               of how likely they are to achieve their aims and how efficiently                they do so.  Decision theory supplies a normative model for                     making these choices, but is not directly applicable to the                     planning problem as AI has posed it, and more importantly does                  not provide a computational framework within which to make the                  choices.  In particular, decision theory offers no advice on how                to generate or modify plans.  Decision theory and symbolic AI                   planning algorithms therefore offer complementary strengths: the                former provides a rich representation for expressing choice among               alternatives and a theory of how to make those choices                          rationally; the latter provides a computational method for                      generating and improving plans, but under restrictive                           assumptions.  The two approaches will be integrated to produce a                practical decision-theoretic planner.  The research contains                    theoretical and computational; aspects, the former oriented                     toward reconciling the decision-theoretic and AI problem                        representations, the latter oriented toward developing an                       algorithm that efficiently builds, evaluated, and chooses among                 plan alternatives.",
