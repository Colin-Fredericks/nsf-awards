 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell-cell interactions play an important role in defining the                   fates of individual cells as they begin to differentiate. While                 much has been learned about the cell surface proteins that are                  necessary for these interactions, relatively little is known                    about cytoplasmic components of this process. The overall goal of               this research is to identify and functionally characterize                      Drosophila cytoplasmic proteins that are important for                          developmentally crucial signals. Specifically, these experiments                will examine the functions of the Drosophila homolog of the                     vertebrate cytoskeletal protein 4.1 (D4.1). The goals of this                   proposal are therefore to: 1) Examine the cellular and                          developmental effects of D4.1 mutations, 2) Characterize the                    major D4.1 alternative splice forms and determine the genomic                   organization of the gene that encodes them, and 3) Learn the                    precise expression patterns of the major D4.1 protein isoforms at               the cellular and subcellular levels, and determine the cellular                 and developmental effects of ectopic D4.1 expression. These                     experiments are expected to provide insights into the function of               both the Drosophila and the human 4.1 genes. Therefore these                    studies should contribute significantly to work on the role of                  cellular interactions in regulating cell growth and determining                 cell fate during development.",
