Their current facilities do                               not meet the requirements of modern laboratory                                  research projects.  The building which houses                                   these facilities was constructed nearly forty                                   years ago to provide classrooms and faculty                                     offices for the Mathematics and Physics                                         Departments, neither of which had significant                                   research activities at that time.  Since then,                                  Physics has become recognized as a pinnacle                                     research department within a university that is                                 dedicated to excellence in research and                                         scholarship as well as instruction and outreach.                                     Their laboratory research programs are                                     focused in three areas: surface science, nonlinear                              optics and laser spectroscopy, and solid state                                  physics.  Since the initiation of a vigorous                                    graduate program in the early 1960's, their                                     faculty has had to cope with antiquated laboratory                              facilities including inadequate utility services                                and crowded conditions.  Their modernized                                       facilities will tremendously expand their research                              horizons and help attract more qualified graduate                               and undergraduate students to programs, including                               women and minorities.  Further, these facilities                                will enhance aggressive outreach activities in                                  science education, telecommunications, and                                      technology transfer, and deepen collaborations                                  with engineering faculty.",
