 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new course titled Consequences of a Chemical World is being                   offered to both science and non-science majors in their                         freshman year in the university.  Novel and innovative aspects                  of this course include an assumption that a course on chemicals                 in the environment does not depend on a pre-existing base of                    chemical facts, and is best introduced at the start of a                        university curriculum, a belief that laboratories associated                    with the course should be completed outside of the university                   itself, in the arenas in which the real business of                             environmental assessment, monitoring, and regulation is                         achieved, that continued involvement of the students in                         environmental issues, and magnification of the impact of the                    course, can be accomplished through presentations by the                        students of selected aspects and topics of the course to others                 in local school and community forums. The course is divided                     into parts so that sub-sections, or even individual lectures                    and demonstrations, can be repeated in other universities, in                   high schools, and in community meetings.",
