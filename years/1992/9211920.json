 "awd_abstract_narration": "Courts depend on litigants -- individuals, government agencies,                 businesses and increasingly, interest groups -- to bring policy                 issues to their attention.  To understand the agendas of courts,                it is crucial to determine how litigants decide to bring claims to              court.  This dissertation grant provides support to Cary Coglianese             to examine how one important set of litigants, interest groups,                 decides which claims to file in court.                                                                                                                          While scholars have developed models explaining how individuals                 select claims to bring to court, the process of dispute selection               in organizations is much less understood.  Mr. Coglianese's                     dissertation research fills in this gap in sociolegal understanding             by developing and testing a model of organizational dispute                     selection.  Investigating interest groups active in environmental               policy, the study draws on interviews with the staff and legal                  counsel of 25 interest groups, as well as on an analysis of court               briefs and other primary sources.  In addition to advancing                     understanding of organizational dispute selection, the study's                  focus on dispute selection facilitates examination of how legal                 rules influence the decision-making of interest groups.                         Specifically, variations in environmental statutes on such matters              as standing, proof, and attorney's fees are examined to see how                 they influence interest groups' decisions about which cases to                  bring to court.  Therefore, the project also contributes to basic               understanding about the sociolegal dynamics influencing interest                group behavior.",
