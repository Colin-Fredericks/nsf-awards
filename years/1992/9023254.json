Van Gorkom in the Department of Astronomy at               Columbia University.                                                                                                                                                 The NSF Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers                   recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in teaching and             scholarship as well as the potential for continued significant                  contributions to scientific research, the academic profession, and              the education of future scientists.                                                                                                                                  The emphasis of the research will be on the formation and                  evolution of galaxies and the large scale structure of the                      universe.  These issues will be explored by making images of the                atomic hydrogen in and between galaxies, in isolated galaxies,                  interacting galaxies, small groups of galaxies, clusters of                     galaxies and in regions where there might be no galaxies at all,                the voids.                                                                                                                                                           The large-scale structure of the universe as we know it today,             with large filaments and sheets is based almost entirely on high                luminosity galaxies, seen at optical wavelengths.  Biased galaxy                formation predicts a separation between luminosity (bright                      galaxies) and mass (dark matter).  Dwarf galaxies are expected to               be more uniformly distributed and should be a better tracer of the              dark mass.  These dwarfs could be too faint to be included in                   optical catalogs.  They will be observed in the radio region of the             spectrum.                                                                                                                                                            Other similar surveys which will address slightly different                questions are a volume limited survey of the Hydra Cluster of                   galaxies and HI observations of all the optically known galaxies                in the Bootes void.  The Hydra survey will extend the determination             of the spatial distribution of gas rich galaxies to a very high                 density region.  Even more interesting will be a comparison of the              HI morphology of the galaxies in Hydra and in Virgo (already                    completed) with those in the Bootes void.  This will provide us                 with unique material on the effects of the environment on galaxies.                                                                                                  There will be several collaborators and graduate students                  involved in the projects.",
