 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is designed to determine whether interactions between                different types of neurons direct or influence the structural and               functional reorganization that takes place in the nervous system                during postembryonic development.  In both vertebrates and                      invertebrates motor circuits undergo structural and functional                  changes after birth or hatching.  Cell-cell interactions, as well               as humoral signals, such as steriod hormones, have been implicated              in influencing these postembryonic changes, but the respective                  contributions of hormonal signals and cell-cell interactions to                 neuronal differentiations in hormonally-sensitive systems have not              been well-defined.  This study will utilize an insect in order to               examine the influence of cell-cell interactions at the level of                 individual neurons during hormonally-controlled metamorphosis.  The             study will be centered around a previously identified motor neuron              that is present at both larval and adult stages but undergoes                   extensive remodeling of its dendritic processes during                          memtamorphosis.  Dr. Kent's objectives are to identify the                      interactions that differentially affect the motor neuron in                     specific regions of its dendritic arbor.  Surgical manipulations                and the use of mutant phenotypes will help identify the specific                classes of neurons that shape or regulate dendritic growth.                     Electrophysiological and anatomical methods will be employed to                 identify and characterize individual neurons that influence                     dendritic morphology of the identified motor neuron.  Information               gained by these studies will not only increase our understanding                of the relative contributions of cell-cell interactions and                     hormonal siganls to dendritic changes in a hormonally-sensitive                 system, but will contribute in a broader sense to an understanding              of basic developmental mechanisms.",
