 "awd_abstract_narration": "Riskin         New ways to use Vector Quantization (VQ) other than strictly  for data compression are being investigated, and are being  applied to applications such as image processing, halftoning,  progressive transmission, and immunity against communication  channel noise.   In many applications, both VQ and many image processing  operations are applied to small subblocks of an image. The image  processing step can be applied ahead of time to each vector in a  VQ codebook, with the processed vectors stored along with the  codebook. If the computational complexity of the VQ encoder is  lower than that of the image processing step, this reduces the  computational complexity. This approach is being applied to  halftoning, edge detection, and histogram equalization.          In a progressive transmission system, the received image is  reconstructed as an increasingly better reproduction of the  transmitted image as bits arrive. Ways to organize and order a VQ  codebook so that it can be used for direct progressive  transmission of full search VQ are being studied.  In an ordered  VQ, the VQ codeword index is correlated with the codeword  location in the input space. This ordinal mapping feature of  clustering codewords with similar indexes to obtain additional  reproduction vectors for the decoder is being exploited.   Extentions to progressive transmission of ordered VQ indexes over  noisy communication channels are being included.",
