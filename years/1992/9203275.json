 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tail is central to the origin of avian flight.  However,                    despite extensive attention to the wing,  the tail of birds has not             been the focus of developmental,  functional or paleontological                 studies.  Modern flying birds possess a very short tail compared                to Archaeopteryx and other theropod ancestors.  Tail reduction is               the product of fewer caudal vertebrae and the fusion of distal                  segments into a uniquely avian structure,  the pygostyle,  which                forms a base for the tail feathers.  In this research project,  the             PI will combine approaches from several disciplines to study the                evolution of this caudal morphology in birds.  (I) The quail-chick              chimera technique will be employed for a description of normal tail             ontogeny and for experiments to elucidate mechanisms of segment                 number regulation and pygostyle formation.  (II) The motor control              and kinematics of the tail will be quantified in a functional study             of the pigeon during eight locomotor modes.  (III) Pertinent fossil             birds will be reevaluated in light of the new information obtained              in (I) and (II).  Results from these studies will have significance             for each individual field.  However,  the unprecedented integration             of information from these three disciplines within a phylogenetic               framework will provide a more global perspective for evaluating                 how developmental,  functional and phylogenetic influences                      facilitate or constrain the evolution of form.",
