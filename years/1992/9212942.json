 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) regulates                 conditions in private sector establishments and has been one of the             most controversial examples of social regulation of the past two                decades.  On the one hand, OSHA has been charged with imposing                  needlessly high costs on firms.  On the other hand, the relative                stability in the overall incidence of workplace injuries in the                 last two decades since OSHA's passage suggests that it has had a                negligible impact on safety and health in the workplace.  Yet, only             a very limited amount of independent, empirical research has been               completed to date to link the enforcement efforts of OSHA to health             and safety in the workplace.                                                                                                                                    This project fills an important empirical gap by analyzing the                  underlying determinants of OSHA performance.  Specifically, this                study draws upon a data set which contains the complete records for             inspections conducted by OSHA from 1971 to June of 1991.  The                   analysis is pursued in two stages.  First, the study empirically                examines the relationship between different levels of enforcement               and firm-level compliance with specific health and safety                       standards.  Second, it measures the relationship between compliance             and health and safety outcomes, such as the incidence of workplace              injuries.  In addition to answering a number of questions                       concerning the efficacy of current methods of safety and health                 regulation, it advances general understanding of compliance                     behavior in enforcement based regulatory systems.  While analyses               to date typically assume perfect compliance with promulgated                    regulations, this study tests notions of regulatory performance                 from the perspective of limited enforcement and imperfect                       compliance.",
