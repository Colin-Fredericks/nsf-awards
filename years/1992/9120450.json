 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manatees are endangered species of the Order Sirenia and exhibit                several unusual traits in brain anatomy which appear to be                      related to their unique lifestyle. Manatees have an annual death                rate of approximately 150 individuals from a total population of                about 1500-2000. This fact, coupled with their slow reproductive                replacement rate, leads to the real possibility exists that we                  are witnessing the last opportunity to study the biology of these               unique mammals.                                                                                                                                                 Each mammalian species represents an \"experiment\" by nature and                 every unusual species helps define the range of possible                        evolutionary outcomes, increases our understanding of                           evolutionary potential, and enables the reconstruction of the                   evolutionary history of the brain.  At present, we have some                    understanding of how certain peculiar features of manatee brains                may be correlated with their unique ecological niche; for                       example, the small brain/body-weight ratio, smooth cerebral                     hemispheres, and low cell densities in the cortex.  The present                 research will enable the identification of different cortical                   areas in the manatee based on cellular staining patterns and will               suggest functional roles for these regions through comparisons                  with other mammalian species. Computer-generated three-                         dimensional reconstructions of cerebral hemispheres  and                        determination of the volumes of the major brain divisions are                   also major objectives.",
