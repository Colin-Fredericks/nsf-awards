 "awd_abstract_narration": "This supplement provides funding for a pilot Teacher                       Enhancement Project at Northeastern University.  The project                    involves establishing the Center for the Enhancement of Science and             Mathematics Education (CESAME).  This Center will be organized                  within the framework of the Industry/University Cooperative                     Research Center (I/UCRC) model developed by NSF.  CESAME will                   differ in one major way from a conventional IUC in that to date                 IUCs have focused upon fostering research projects conducted by                 scientists and engineers working in technological areas relevant to             industry.  CESAME will be concerned with fostering projects                     conducted by teachers and other parties concerned with enhancing K-             12 education.  By applying the IUC approach to education, CESAME                will systematically disseminate results and nurture the development             of \"teacher-mentors\".  These leaders are vitally needed to spark                widespread positive changes in the country's educational system.                Another important facet of the proposed Center is the melding of                state resources with those of federal and industrial partners.  The             Bay State Skills Corporation (BSSC) and the Massachusetts                       Corporation for Educational Telecommunications (MCET) will be                   active participants in CESAME.  This mixture of state, federal and              private sector participation is critical in an area such as pre-                college education.                                                                   The Program Director recommends Northeastern University be                 awarded $100,000 for the first year of this pilot Teacher                       Enhancement Project.  This project is being co-funded ($50,000) by              the Education and Human Resources Directorate, Teacher Enhancement              Program.                                                                             Near the end of the first year the Program Director will                   review the progress of the Center on a number of criteria,                      including the following:  (1) the extent to which the university-               industry interaction is developing; (2) the extent to which the                 support base of $100,000 is met and expanded; (3) the extent to                 which a robust educational program is developing.  If the review is             satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend support of the                second year of this continuing award.",
