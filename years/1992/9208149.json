 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dispersal is a major life history characteristic composed of many               interacting traits.  Most arguments about the evolution of                      dispersal patterns assume that there is significant genetic                     variation for these traits and that they covary genetically with                other traits influenced by natural selection.  A major difficulty               in understanding the evolution of dispersal patterns has been the               inability to quantify individual differences in those biological                parameters contributing to dispersal potential.  In the marine                  slipper snail, Crepidula fornicata, the principal biological trait              governing dispersal capacity is the duration of a free-swimming                 larval stage.  Larval of Crepidula must develop in the plankton for             one to several weeks before becoming capable of metamorphosing to               the sedentary  juvenile stage.  This period of obligatory dispersal             can now be quantified for individual larvae.  The study will                    determine the quantitative genetic covariance with other larval and             post-metamorphic traits that have been previously proposed to                   influence the development of metamorphic competence and fitness                 variation, and will specifically test the hypothesis that dispersal             capacity may evolve through its genetic correlation with other                  traits that are subject to natural selection.  The study will                   contribute to the increased understanding of the biology of marine              shellfish populations, and populations of other intertidal and                  estuarine species.",
