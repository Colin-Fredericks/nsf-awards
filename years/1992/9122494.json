 "awd_abstract_narration": "Consumer products often carry warranties which are either one-             dimensional (indexed by time in service or amount of usage) or two-             dimensional (indexed by both of these variables).  The focus of                 this project is on two-dimensional warranties, virtually an                     unaddressed topic.                                                                   The warranty scenario raises at least two classes or research              issues:  the specification of an optimum price/warranty                         combination, and the forecast of a reserve fund to meet future                  claims.  The former is multidisciplinary, involving aspects of                  economics, game theory, marketing, operations research, and                     probabilistic modeling.  The latter involves the analysis of time               series and point processes in two dimensions, for which the use of              Bayesian methods is appropriate.  This project addresses the                    following aspects of these issues.                                                   1.  Formalization of the first issue to facilitate                         mathematical development of the individual pieces.                                   2.  Development of probabilistic models for the occurrence of              events (failures) indexed by time and usage.                                         3.  Renewal theory for points in a plane generated by the                  models developed.                                                                    4.  Development of meaningful utility functions based on                   subjective probability considerations which describe the                        competitive behavior between manufacturers and consumers, and                   between manufacturers.                                                               5.  Development of a technology for undertaking times series               analysis in two dimensions.                                                          6.  Statistical inference for point processes in a plane.                       Although all aspects of the project are motivated by the                   warranty problem, items 2, 3, 5, and 6 have scientific merit of                 their own and will provide new tools for the decision sciences.",
