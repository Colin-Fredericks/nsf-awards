 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a renewal proposal for a three-year NSF grant.  We                      propose to develop an operational three-dimensional                             magnetospheric B-field model for Earth's magnetosphere which                    responds to changes in the solar wind and interplanetary field                  conditions, and to changes in the plasma conditions within the                  magnetotail and ring-current regions.  The new model                            approximately satisfies the MHD equilibrium condition; it is                    time-dependent on the quasi-static time scale.  We aim at                       developing a user-friendly FORTAN code which can be used by the                 scientific community upon request.                                              The proposed work is important, because most available three-                   dimensional B-field models for Earth's magnetosphere are rather                 limited: they represent only \"average\" magnetospheric conditions                (e.g., ordered with respect to the Kp index).  B-field models                   much more flexible are needed for simulating critical                           magnetospheric situations, such as highly stretched tail field                  lines in the late state of the substorm expansion phase, or                     \"collapsed\" magnetotail field lines following a neutral sheet                   reconnection event.  Also, field-aligned Birkeland currents and                 boundary conditions of the \"open\" magnetosphere need to be well                 represented.                                                                    We propose to achieve such a goal by developing a second-                       generation code of the so-called Hilmer-Voigt magnetospheric                    magnetic field model \u0131Hilmer, 1989!; that model has been                        designed, coded, and tested under the previous NSF grant (with                  the additional help from other funding as well).  A preliminary                 version of the Hilmer-Voigt model is presently being used in                    connection with the \"Rice Convection Model\" and the                             \"Magnetospheric Specification Model\".  The experience gained                    through those \"applications\" has led us to propose some major                   physical improvements  which include the following:                             (1) Replace the existing magnetopause by a flexible shape which                 responds to the solar wind ram thermal pressures.                               (2) Include magnetopause boundary conditions for an \"open\"                      magnetosphere.                                                                  (3) Provide the computational tools to include field-aligned                    Birkeland currents.                                                             (4) Use Stern's stretch transformations to make the magnetotail                 and ring currents approximately consistent with the requirement                 of quasi-static MHD force balance.                                              The proposed work is not a narrow or limited task| We claim that                a user-friendly flexible B-field model that responds to a                       variety of physical input parameters is a significant achievement               for magnetospheric physics, in that it provides us with a                       versatile research tool for both data analysis and theoretical                  studies.",
