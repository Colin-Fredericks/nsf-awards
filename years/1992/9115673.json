 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbial growth and respiratory rates vary seasonally at all                   non-tropical latitudes.  In addition, based on results from the                 PI's ongoing research, the minimal requirement for substrates by                bacteria also varies seasonally.  The interaction of these two                  factors results in a dramatic decrease in microbial food web                    activity at the time of the local minimum temperature.  This is                 a transient condition and can be attenuated by a rise in                        temperature and/or increase in organic substrates, either                       directly or via zooplankton grazing.  Results of ongoing                        research, over three spring bloom periods in Conception Bay,                    Newfoundland demonstrated that microbial loop activity is greatly               diminished at the beginning to mid-bloom, increasing either after               the bloom ceases (1986, 1990) or toward the end of a bloom that                 is extended by physical mixing so that zooplankton grazing                      intensifies (1988).  Data from the U.S. southeastern continental                shelf suggest that this concept applies to the subtropical ocean                as well. In many continental shelf regions this transient period                may represent the only autotrophic (primary production exceeds                  community respiration) period of the year.  The length of this                  event becomes critical to the functioning of the system over the                entire year.  Even moderate global warming of surface waters                    could have a substantial impact on the organic nutrient status of               the region.  A combination of observations and experiments at                   sea, from high to subtropical latitudes, together with                          experimental studies, using bacterial and protozoan isolates in                 the laboratory, will help us define the combined effects of water               temperature and substrate availabilities.  These results should                 be of particular value in predicting the effect of global warming               on marine food webs.",
