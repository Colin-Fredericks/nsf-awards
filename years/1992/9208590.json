 "awd_abstract_narration": "When two aqueous solutions of water soluble polymer such as                     PEG and dextran are mixed together, above critical                              concentrations, a liquid-liquid phase separation occurs.  A                     similar situation occurs when PEG and salt are mixed together.                  Proteins or enzymes added to either of the resulting two phase                  mixtures will tend to partition unequally between the two                       phases, thus allowing for the extraction of a particular                        protein.                                                                                                                                                        Over the past three years, in collaboration with Professor                      Kula of the Institute for Enzymetechnology in Julich, West                      Germany, and under the auspices of an NSF grant (CBT-872084),                   the PI has been developing a statistical mechanical theory for                  aqueous two phase partitioning, and has been undertaking                        complementary experiments on the phase behavior of the PEG/Dx                   system.  The experimentation involved the careful assemblage                    of phase equilibria diagrams, and the identification of the                     interfacial tension between the two phases as a sensitive                       indicator of composition.  Theoretically, simple models of                      polymer-polymer, polymer-protein, ion-ion, protein-protein,                     protein-ion and polymer-ion interactions have been developed                    which can be used to calculate potentials of mean force in                      water.  The proposed research suggests additional theoretical                   work along the same lines.  The mean force potentials which                     have been developed are to be used to obtain the radial                         distribution function via the closure postulation of the                        integral equation technique.  From the radial distribution                      function, thermodynamic properties can be obtained, and phase                   separations behavior identified.  These calculations will be                    supplemented by Gibbs Monte-Carlo computer simulations of the                   phase equilibria.  These simulations will allow verification                    of the equilibria obtained by the integral equation route, and                  will provide a method for obtaining phase equilibria for which                  the integral equation approach proves inadequate.  Simulations                  and integral phase equilibria calculations will be carried out                  to develop theories capable of predicting phase equilibria in                   polymer/polymer and polymer/salt mixtures, and the segregation                  g of proteins including multiple protein partitioning and                       possibly the effect of affinity ligands attached to the                         polymer molecule.. Complementary experiments on protein                         partitioning will also be undertaken.",
