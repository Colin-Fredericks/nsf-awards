 "awd_abstract_narration": "Five years ago the University of California's Bodega Marine                     Laboratory instituted a series of colloquia, during which experts               in timely fields were assembled for an exchange of ideas on current             research and to participate in extensive public discussions on the              topic of the colloquium. The colloquia are widely advertised and                have been well attended by participants from all over the world.                This proposal is for partial support for the fifth colloquium in                this series. Previous colloquia have been published, a practice                 which the organizers of the proposed one intend to continue.                                                                                                    We will assemble many of the world leaders whose research focuses               on the stabilization of macromolecules under a variety of                       conditions. The focus of the meeting is specifically on \"compatible             solutes\" and their roles in stabilization. The speakers are chosen              from far-flung fields, including food science, biochemistry,                    biophysics, animal and plant physiology, physics and chemistry.                 Because this subject has clear applications in \"the real world\",                participants from industry and Federal government are included in               the program. Being an interdisciplinary meeting, many of the                    participants have never met and may not even be aware of each                   other's work. It is unlikely that the scientists chosen to                      participate in this colloquium would be assembled at a regular                  scientific meeting. Thus, a major aim is to generate discussion and             interaction that would not likely otherwise occur, on a topic of                basic and applied importance.",
