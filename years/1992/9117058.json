The project will focus on the mechanism by                     which plants and algae are capable of adjusting both the size of                their photosynthetic units in photosystem-II (PSII) and photosystem-            I (PSI), as well as the ratio of PSII/PSI in response to differences            in the quality of illumination.  Such ajustments constantly optimize            the photosynthetic capability of whole plants or plant parts and                even whole ecosystems.  This is a very important question.                                                                                                      The collaboration will help combine the use of resources in                     elucidating the molecular mechanism that regulates photosystem                  stoichiometry adjustments in chloroplasts.  In particular, the                  research will address the processes of signal perception and signal             transduction in the chloroplasts leading to photosystem                         stoichiometry adjustments, and on different aspects of the                      regulation of gene expression by light-quality and nutrient                     availability in photosynthetic prokaryotes and higher plants.",
