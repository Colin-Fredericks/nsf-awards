 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will conduct research on the problems lying               on the interface between continuum physics and the theory of                    hyperbolic systems of conservation laws.  One project will                      involve employing the method of generalized characteristics to                  study regularity, large time behavior and propagation of                        singularities in solutions of quasilinear hyperbolic systems that               may or may not be in conservative form.  Another project will                   consist of a systematic study of the admissibility of wave fans                 in systems of conservation laws, modeling specific physical                     phenomena, in which the issue of admissibility is still                         unresolved either due to the presence of phase boundaries or                    because strict hyperbolicity fails.  Finally, a third project                   will involve considering hierarchies of systems of conservation                 laws, like those generated by the Boltzmann equation or through                 \"extended thermodynamics,\" and studying the process by which                    simpler theories are embedded as special or limiting cases into                 more complex ones.                                                                   Continuum physics is founded on balance laws and                           constitutive relations.  The former determine the framework of                  the theory (for example, mechanics, thermodynamics,                             electrodynamics) while the latter identify the type of the                      continuous medium (for example, elastic, viscoelastic, solid,                   fluid).  The problems here concern media with \"elastic\" response                in which case the combination of balance laws and constitutive                  relations leads to quasilinear hyperbolic systems, commonly known               as hyperbolic systems of conservation laws.  Despite considerable               progress in the study of such systems over the past 25 years, the               basic goal of establishing existence, uniqueness, regularity and                large time behavior of admissible solutions has only been                       achieved partially in the case of one space dimension and remains               entirely unfulfilled in higher space dimensions.  Progress in the               field requires understanding a combination of continuum physics,                mathematical analysis, and scientific computation.",
