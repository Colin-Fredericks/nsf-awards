 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic problem Wermer will study is the description of all              commuting algebras of operators on a finite dimensional Hilbert                 space in which the k-fold von Neumann inequality holds for all k.               A second part of the project will be to generalize the results of               Alexander, Slodkowski, Forstneric and others on the polynomial hull             of a set in C^2 lying over the unit circle S, to the corresponding              problem when S is replaced by the boundary of the unit ball in C^2.                  The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently                being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
