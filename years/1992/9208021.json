 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is directed at understanding the ability of common                arid region plants to utilize summer precipitation events and the               consequences of different water sources for growth and for the                  efficiency of dry matter production.  Preliminary data indicate                 that several of the dominant perennial species in the Intermountain             West appear not to utilize summer precipitation, even though summer             rain is a major component of the annual water input to these                    ecosystems.  It is proposed to examine several hypotheses related               to a plant's utilization of summer precipitation and how this                   relates to the efficiency of biomass production along a gradient of             increasing summer precipitation.  Research will be centered on                  using stable isotope analyses to determine both water sources and               efficiency of dry matter production.  Field studies will be                     conducted at five sites, which range from 15% to 52% summer                     precipitation, but which are otherwise similar in total                         precipitation and temperature.  The study will focus on dominant                tree-subtree species in the ecosystem transitional between desert               and temperate forest ecosystems: Juniper (Juniperus osteosperma),               pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) and scrub oak (Quercus gambelii).  There             is strong potential for applied aspects of the proposed research.               Stable isotope analyses provide integrated long-term estimates of               plant parameters involving water use and efficiency of dry matter               production.  The information and techniques derived from this study             will be useful in determining the kinds of characters to be used                for evaluation of forest timber and pulp species.  Foresters and                agronomists are already beginning to use these stable isotope                   approaches for integrated analyses of different genetic lines.",
