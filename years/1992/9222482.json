 "awd_abstract_narration": "Study will be made of trace element scavenging mechanisms and                   particle dynamics through measurements of temporal variations in                dissolved, suspended particulate and sinking particulate elemental              distributions during a two year time-series study in the northeast              Pacific.  A recently-developed in situ pump will be used for                    collection of contamination-free size-fractionated samples of                   suspended matter throughout the water column.  Five occupations of              a deep-water station in the California Current will sample three                seasons of varying productivity.  This sampling will be coupled                 with simultaneous sediment trap and dissolved element measurements              to examine the effect of changing productivity and vertical mass                flux on the overall distribution of trace elements in a productive              eastern boundary water column.  Samples of all three pools will be              analyzed for Al, Fe, Ca, Si, Mn, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd, Ba, I, U, and              232Th.  This research will address the shortage of fundamental                  information on the distribution of particulate trace elements which             currently limits formulation of realistic scavenging models.  The               chemical differences in the behavior of elements will be used as                probes of the scavenging process, as illustrated by our previous                measurements of a subset of these elements in samples from Bermuda,             the Northeast Atlantic, and the Northeast Pacific.  In addition,                elemental composition of particulate matter will be used as a                   tracer of mass exchange among particulate pools.",
