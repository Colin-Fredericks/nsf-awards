 "awd_abstract_narration": "The male gametophyte, the haploid male plant in the life cycle of               flowering plants, plays an essential role by producing two sperm                cells and transporting them through the female tissues of the                   flower into the embryo sac where double fertilization occurs.  The              results from the previous NSF funded research have raised several               new and important questions with respect to the regulation of male              gametophyte development that form the basis of the present                      proposal.  Promoters of pollen-specific genes will be used to                   target in transgenic Arabidopsis plants the expression of several               specific genes to specific periods in pollen development.  The aim              is to over- and/or under-express the gene products in order to                  perturb development thus providing clues to their function.  The                genes selected are considered to have important roles in pollen                 development although the details of the processes controlled by                 them are not known.  Both repression of mRNA translation and mRNA               stability appear to be part of the spectrum of regulatory                       mechanisms operating in pollen development.  The cis-sequences in               pollen mRNAs required for these properties will be identified.  An              unusual repetitive sequence that is found in the 3' non-translated              end of several mRNAs present primarily in young microspores will                be investigated further.  In order to identify genes that play                  crucial regulatory roles in pollen development a search for T-DNA               tagged pollen defective mutants is being started.  This work will               significantly expand our knowledge about the mechanisms regulating              development of the male gametophyte.",
