 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will extend the PI's current investigations on                     chemical mediation of seaweed-herbivore and invertebrate-predator               interactions to include: (1) complex interactions of prey                       nutritional value with chemical and structural prey defenses, (2)               an understanding of how larval and spore defenses differ from those             of the adult, and why (exposure to different consumers?, increased              exposure to UV without adult structures that provide shade?, etc.),             and (3) the role of learned aversion by vertebrate versus                       invertebrate consumers in affecting both prey and consumer                      dynamics.  Because benthic seaweeds and invertebrates play a                    trophically and ecologically important role in near-shore                       communities and are rich sources of novel secondary metabolites                 that function as defenses against consumers and have potential                  applications as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and growth                      regulating substances, understanding how these organisms respond                chemically to ecological and environmental threats can provide                  fundamental information about how marine systems function, and can              suggest strategies for applied uses of marine natural products.",
