 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in the study of locomotor performance allow us to               integrate the fields of behavior, physiology, and morphology to                 establish the relationship between performance limits and natural               locomotor activity.  The ghost crab, Ocypode quadrata, is                       particularly suited for such an integrative study.  Laboratory                  studies of ghost crab locomotion have led to specific predictions               about the speed and duration of natural movements.  To test these               predictions, the coPI will observe ghost crab locomotion in the                 field.  The coPI will videotape crabs moving in their natural                   habitat and perform motion analysis to determine the velocity,                  duration and frequency of their movements.  The coPI will test                  hypotheses about ghost crab locomotion predicted by continuous and              intermittent exercise physiology.  The field data collected in this             study will be integrated with laboratory measurements of locomotor              performance to determine where ghost crabs operate within their                 performance limits in nature.  Such studies provide a basic                     understanding of the extent to which material conditions of                     existence press organisms towards their physiological limits, and               therefore a basis for assessing effects of additional stresses due              to environmental changes caused by human activities.",
