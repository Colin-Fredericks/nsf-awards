 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temporal information processing underlies various kinds of                      intelligent behaviors, including hearing and vision.  A neural                  network framework for segmenting and recognizing complex temporal               patterns is proposed.  Processing of temporal segmentation is based             on the idea that segmentation is expressed by synchronization                   within each segment and desychronization among different segments.              Each segment becomes an input to the recognition network that                   explicitly encodes neighborhood or topological relations of local               features of the input, and recognition is based on the graph                    matching method.  To cope with problems embedded in time, the                   network to constructed codes time explicitly.  Multiple temporal                patterns are segregated into different segments that are activated              alternately in the time domain.  The network is able to recognize               complex temporal patterns, and recognition is invariant to                      distortions of time intervals (time warping) and to changes in the              rate of presentation .  The network will be tested for both neural              plausibility and computational effectiveness.  Results of this                  project will provide new computational principles that might be                 used by the brain to process temporal segmentation and recognition.             Also, they will provide effective methods for solving technical                 problems indispensable in real time continuous auditor pattern                  recognition.",
