A major objective involves quantifying and modelling how               flood magnitudes and recurrence frequencies differed between times              of climatic transition versus time of climatic extremes, and how                the relative direction of climatic change (e.g. warm/moist to                   warm/dry versus warm.moist to cool/moist etc.) influences flood                 magnitude and frequency characteristics.  Results of the research               will indicate how the shape and dispersion of a flood frequency                 distribution change with changes in the mean of a flood                         distribution.  The stratigraphic record of climate/flood                        associations will be compared with selected long historical                     climate/flood records from Europe and from the Yellow River system              of China.  The project provides important \"event scale\"                         understandings of linkages between climatic and hydrologic systems              that might be anticipated for future climatic conditions that have              been projected for various scenarios of atmospheric greenhouse gas              loadings.  This type of \"event scale\" information generally is not              available from present global atmospheric circulation models.",
