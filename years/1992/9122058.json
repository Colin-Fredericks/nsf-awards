 "awd_abstract_narration": "For centuries, hurricanes have been an important factor in                 the climate of the Gulf Coast region of the United States, and                  they play a major role in causing coastal landform changes, as                  ecological agents, and as hazards to life and property.                         Hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico region may be linked to                El Nino-Southern Oscillation events and to sub-Saharan droughts.                The short length of the documentary hurricane record together                   with the rarity of severe, category 4 and 5, hurricanes make it                 impossible to estimate the long-term frequency of such events.                  Reconstruction of the prehistoric record of hurricanes and the                  deciphering of long-term changes in hurricane activity depends on               proxy data which can be obtained from coastal lake sediments.                   This project seeks to demonstrate that coastal lake sediments                   preserve a stratigraphically and chronologically distinct record                of major hurricane strikes in the form of sand layers.  The proxy               for a number of sites will be correlated to identify temporal and               spatial variations in hurricane activity in the northern Gulf of                Mexico region, and these will be related to global events such as               El Nino and sub-Saharan droughts.                                                    This study promises to yield a comprehensive history of the                late-Holocene hurricane climate for the northern Gulf of Mexico                 region by extending previous research from a single site to lakes               and marshes across the entire region.  In this way, the                         documentary record of hurricanes can be extended back several                   millennia, and the frequency of occurrence of severe hurricanes                 can be estimated.  The research will employ radiometric dating of               lake sediment cores to identify hurricane events and to establish               a regional climatic signal.  This information will permit a                     comparison with other late-Holocene climatic changes from other                 parts of the world to further an understanding of global                        processes and regional linkages in the interdisciplinary study of               global change.",
