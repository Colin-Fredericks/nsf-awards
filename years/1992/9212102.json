 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Phillips will use behavioral techniques to examine the                      detection and use of the earth's magnetic field by the eastern                  newt (Notophthalmus viridescens).  Previous work has shown that                 the magnetic compass used by newts for shoreward orientation is                 influenced by the wavelength of light.  Measurements of the                     wavelength-dependence of magnetic compass orientation will be                   extended into the near-ultraviolet to better characterize the                   visual inputs that contribute to the magnetic compass.  In                      addition, the wavelength of light reaching the pineal organ and                 eyes will be selectively altered to find out if the light-                      dependent magnetic compass is located in one of these two                       photoreceptive organs.  To investigate the involvement of the                   magnetic field in homing and, more specifically, in the \"map\" or                geographic-position sense that is required for homing,                          experiments will be carried out to examine the effects of varying               the wavelength of light and of manipulating specific components                 of the magnetic field (i.e., the dip angle and total intensity)                 on homing orientation.                                                                                                                                          This research will contribute to a better understanding of the                  function of the pineal and of the processing of sensory                         information by the brain of vertebrates.  In addition, the                      information gained from this research will help to characterize                 the extent to which the visual system of amphibians has become                  specialized to perform specific sensory functions (i.e.,                        detection of the earth's magnetic field).  A more complete                      understanding of these specialized sensory functions will make it               possible to determine when the amphibian visual system can serve                as an appropriate model system for studying visual processes that               occur in other vertebrates, including humans.  Finally,                         investigation of the strategies used by amphibians to orient                    during long-distance movement will contribute to a better                       understanding of how the brain of vertebrates processes spatial                 information.",
