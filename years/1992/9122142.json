 "awd_abstract_narration": "New procedures for analyzing economic time series are developed                 using Bayesian methods of time series analysis and semiparametric               specification testing in cointegrated systems.  Empirical                       applications of these methods include analysis of data on                       macroeconomic time series for the United States economy,                        macroeconomic data for Korea, Australia and New Zealand, and some               long stock price and dividend series.  Extensive simulation                     experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the new                procedures.  The new estimation methods developed by this project               should improve the quality of empirical economic research on a                  wide range of problems.  The work is especially timely because of               the recent increase in interest in applying Bayesian methods, the               framework used by this project, to empirical economic research.                                                                                                 The main activity of the project is concerned with objective                    Bayesian methods of time series analysis.  Specific attention is                given to economic time series whose behavior indicates possible                 nonstationary characteristics.  Issues of determining model-based               reference priors that accommodate nonstationary will be                         considered in detail.  The effects of data conditioning in                      Bayesian time series analysis is the major focus of attention.                  The conceptual framework developed in the previous grant is                     extended to Bayes model likelihood tests, posterior odds tests                  and model selection criteria.  The model selection criteria                     provides a generalization of a widely used criterion.  All of                   these features of Bayesian                                                      inference are explored in detail and an asymptotic theory is                    developed for a general class of time series problems.                                                                                                          The work on semiparametric specification testing in cointegration               relies on the Lagrange multiplier (LM) principle.  The LM                       approach delivers a model specification test for the long-run                   elements of a structural system and tests against both                          underspecification (too few long-run relations) and                             overspecification (too many long-run relations).  The two parts                 of the project will be related by developing a Bayes model                      specification test which, in the case of cointegrated systems,                  will be closely related to the LM test procedure.",
