 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blum         Distributing multiple sensors over some region for the  purpose of detecting a signal in noise is becoming increasingly  attractive. The majority of the research work concerning the  design of such schemes has focused on signal detection problems  where a complete observation model which categorizes the  environment under consideration is known. This research deals  with distributed detection schemes for cases where a complete  observation model is not available due to incomplete knowledge of  the operating environment. This is an extremely practical case  which has applications in air traffic control, radar weather  monitoring, and other radar and sonar systems. Robustness results  for important cases with alternative hypothesis which are not  simple, finite observation sample sizes, dependent observations,  and non-additive observations are being sought. The plan to  construct these schemes focuses on applying the theory of minimax  robust statistics.  Cases with nonstationary, possibly non-  Gaussian background environments and possibly dependent  observations are also being investigated.",
