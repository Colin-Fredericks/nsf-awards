 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embryology and developmental biology are increasingly                           prominent in modern evolutionary biology.  Many                                 advocates of the importance of development argue that                           the processes of organic growth produce constraints on                          adaptive evolution.  This approach contrasts with                               \"adaptationism,\" a feature of mainstream neo-Darwinian                          evolutionary biology that emphasizes natural selection                          and the particular adaptations-to-environment it                                produces.  Adaptationism is said by its critics to                              ignore the structural processes of development which                            are common to large groups of organisms and which                               produce non-adaptational similarities.  Dr. Amundson is                         examining the methodological basis of the adaptation-                           versus-constraint debates from an historical                                    perspective.  A remarkably similar debate occurred                              among pre-Darwinian British biologists, between natural                         theologians and continental style morphologists and                             comparative anatomists.  Comparisons between the two                            debates suggest that the contrast between adaptational                          and structural biological explanation is not a special                          feature of evolutionary biology at all.  The                                    methodological similarities will contribute to a better                         understanding of the current debates and a better                               understanding of the diverse explanatory strategies                             used in biological science.",
