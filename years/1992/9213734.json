 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be concerned with theoretical elementary                     particle physics.  From particle accelerators a great deal has                  been learned about the fundamental behavior of the quarks that                  compose protons even though the quarks have never escaped from                  protons.  However, calculations show that at extremely high                     temperatures (1010 times room temperature) and extremely high                   densities (1015 times normal), protons will melt into a fluid                   composed of unconfined quarks.  These conditions occurred in                    the very early universe and will be recreated in accelerators                   now being built to collide heavy nucleii.  This project is                      intended to help develop reliable methods for calculating the                   behavior of quarks and gluons under these extreme conditions.                   This is important to our efforts to achieve an understanding                    of the early universe and of the behavior of nuclear matter at                  high temperatures and densities.",
