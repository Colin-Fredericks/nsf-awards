 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to investigate two lesser classes of molluscs,             the Aplacophora and the Polyplacophora, using electron                          microscopy to ellucidate a new set of characters for the heart-                 kidney complex to use in the analysis of molluscan phylogeny.                   Both classes have been placed near the roots of the various                     phylogenetic trees that depict the origin of the molluscan classes.             Studies proposed will include anatomical relationships not yet                  determined, as well as patterns of new characters.  With access to              living organisms and ultrastructural fixation of the heart-kidneq               complex, identified specific characters to be studied will be: 1)               heart musculature, 2) ultrafiltration sites, 3) pericardial epithelium          and its contractility, 4) hemocyanin blood pigment, 5) pore cells in            the pericardial tissues, 6) relationships of the coelomic body                  caviites with the coelomducts (kidneys), and 7) secretory and                   absorptive cells in the kidneys.  The patterns found in                         representatives of these two phyla will be compared to what is                  known in the better-studied classes of molluscs to establish                    character polarity between primitive and derived states.  These                 findings, along with what is known in the out group phyla                       associated with the Mollusca (especially the phylum Sipuncula) will             contribute to the eventual formulation of a parsimonious phylogeny              of the phylum Mollusca.                                                               This research will focus on the systematic biology of                     molluscs, reflecting new techniques and new thinking in                         approaches to investigations of the evolution of molluscs.  These               include analyses of data by looking for relatedness between taxa,               understanding and weighing whether a character is primitive                     (plesiomorphic) or derived (apomorphic), establishing shared                    characters between large and small groups of organisms, utiliizing              electron microscopy to investigate characters at the cellular and               tissue level, and seeking relatedness as expressed in the genetic               code.                                                                                 The effort furthers VPW program objectives to provide                     opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    lecturing in two undergraduate courses (an advanced                             undergraduate course in invertebrate zoology, and a field course                in natural history of the Washington coast), and interacting in the             laboratory component of each class; offering a seminar on Marine                Biodiversity for graduate students; organizing faculty/student \"bag             lunch\" meetings to highlight issues facing women in science;                    helping to establish a visiting woman scientist program; and                    working with students on research projects.",
