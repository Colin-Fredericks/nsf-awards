 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year of a two-year continuing award.  The                  research focuses on the development of novel image description                  operators based on the notion of Gaussian Wavelet Groups (GWG).                 These groups are synthesized in clusters that have high cojoint                 spatial-frequency resolution and are also efficient in detection                and localization of shapes directly from gray-scale images.                     Specialized GWGs will be developed that are capable of measuring                various shape descriptors such as location, orientation, size and               boundary curvature.  The GWGs will be generated in real time by                 novel lattice networks.  To describe whole shapes, a novel                      topological structure called a scale-spinal-graph (SSG) will be                 developed, along with a network that can generate the SSG with                  parallel operations.  The project will also develop an efficient                image representation scheme using clusters of GWGs, for real time               image compression.",
