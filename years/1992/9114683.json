 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports one visit in the first year by Dr. Simon C.                 Moss, and one by post-doctoral researcher P.C. Chow, of the                     University of Houston, University Park, and one each in the                     second year, to CSIRO, Clayton, Victoria, Australia, to work with               Dr. Stephen W. Wilkins of the Division of Materials Science and                 Technology on the Division of Materials Science and Technology on               the x-ray microstructural characterization of thin films and                    multilayers of semiconductors produced by various means.  The                   researchers intend to select a few materials for intensive study                and join their respective instrumental and theoretical skills to                develop new insights and analytical methods.  The research topics               include:  (1) semiconductor multilayer (superlattice) structures;               (2) studies of interfaces in incoherent structures; and (3)                     studies of ordering, vibrational effects and localized                          distortions within multilayer and thin-film structures.  The                    three topics are somewhat interrelated in that they require very                careful attention to data collection and to scattering theory.",
