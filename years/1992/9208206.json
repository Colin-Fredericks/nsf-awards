 "awd_abstract_narration": "To understand how large populations of neurons function, the               investigator will develop mathematical tools for describing and                 analyzing collective network behavior.  Models that account for                 the spatial and temporal structure of firing patterns in large                  neural populations will be developed and studied.   Population                  behavior will be tied to and derived from the electrical and                    geometric properties of individual neurons.  Reduction methods                  will be used to streamline the analysis while retaining varying                 degrees of detail.   New developments in cable theory will be                   used to explore the effects of dendritic structure and synaptic                 placement on input integration.  A newly developed reduction                    scheme for conductance-based neuron models will allow the                       dynamics of ionic currents to be included and reflected in                      spiking rates and patterns.  Both firing-rate models and models                 that explore the temporal structure of population firing will be                investigated.  Almost all of the cognitive functions in the brain               are performed by large population of neurons working                            collectively.  To understand how these cognitive processes work                 requires developing techniques for describing and analyzing the                 behavior of large neuronal populations.  This project will use                  mathematical and statistical methods to study the dynamics of                   large populations of neurons, focusing in particular on the                     problem of extending knowledge about the properties of single                   neurons and their synaptic connections to full neural networks.",
