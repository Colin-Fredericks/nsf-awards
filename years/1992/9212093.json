 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Ogle is examining the history of a ubiquitous household                     technology, plumbing, as a way to document the larger relationship              between social and cultural values and the process of technological             change.  Americans use more plumbing and use it more often than                 virtually any other people in the world.  Clearly, the history of               plumbing deserves study because of the role it plays in our lives               and what it illustrates about American culture.  Further, the                   history of this ubiquitous technology has never before been                     extensively studied.                                                                                                                                            Dr. Ogle has found that what was originally seen as a mere                      convenience became, through the work of \"sanitarians,\" a necessity.             Originally plumbing was not sold as a technology for hygiene and                sanitation but as a \"labor saving device.\"  Because it was a                    convenience, there was no legal or social pressure to place running             water and water fixtures in every home.  Only when Americans began              to fear germs did they treat plumbing as an essential part of                   household hygiene.  This reaction led first to a rejection of the               old plumbing technology which, sanitarians argued, carried germs                through the household because the water was unsafe and because                  gases from the household sewer systems were likely to back up into              the house (or explode|). The old technology was replaced by new                 plumbing technologies; new health regulations were established to               insure the safety of the systems; and \"safe\" new municipal water                and sewer systems were constructed to provide a new level of                    hygiene in the household.                                                                                                                                       Dr. Ogle is examining books and magazines, patents and newspapers               in order to elaborate how changing cultural values affect                       technology.  She is also examining diaries and household account                books, architectural drawings and municipal documents such as water             and health department reports, sewer permits, and plumbing                      inspection reports to provide further documentation of these                    changes. With all these sources in hand, she will be able to                    provide a clear explanation of how and why plumbing technology was              shaped in the United States to take the form it has assumed today.",
