 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discovering the fundamental vision-motion primitives that are                used by people to navigate and manipulate objects would lead to a               natural human-machine interface for programming robotic systems                 especially in unstructured environments.  In this proposal, we                  begin exploring the definition of a set of natural robotic                      interface commands used for navigation.  A more natural                         navigational interface would allow robots to be more easily                     integrated into applications such as material handling for                      flexible manufacturing, planetary or underwater exploration, or                 automated wheelchairs.  The programmer issues a command such as                 \"go there\" to the robot by specifying \"there\" as a location on a                video screen.  The robot then navigates to the desired location                 on a video screen.  The robot then navigates to the desired                     location, avoiding any obstacles along the way.  As a tool for                  discovering a complete set of navigational commands, we will                    implement and experiment with an initial set of commands.  This                 experimentation should show where our initial command set is                    redundant or lacking and is essential for insuring that the                     commands are natural for the user.  As part of this research, we                will be developing a vision algorithm that can extract visually                 distinctive features from a wide variety of objects.  The command               set and the algorithms for feature extraction and tracking will                 be the largest contribution of this work.  Future work involves                 further testing of the navigational commands on a convenient test               platform and extending the methodology derived for discovering                  the primitive navigation commands to deriving manipulation                      commands.//",
