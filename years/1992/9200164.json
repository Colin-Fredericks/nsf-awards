The funds provide support for eight                    undergraduate students selected from candidates from nine colleges              in Kentucky.  Students participate in weekly seminars to discuss                progress in their research, receive information of career                       opportunities, be exposed to recent advances in the literature in               their fields of research.  Undergraduate students will have the                 opportunity to attend professional conferences in their respective              fields throughout the year, and will be encouraged to participate               in the annual Regional Undergraduate Chemistry Research Poster                  Competition.  Students participate in graduate research supervised              by one of seven participating professors on various topics in the               general area of membrane science.   Students are selected for                   participation on the basis of grade point average, nomination by                their home institution, and an essay on interest in the program and             career goals.  Emphasis is placed on recruitment from under-                    represented groups, for example, minorities, women, and handicapped             persons.",
