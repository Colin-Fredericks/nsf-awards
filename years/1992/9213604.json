Articulatory data acquired                  with the use of a real-time electropalatographic (EPG) system                   will be used to examine temporal patterns of tongue-palate                      contact in producing consonant clusters with the goal of                        describing coproduction of the underlying articulatory gestures.                Acoustic data collected simultaneously will be analyzed to                      determine the spectral consequences of the timing of articulatory               events as evidenced in the EPG data.  Specifically, this                        dissertation will address the following questions.  1) What is                  the effect of speaking rate on the coproduction of consonants in                sequence?  2) What changes occur in coproduction of consonantal                 gestures as the number of consonants in a sequence is varied?  3)               Does the spatial and/or temporal pattern of tongue-palate contact               vary as a function of the linear order of the consonants in the                 cluster; that is, does an alveolar                                              different than a velar                                                          location of word boundaries in a consonant sequence affect the                  temporal overlap between the gestures?  It is anticipated that                  this research will provide significant empirical data with which                various models of speech production can be further explicated to                more accurately mirror articulatory coproduction and temporal                   organization.",
