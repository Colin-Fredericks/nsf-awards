 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this three-year project, experienced field researchers,                      guided by an advisory committee of leaders of the American                      mathematics and science education reform movement, will                         conduct intensive case studies of eight major reform                            innovations of the 1980s.  The innovations include: the NCTM                    standards project, Project 2061, the Urban Mathematics                          Collaborative, California's systemic reform of science                          education, Chemistry in the Community, Voyage of the Mimi,                      Kids Network, and Contemporary PreCalculus Through                              Applications.  Simultaneously, coordinated through the Center                   for Education Research and Innovation (CERI) of the                             Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),                   parallel sets of case studies of elementary and secondary                       reform efforts in mathematics, science, and technology                          education will be undertaken in about 14 countries in Europe                    and Asia.  (The other nations will cover the research project                   costs in their own countries.)  Overall integration of the                      studies will be handled by an international steering                            committee.  Such integration will involve the use of a common                   analytical scheme and interpretive framework, and will result                   in a major conference and summary volume in which all results                   will be reported in a form suitable for dissemination to the                    educational research and policy communities.  In addition,                      there will be a published book-length report for each nation,                   coordinated through CERI, that will give full detail on the                     studies of each country.                                                                                                                                        These cross-national studies should aid policy makers in the                    U.S. and other nations in learning from the experience of                       other systems in setting and refining national goals.  This                     grant is co-funded by NSF and the Department of Education                       (Office of Educational Research and Improvement), with funds                    from NSF covering primarily the U.S. case studies and funds                     from OERI devoted primarily to the integration and                              interpretation of the cross-national perspective.",
