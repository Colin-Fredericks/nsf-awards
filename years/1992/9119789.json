 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structural studies will be carried out on the                                   quinoprotein-electron transfer system methylamine dehydrogenase                 (MADH) from Paracoccus denitrificans by the methods of x-ray                    diffraction.  Three proteins are involved in this system, MADH,                 amicyanin and cytochrome c551i.  MADH is a dimer of 124 kDa and                 contains the unusual cofactor tryptophan tryptophylquinone.                     Amicyanin is a blue copper protein of 12.5 kDa which interacts                  specifically with MADH.  Cytochrome c551i is a 22 kDa protein                   which accepts electrons from amicyanin and transfers them via                   another cytochrome to a terminal oxidase.                                                                                                                       Crystals have been prepared of MADH, amicyanin, the binary                      complex of MADH with amicyanin and of the ternary complex of                    MADH, amicyanin and cytochrome c551i.  The structures of MADH and               the binary complex have been solved by molecular replacement to                 2.8 A and 2.5 A resolution, respectively.  The structures of the                remaining crystal types and of the cytochrome by itself will be                 determined.  The structures of all crystal types will be refined                by simulated annealing and energy minimization.  These structures               will be carefully analyzed using molecular graphics to determine                the catalytic mechanisms and details of the electron transfer                   processes.",
