 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine geological and geophysical studies of the Ross Sea and                   Weddell Sea continental shelves provide evidence that the ice sheet             grounded near the shelf edge in these areas during the late                     Wisconsinan, and that the retreat of the ice sheet to its present               position was rapid and probably episodic.  This Award supports a                project which will establish the most recent (late Wisconsin-                   Holocene) history of ice sheet advance and retreat in Ross Sea.                 The objectives include: 1) reconstruction the late Wisconsin                    paleodrainage regime, including ice stream divides; 2)                          reconstruction of former grounding zone positions; 3) constraint                of the timing of ice sheet retreat from the shelf; and 4)                       acquisition of geophysical, sedimentological, and paleontological               data which may provide indicators the environmental factors that                may have influenced to ice sheet retreat.  This is a joint effort               between Rice University, the University of Colorado, and Hamilton               College.  The project involves experts in a wide variety of fields,             and will interface with glaciologists, physical oceanographers and              climatologists who will address the problem of ice sheet stability              and the record of climatic and glaciological change.",
