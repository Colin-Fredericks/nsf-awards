This has provided a unique natural experiment to                  examine the organization of entire stream communities.  The major                                                                                               objectives of this research are:1) to utilize this natural                      experiment as well as manipulative experiments, to assess                       mechanisms by which this dominant species affects the structure                 of trout stream food webs, 2) to determine the extent to which                  communities dominated by this species represent stable community                                                                                                configurations; and 3) to study the important processes                         regulating the abundances of this dominant consumer.  The PIs                   will monitor responses (composition and abundances, biomass, and                                                                                                growth rates) of all trophic levels to the treatments created by                                                                                                the natural experiment.  A powerful feature of the natural                      experiment is that essentially identical food web perturbations                 have been experienced at a series of diverse sites, with a                      variety of environmental characteristics (e.g., stream size,                    trophic structure, physical/chemical attributes).  Thus, the                    results should have considerable general applicability.                         Manipulative experiments will be performed to:1) determine the                  pathways and strengths by which interactions stemming from the                  dominant consumer affect the remainder of the community; and 2)                 identify the processes regulating the abundances of the dominant                                                                                                consumer.  By utilizing this combination of approaches, this                    project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the                       mechanisms structuring coldwater stream communities and the                     stability of stream communities.  This study will be one of the                 first to document the role of parasites in the population                       dynamics of lotic invertebrates.",
