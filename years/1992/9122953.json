The proposed research has the following goals:                       (1) performing a detailed comparative study of the external,                    genitalic, and internal reproductive morphology of representatives              of all agrypnine genera; (2) performing cladistic analysis to                   establish a hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships of agrypnine               genera; and (3) using the phylogenetic hypothesis of agrypnine                  generic relationships as the basis for: (a) taxonomic                           classification of the tribe; and (b) analysis of area relationships             in this tribe.  The Agrypnini is distributed worldwide, with                    several large widespread genera and a number of smaller genera                  endemic to one region.  The biogeographical analysis will compare               results from biogeographical parsimony analysis, component                      analysis, and quantification of component analysis.  Funds are                  requested for travel to major European entomological museum for                 examination of material for morphological studies and cladistic                 analysis, and for scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  SEM will be              used to examine, interpret, and illustrate micromorphological                   characters, especially the mouthparts and ultrastructure of setal               scales.  The proposed research will provide additional character                systems for comparison with other elaterid taxa, will provide                   biogeographical patterns for comparison with unrelated taxa, and                will compare efficacy of biogeographical analysis methodologies.",
