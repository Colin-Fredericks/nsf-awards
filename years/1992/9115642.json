 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pi of this project has devised a technique for estimating                   virtually the instantaneous rate of production for eucaryotic                   marine microbial organo-osmotrophs (eumycotic fungi), analogous to              those previously available for procaryotic organo-osmotrophs.  This             method, which is in in the Journal ECOLOGY, represents a                        technological breakthrough; it promises to permit the first                     estimates of fungal productivity in ocean-edge ecosystems, the                  portion of the marine environment wherein fungi are likely to have              their greatest impact on carbon flow, from vascular plants to                   marine food webs.  The technique (abbreviated as Ac-ERG) involves               measuring the incorporation of radio-labeled acetate into the                   (nearly) uniquely fungal sterol, ergosterol.  The Ac-ERG technique              is unseasoned; this project will polish it via experimentation with             several of its facets, to learn its strengths and weaknesses and                better define its inter-pretability and range of aptness.  Two                  conspicuous limitations of the Ac-ERG technique are:  1)                        restriction to submerged samples (much of the decomposition of                  shoots of intertidal plants occurs while shoots are out of the                  water); 2) in-applicability for marine oomycotes (very common                   protoctistan decomposers of marine leaf litter; they do not                     synthesize ergosterol).  This project will attempt to try to expand             the utility of Ac-ERG technique by modifying it to remove these two             constraints through: 1) presenting the radio-acetate to the sample              in a volatilized state; 2) finding neutral lipids peculiar to                   oomycotes and following radio-acetate flow to them.  The results of             this research should be a more powerful, more durable, and better               understood means of estimating marine eucaryotic organo-osmotrophic             productivity.",
