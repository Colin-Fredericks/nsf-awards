 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial funding for an international symposium              in environmental ethics entitled \"Theory Meets Practice.\"  The                  symposium is sponsored and supported by the University of Georgia,              the Fondazione Lanza, the International Scoeity for Environmental               Ethics, the International Ecological Society, and the Council of                Educators in Landscape Architecture.  The conference has four                   subthemes:  What are the practical implications of new                          environmental ethics theories on environmental problems?  To what               extent should legislation of ecological sustainability restrict                 property rights?  How can nationsl share responsibility for global              environmental problems?  How can military and political threats to              the environment be diminished?  Speakers include philosophers,                  theologians, ecologists, and environmental policy experts from the              United States, other industrialized countries, and developing                   countries.  This is the first international environmental ethics                meeting to be held in the United States; the event and its                      proceedings should stimulate increasing attention to these issues               by U.S. academicians, policymakers, and interested citizens.                                                                                                    This project allows a highly qualified group of researchers from                different disciplinary backgrounds in the United States and abroad              to address theoretical issues in and practical issues of                        environmental ethics.  The principal investigators and conference               participants are well qualified; institutional support is very                  good.  A volume of general interest to the field will result.  The              budget request is modest.  Support is recommended.",
