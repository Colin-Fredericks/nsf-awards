 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project combines the mathematics of classical geometric               function theory with newly discovered applications of circle                    packing.  The source of this connection lies in a conjecture of                 W. Thurston in 1985 that one should be able to obtain good                      approximations to the Riemann map of a simply connection planar                 domain through a circle packing of the domain following by a                    mapping of the circles by a prescribed algorithm.  This turned                  out to be the case and is now known as the Finite Riemann Mapping               Theorem.  The proof spawned a new line of investigation within                  the field of complex analysis: what type of theorems can be                     proved by circle packing and, more importantly, what                            new discoveries are opened up by means of this new technique?                   Work now continues as the breadth of possibilities broadens.                    Topics to be investigated include hexagonal packing and the                     asymptotics and the ratios of maximum and minimum radii, the                    classical problem of canonical conformal maps of multiply                       connected regions - whether arbitrary domains are conformally                   equivalent to domains with boundary components of circles or                    line.  Work will also be done in extending results on osculating                Mobius transformations of a circle packing which are known to                   converge and give the first and second derivatives of the Riemann               map.  The question of whether higher order derivatives can also                 be approximated will be examined.                                                    Complex function theory encompasses the study of                           differentiable functions of a complex variable and related                      classes of functions such as harmonic functions and                             quasiconformal mappings.  The subject is highly geometric; many                 of the problems concern the properties of various sets under                    transform by functions from one of the above classes.                           Applications to potential theory and fluid dynamics is now                      standard in engineering circles.",
