 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under support from DMS 8713718, a problem of paramount                     interest was to generalize elliptic cohomology so as to encompass               curves of higher genus.  Y. Shimizu and the investigator found a                solution to this problem (over the rational numbers), based on                  the idea that affine connections on elliptic curves (which do not               generalize to higher genus) should be interpreted as special                    cases of the projective connections (which exist for all Riemann                surfaces).  This allowed them to associate in a natural way to                  any chiral conformal field theory  (in the sense of Segal),                     the topological genus defined by the projective connection (or                  stress-energy tensor) of the field theory.  They were able                      to identify this genus in the case of the charge-one fermion and                to show that it reduced (in the case of the elliptic curve) to                  the elliptic genus.  A corollary of this construction is that the               complex cobordism ring supports a canonical quadratic                           differential, closely related in some way to a quadratic                        differential supported by the fundamental bosonic                               representation of the Virasoro algebra.  The relation between                   these two quadratic differentials seems to be of fundamental                    importance and will be a major emphasis of the current project.                 In recent years mathematical constructions inspired by theories                 used to make sense of subatomic particles have found repeated                   application to purely geometric problems.  To their mutual profit               physicists and mathematicians are interacting more than ever in                 exploring these connections, and the investigator is a major                    player in this game.",
