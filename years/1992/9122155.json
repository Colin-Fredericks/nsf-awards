 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most quantitative research on the determinants of                          technological innovation has focused on factors endogenous to the               industry, firm, plant, or production process.  The largely case                 study-based research on industrial districts has emphasized the                 positive impacts on firm performance of embeddedness into local                 concentrations of similar productive activity.  This research has               not explicitly examined locational factors affecting firm                       performance.  This study will attempt to formally model the ways                in which the spatial and institutional context conditions the                   impacts of technical, economic, and organizational variables on                 the performance of manufacturing establishments in the                          metalworking sector of the economy.  It will investigate the                    extent to which variations among U.S. counties in sameness,                     diversity, access, and business leadership help to explain inter-               plant variation in efficiency, technological innovation, and                    plant survival.  Data will come from two panel surveys of over                  1000 establishments, the U.S. Census of Manufactures, and                       corporate data base files.  Several hypotheses will be tested                   with multivariate statistical techniques.                                            This study promises to yield significant new information,                  and it will test a new theory on the interplay between inter-                   organizational structures and spatial context.  It will implement               new empirical measures of the extent to which agglomeration                     influences the performance of manufacturing firms in the U.S.",
