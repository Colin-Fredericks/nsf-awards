 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent investigation point to the latest Proterozoic (0.5-0.9              Ga) as being a time of vast evolutionary change.  Well-preserved                sedimentary successions in Namibia, Spitsbergen, South Africa and               China have been studied in detail as they contain important                     economic deposits and remnants of the first metazoan faunas.  In                addition, strong carbon- and strontium-isotopic variations are                  found in these sequences and may be useful for the correlation of               coeval strata world-wide.  We propose to continue research on the               isotopic variations in C, Sr and Nd in well-characterized and well-             preserved stratigraphic samples from the Nama, Polarisbreen and                 Kango groups as well as the Doushantuo and Dengying formations to               better characterize the rate of isotopic change during the latter               part of the Proterozoic Eon.  Given a better knowledge of the rate              of isotopic changes in latest Proterozoic seawater our goals are                to:                                                                             1) trace the major mass fluxes in the exogenic geochemical cycle                and understand the relationship between the evolution of the                    sedimentary reservoir, the oceans and the atmosphere during the                 Late Proterozoic, 2) determine rates of erosion, organic carbon                 burial and hydrothermal alteration and their relation to global                 tectonics, 3) investigate the relationship of strong isotopic                   variations to known events of glaciations, phosphorite and banded               iron-formation deposition, and 4) strengthen the tie between chemo-             stratigraphic and bio-stratigraphic correlations between these Late             Proterozoic successions.                                                             During the Proterozoic, seawater Nd and Sr budgets appear to               have changed from dominantly hydrothermal inputs (as in the                     Archean) to dominantly continental (river) inputs.  Modeling of the             data obtained from this research will be used to constrain the                  changes in rates of hydrothermal circulation, continental erosion               rates, burial rates of organic carbon and variations in the mean                age of continental erosion products through the late Proterozoic.               Implications for the evolution of O2 and CO2 in the Earth's                     atmosphere will also be considered.  We have demonstrated with our              previous work that high resolution Sr and C isotopic curves may be              obtained for late Proterozoic sedimentary successions and are                   confident that this research will lead to major breakthroughs in                our understanding of Late Proterozoic evolution.",
