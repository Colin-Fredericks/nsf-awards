 "awd_abstract_narration": "The statistical mechanics of ordering in intermetallic alloys will              be studied by performing numerical simulations and renormalization              group calculations based on a model atomistic hamiltonian derived               from the Hohenberg-Kohn density functional theory.  The                         construction of the hamiltonian is based on the effective medium                theory of chemical binding which provides a simple yet accurate                 description of the interatomic interactions mediated by the fermi               sea of electrons in a metal.  The specific systems to be studied                include copper-gold binary alloys and aluminum based transition                 alloys which exhibit quasicrystalline structures.  We will study                both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena.                                  %%%                                                                             The proposed research will conduct theoretical studies of the phase             diagrams, including both equilibrium and kinetic effects, for two               classes of alloys.  The copper-gold system is a prototypical binary             alloy which is well studied experimentally.  The aluminum based                 transition alloys are of more technological importance and are of               additional scientific interest due to the quasicrystalline phases               which can form.  The Principal Investigator has conducted                       preliminary work through a Research Opportunities for Women Career              Advancement Award.",
