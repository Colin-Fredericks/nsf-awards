 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is at the interface between materials science             and chemistry/biochemistry.  The collaborative research effort is               aimed at developing a new type of biomolecular material in which                enzymes and other proteins are encapsulated in inorganic glass                  matrices synthesized by the sol-gel method at room temperature.                 Biochemistry is largely a solution-based discipline, but the                    application of the sol-gel technique enables us to prepare novel                solid-state materials which exhibit the electrical, optical,                    chemical and biological properties of the biomolecule as well as                the stability and integrity of the inorganic oxide matrix.  The                 primary objectives of this project are (1) to develop methods of                synthesis for this new class of solid-state biomolecular materials,             (2) to elucidate the nature of the interactions between the glasses             and the biomolecules and (3) to explore applications of these                   materials as optically-based biosensors.  The research results are              expected to provide a fundamental understanding of the role of                  synthesis conditions in retaining the properties of the biomolecule             dopant in the solid-state environment.  The optical transparency of             the matrix enables us to use spectroscopic methods to characterize              the structure, chemical function and activity of the biomolecule                dopant.  The work on biosensors is designed to exploit the                      specificity of enzymes and other proteins in combination with the               transparent, porous and chemically stable matrix of the inorganic               oxide.                                                                                                                                                          This Materials Synthesis and Processing project is jointly funded               by the NSF Divisions:  The Division of Materials Research; Division             of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences; Division of Chemistry.",
