 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the evolutionary history of a group of                  South american passerine birds,t he subfamily Furnariinae or                    ovenbirds.  During geological history, when South America was                   isolated from the other continents by water barriers, this group                underwent a remarkable adaptive radiation into a variety of                     ecological roles which, in other parts of the world, are filled by              members of many other families.  The comparative anatomy of                     the hindlimb musculature and external morphology, including the                 bill, nostrils, feet, and tail, will be studied by dissection and               observation of museum specimens.  anatomical variations will be                 described and illustrated, and the direction in which characters                evolved will be determined.  Using this information the phylogeny               of pattern of common descent will be generated by computer.  This               will reveal how different groups, evolving separately, have                     developed adaptation for similar ways of life in parallel.  From                the conclusions reached, the evolutionary history of the ovenbirds              will be clarified, the classification will be revised, and the                  insight will be gained into the mechanisms and limitations of the               evolutionary process.",
