 "awd_abstract_narration": "The various directions of this research are bound by a                     common theme, the use of variational methods in addressing                      problems of mathematical analysis.  Areas of concern include                    dynamical systems, nonlinear partial differential equations and                 geometry.  The methods, both analytical and topological, are                    rooted in previous work; in particular on variational problems in               which compactness assumptions are not available.                                     Among the topics to be investigated is symbolic dynamics, in               which the contribution of the periodic orbits provided by the                   Birkhoff-Lewis theorem connects the framework used in dynamical                 systems with that used in variational theory.  A particular goal                is to carry over existing work to the case where the stable and                 unstable manifolds of a hyperbolic fixed point intersect                        transversely.  This situation arises frequently in the study of                 dynamical systems, for example in the restricted three-body                     problem.                                                                             Related work will be carried out on collisions and existence               of periodic orbits of three-body type.  It is planned to                        establish the existence of infinitely many generalized solutions                and to demonstrate that these solutions have good properties,                   i.e. that one can attach to each of them a Morse index which                    describes the difference of topology that they induce in the                    level sets of the variational problem.                                               Variational methods in science date back to the nineteenth                 century when the mathematical framework of much of what we know                 as the physical universe was laid out.  The principles of least                 action and energy minimization still apply to many of the models                used in describing natural phenomena.  The present work continues               investigations into the mathematical consequences and equations                 which arise from variational approaches to the study of complex                 motions.",
