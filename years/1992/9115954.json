 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a U.S.-France Workshop in high                          performance polymers organized jointly by Matthew Tirrell of the                University of Minnesota, Alain Michel of the Laboratory of                      Organic Materials, and Alain Fradel of Pierre and Marie Curie                   University, Paris, France.  New developments in high performance                polymer materials are of technological importance in                            microelectronics, ceramics, medicine and separation processes.                  The workshop will focus on the development of high performance                  properties beyond the current norm.  They will address developing               multicomponent materials of increased strength, chemical or                     thermal resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity, improved                  nonlinear optical properties, and effectiveness as interfacial agents.          Multicomponent refers to existing composites, copolymers, blends,               grafts and semicrystalline materials.  The workshop participants                will exchange information and review the state of the art in this               area.                                                                                                                                                           This workshop will bring together strong French expertise and                   tradition in macromolecular chemistry and American experience                   spanning the range of chemical synthesis to processing.  It is                  expected that future research areas, including joint activities, will           be defined.",
