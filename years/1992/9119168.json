 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed toward the examination, composition and                function of the flagellar transition region of Chlamydomonas                    reinhardtii.  The combined genetic, molecular, and ultrastructural              approach will focus on the presence of the calcium-binding protein              centrin, which is thought to be in the stellate fibers of the                   transition region.  Several centrin mutants have been                           characterized, including one where glu 101 has been converted to                lys in one of the E-F-hands (a calcium binding site on the protein.             Chlamydomonas mutants should also permit the enrichment of                      flagellar transition regions, where the phenotypic expression of                supernumarary transition regions increases the likelihood of                    biochemical purification protocols.  It is unlikely that the                    transition region can be studied in this fashion with any other                 organism.                                                                       %%%                                                                                All eukaryotic cilia and flagella possess a highly specialized               transition region in the section of the axoneme that is immediately             adjacent with the cell body.  The transition region is not well                 understood functionally, though it has been characterized                       ultrastructurally in a number of organisms.  In the unicellular                 alga Chlamydomonas reinhartii, the flagellar transition region can              be studied by a combination of methods that include genetic                     manipulation, biochemical isolation and ultrastructural                         observation.  This project combines these approaches in a novel way             that should contribute important compositional and functional                   information about the flagellar transition region, not only in C.               reinhardtii, but in other flagellated cells, as well.",
