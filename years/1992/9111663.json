 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the completion, extension and further                development of a purely combinatorial and axiomatic description                 of new three-dimensional invariants obtained from the Jones                     polynomial.  These invariants were first described using ideas                  from quantum physics by the mathematical physicist E. Witten and                later established by Reshethikin and Turaev, using the                          combinatorics of representations of quantum groups.  A purely                   combinatorial approach was pioneered by Lickorish in the case of                the classical one-variable Jones polynomial, evaluated at roots                 of unity of the parameter.  This approach was recently extended                 by Blanchet-Habegger-Masbaum-Vogel to half-integer roots.                       They have also given a proof that the combinatorial theory                      satisfies the axioms for a topological quantum field theory                     first enunciated by Atiyah and Segal.  The proof of the axioms                  is purely combinatorial using only the algebra and combinatorics                of the Kauffman (skein) module of three-manifolds.  The                         investigation of the axiomatics/combinatorics of the other                      Jones-Witten invariants may possibly be achieved using more                     general skein modules.  Further, the rich supply of invariants                  should provide a basis for new approaches to old problems, such                 as link and three-manifold classification.  Finally, the                        combinatorial approach will likely lead to effective methods of                 computation.                                                                         Knots are rather elementary geometric objects whose                        really interesting properties are topological.  By this we mean                 that two geometric knots do not differ in an interesting way if                 one of them can be transformed to look just like the other                      without cutting or untying it, just by pushing its string about                 to rearrange the crossings.  Topologists say that they are                      two different geometric realizations of the same topological                    knot. Nevertheless, it is not a trivial matter to recognize when                one complicated geometric knot is topologically different from                  another, rather than just a different geometric realization.                    This problem can be addressed by computing certain numbers                      or polynomials which are called \"topological invariants,\" meaning               that they always have the same value for different geometric                    realizations of the same topological knot.  The problem would                   be reduced to pure algebra if there were one invariant which                    also always has different values for geometric realizations                     of different topological knots, but life is not so simple--no                   single invariant achieves this ideal, nor even all the known                    invariants taken together.  It is therefore valuable to                         investigate new invariants, some of the most useful being those                 inspired in recent years by ideas from quantum physics.  In                     particular, applications of knot theory to the biology of long                  strands of DNA have drawn upon knowledge of these newer                         invariants.",
