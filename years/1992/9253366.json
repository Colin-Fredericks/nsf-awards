 "awd_abstract_narration": "The videodisc-based exhibit, the Powers of Ten in Time, will                    allow museum visitors to explore the unseen world of natural                    change - events that occur too quickly or too slowly to be                      perceived.                                                                                                                                                      Through the use of a touch screen and interactive software,                     users will be able to, in effect, speed up or slow down timeto                  witness changes that lie outside of the limits of human time                    perception.  Visitors will see scenes such as a forest                          recovering after a fire, a wall of earth crumbling from erosion,                tides coming in and out, the intricate motions of complex                       machinery and molecules colliding and reacting to produce fire.                 The videodiscs will contain more than 100 short video segments                  depicting a wide range of phenomena.  We will use time-lapse                    footage, slow-motion clips and animations to show changes                       occurring over time periods form 300,000,000 to femtoseconds.                                                                                                   Not only will museum visitors be able to watch these video                      segments at their own pace and in order they choose, they will                  also be able to learn more about such phenomena through on-                     screen textual and graphical explanations.  The goal of the                     project is to engage museum visitors with captivating                           photographic segments, explain the phenomena shown with                         supplemental text and graphics, and stimulate them to look at                   the world in a new way - not  just with their eyes, but with                    their minds and imaginations.",
