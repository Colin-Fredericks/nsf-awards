 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goal of this project is to study the membrane                         mechanisms involved in signalling thermal stimuli by                            nerve cells in the trigeminal ganglion which receives                           information from the face.  A novel, miniature thermal                          stimulator is being developed which will apply highly                           localized and well-controlled heat stimuli to these                             trigeminal sensory neurons which are maintained in a                            cell-culture environment.  This new instrument is based                         upon a commercially available miniature thermometer which                       utilizes a temperature-dependent change in the rate of                          decay of fluorescence emitted by a phosphor coating at                          the tip of a fiberoptic probe.  The tip of the                                  temperature probe functions as a black-body radiator by                         covering it with a layer of gold.  A new optical assembly                       couples the optical fiber to both a xenon flash light and                       an infrared laser diode.  Injection of both infrared and                        blue radiation into the optic fiber will make it possible                       to simultaneously heat the front of the probe and measure                       its surface temperature.  By utilizing the temperature                          signal in a feedback loop and pulse-modulating the output                       of the infrared laser diode, it is possible to accurately                       control the highly localized heat stimuli.  This new                            instrument should have many important applications in                           biological research.",
