 "awd_abstract_narration": "Potsdam College will conduct on its campus the \"Summer 1992                     Workshop for High School Mathematics/Computer Science                           Teachers\" as a three-week intensive workshop for                                approximately twenty high school teachers of mathematics and                    computer science living within a 200-mile radius of Potsdam,                    NY.  The workshop is to be team-taught by three members of                      the computer and information sciences department, including                     its chair and two members with secondary school teaching                        experience.                                                                                                                                                     Individual and group efforts to solve problems posed by the                     staff team will emphasize the interplay of computational and                    analytical techniques in solving a variety of problems                          arising in the high school curriculum.  Participants will                       enhance their computer programming and problem solving skills                   during classroom discussions and presentations of problems                      and pedagogy as well as in computer laboratory experiences                      taking place in a PC lab dedicated solely to the workshop.                      The teachers will finish the workshop with a collection of                      specific problems they have solved, knowing the exact levels                    of skill, techniques, and background needed to solve each as                    well as placement in the high school curriculum.                                                                                                                Follow-up includes each participant being invited to share                      experiences of implementation in a one-day workshop each                        semester of that same academic year in conjunction with an                      already established series the Computer Science Department at                   Potsdam holds for local area high school teachers.                                                                                                              This project will stimulate and guide teachers of high school                   mathematics and computer science in shifting their teaching                     practices toward problem-solving approaches and constructive                    methods(including use of computer technology) sensitive to                      the development of their individual students.                                                                                                                   Potsdam College of SUNY cost sharing accounts for 5.8% of the                   NSF budget contribution.",
