 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific \"types\" of species names are the actual plant               or animal specimens, housed typically in natural history                        museums, that were used by biologists when describing and naming                a new species.  Unfortunately, natural historians of the 18th and               19th centuries rarely designated a single specimen as type, and                 consequently there can be confusion over the correct application                of a scientific species name.  The Linnean Plant Name                           Typification project is designed to provide a thorough and                      scholarly assessment of the types for each of the approximately                 9800 species names published by the great Swedish naturalist Carl               Linneaus in the 18th century.  Many of these names pertain to                   economically or commercially important plants including numerous                crops, spices, medicinals, and horticultural items.  Hence, the                 use of correct and stable names is paramount both for scientific                and practical reasons.                                                               Drs. Porter Lowry and Fred Barrie of the Missouri Botanical                Garden, working with Dr. Charles Jarvis of the British Natural                  History Museum, are continuing their careful studies of type                    specimens housed in herbaria in Europe and elsewhere, pertinent                 to the application of Linnaeus's names.  These names have                       priority as the first correct scientific names of plants, under                 conventions established at international botanical congresses,                  and ratified every five to six years at regular meetings of these               organizations.  A computerized database of names and specimens                  and associated information is being developed in conjunction with               this work, and will be available through the Missouri Botanical                 Garden to all researchers on plants.",
