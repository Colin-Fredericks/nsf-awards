 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in               the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                 subfields of bioanalysis and neurochemistry.  During the tenure of              this five-year award, Professor Sweedler and his students will                  develop the analytical instrumentation and methodology capable of               identifying and quantifying neuronal releasates from a single                   nerve terminal and the contents of individual varicosities, and                 then use those techniques to better understand the mechanisms of                cellular communication.  Specific thrusts include the development               of capillary zone electrophoresis/laser induced fluorescence                    instrumentation and methodology to assay and quantitate the                     contents of individual varicosities and vesicles; demonstration of              the capabilities of that instrumentation using cultured neurons;                study of the distribution of neuropeptides within individual                    neurons of the giant marine mollusk Aplysia; quantitative                       measurement of the peptide content of individual varicosities                   along a nerve process; measurement of the release of neuropeptides              from a single nerve terminal; and determination of whether                      facilitation in Aplysia neurons is due to enhancement of                        neurotransmitter release.                                                       %%%                                                                             The successful attainment of the goals of this project will afford              protocols for the reliable quantitation of analytes in the                      zeptomole range, thereby extending the sensitivity of conventional              cell sampling techniques by over a thousand fold.  This research                will also serve to further bridge the scientific domains of                     analytical chemistry and cellular neurobiology, lead to a                       description of the subcellular dynamics of neuronal signalling,                 and contribute to our basic understanding of the nervous system.",
