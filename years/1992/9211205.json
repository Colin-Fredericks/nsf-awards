The contributions are                   organized thematically, so that the book may be used more                       efficiently as a standard reference on the genesis of Atlantic                  creoles than as simple conference proceedings.  Despite its                     title, Africanisms fosters a dialogue between the African                       Substrate Hypothesis, the Language Bioprogram Hypothesis (now                   improved into the Lexical Learning Hypothesis), and the                         Superstrate Hypothesis.  The book is a turning point for the                    Substrate Hypothesis, highlighting the enormous complexity of the               subject matter of creole genesis, and suggesting for future                     research analyses that are much more eclectic and sophisticated                 than those in the literature.  The book will contribute to a                    wider dissemination of new research avenues and conceptual                      adjustments.",
