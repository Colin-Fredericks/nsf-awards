 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals affect plant community structure and dynamics directly                  (consumption) and indirectly (physical disturbance).  It is clear               that in addition, the spatial pattern of impacts also                           significantly influences the structure of plant communities.                    This collaborative research project will test a series of                       hypotheses concerning the spatial patterns of herbivore influence               using a system of animal-generated disturbances (plains pocket                  gophers in herbaceous plant communities) that occur in spatially                predictable patterns (uniformly spaced burrows and aggregated                   mounds on the surface).  The impact of the spatial pattern of                   disturbance on resource distribution and plant community structure              will be investigated.  Furthermore, these patterns will be analyzed             at several scales (from microscale neighborhood effects to                      field-wide patterns).  Comparisons also will be made between two                sites that differ significantly in soil characteristics, allowing               analysis of the amplitude of herbivore-generated effects in                     relation to soil fertility.  This work will contribute                          significantly to understanding the role of animals in plant                     community structure by determining the patterns of animal                       activities and the mechanisms by which they are translated into                 pattern in the environment, in plant growth and recruitment, and                in vegetation across spatial scales ranging from several cm2  to                hundreds of m2.",
