 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic objective of this research is the development of a modal              analysis methodology for nonlinear structures, which utilizes a                 newly introduced formulation of nonlinear normal modes of                       vibration. The importance of the subject stems from the fact that               a modal analysis of a nonlinear structure that relies on the modes              of the associated linearized system may require an unpractical                  number of such terms in order to yield satisfactory modal                       convergence. This is because, even through for the linearized                   structure the linear models yield uncoupled modal dynamics and                  hence optimal modal convergence, in the  nonlinear case these                   linear modes become  coupled by the nonlinear terms, resulting in               deterioration of the modal convergence. The proposed nonlinear                  modal analysis is based upon a definition and formulation                       of nonlinear normal modes of motion in terms of invariant                       manifolds. This approach is general and is not restricted to linear             systems, nor to conservative systems, nor to finite-dimensional                 systems. In addition, the  formulation is constructive for weakly               nonlinear systems and provides the physical nature of the nonlinear             modes, the associated modal  dynamics, and the way in which the                 nonlinear modal coordinates are related to the physical                         coordinates. The proposed methodology will allow for many important             research problems to be addressed, including the outstanding                    questions of how to choose optimal mode shapes for modal analysis               of nonlinear dynamical systems. In order to attach these problems,              and integrated strategy is chosen which involves analytical,                    computational, and experimental components.***",
