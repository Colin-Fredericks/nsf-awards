 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parque Nacional \"Noel Kempff Mercado\" is one of only three                 functioning biological reserves in the Andean country of Bolivia.               Several preliminary inventories of its flora and fauna have been                conducted by U.S.-based scientists and have consisted of short term             visits during the dry season. This new project is a joint effort by             two Bolivian research institutions and the Missouri Botanical                   Garden. Project personnel will conduct an extensive plant inventory             over a three year period, during wet and dry seasons, and the                   results will be incorporated into a computerized Geographical                   Information System that will be used to formulate management plans              for the park and surrounding areas. Bolivia's largest forest                    reserves are adjacent to the park, and rational stewardship of                  these resources including surrounding watersheds requires                       information about the plants, their habitat preferences and                     flowering and fruiting schedules, and geographical distributions.               A significant component of the research involves training and                   research with host country botanists and students.",
