 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project for instrument development will provide components                for a multichamber surface science system that will be attached to              an ultra-high vacuum high resolution electron microscope at                     Northwestern University for the fundamental study of material                   surfaces.  Unique studies of film growth, interactions of gases                 with surfaces,  fundamental surface science, and buried interface               problems with a true marriage of traditional surface science and                high resolution electron microscopy will be capable with this                   instrument.  The basic idea is to change from a single, limited                 transfer chamber to a set of interconnected chambers, each                      specializing in a different set of techniques.  The resulting                   system will consist of four chambers with a small airlock specimen              entry system and a central transfer vessel.  This project has                   several goals:  to store samples under UHV,  to have separate                   chambers where deposition or gas treatments can be performed, to                have small probe imaging equipment available, to have good chemical             analysis.   The project combines electron microscopy with surface               science and thin films technology.   Research projects will focus               on fundamental thin film research, surfaces and catalysis, and                  grain boundary studies, involving several groups at Northwestern,               collaborations with National Laboratories, and industry. //",
