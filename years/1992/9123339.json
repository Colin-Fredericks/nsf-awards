The research will explore the range of ligand                       intermediates that may be formed in thin film depositions of                    binary early transition metal oxides, sulfides and nitrides.                    Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) routes to thin films will be                    developed using volatile metal halides and organic oxygen,                      nitrogen and sulphur compounds. The coordination chemistry of                   titanium, zirconium and hafnium tetrachlorides with alcohols,                   amines and thiols will be investigated to gain a deeper                         understanding of the types of ligand ensembles that may be                      produced in film-forming processes.  Complexes will be prepared                 in both solution phase and gas phase reactions in order to                      understand the relationship between these potentially divergent                 processes.  All stable complexes will be evaluated as CVD                       precursors. A mechanistic sequence for each material that leads                 from starting materials to the thin film will be developed.                     %%%                                                                             Thin ceramic films made by CVD processes are of growing                         technological importance.  The range of ligand intermediates                    that can be supported at a metal will illustrate broad                          principles of CVD that can be applied to other film depositions                 and greatly enhance chemical predictability.",
