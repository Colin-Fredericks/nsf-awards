 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Paul is examining the relationship among science,                     production and consumption.  His study examines such issues as the              use of technology to improve product quality, the role of                       government in protecting the health of its citizens, the sometimes              competing role of government in promoting economic development, and             the process of the spread of technology through capitalistic                    enterprise and government initiative.                                                                                                                           Professor Paul is examining these issues in the context of the                  application of science in the development of the wine industry both             in France and in California.   The study begins with the efforts of             scientists to cope with the disastrous infestation of the plant                 louse which wiped out all of the old French vines.  Scientists                  \"invented\" a post-phylloxera vine to cope with this and other                   infestations (oidium, blackrot, mildew, etc.).  No less a scientist             than Louis Pasteur played a major role in the development of the                new science of oenology, drawing on fundamental research in botany,             chemistry, biology and medical science.  Importantly, Professor                 Paul will show how scientists were directed in their research by                consumers and their developing tastes for wine.  Scientists                     harnessed their expertise to develop a wine based on a taste model              whose formation is a complex historical and aesthetical process.                The producer, scientist and consumer had to reach consensus on a                fundamental long-term if tacit agreement on the nature of this                  taste model.                                                                                                                                                    This history of oenology promises to make significant contributions             to our understanding of how science is applied to meet not only the             \"needs\" but the \"taste\" of its users.  The study should be of                   interest to historians of science, technology and medicine as well              as cultural and social historians and those interested in the                   history of wine.",
