This Committee will advise Federal                     agencies through the interagency Committee on Earth and                         Environmental Sciences (CEES) Working Group on Global Change on                 scientific planning for the U.S. Global Change Research Program.                The CGCR will: (1) formulate scientific recommendations for                     coordinating the U.S. Global Change Research Program with                       internationally planned activities; (2) provide liaison between                 international and U.S. planning efforts by serving as the U.S.                  national committee for the international programs on global change;             and (3) hold frequent meetings with representative of the CEES                  Working Group on Global Change to assure coordination of NRC                    activities and to communicate science needs of the U.S. Global                  Change Research Program.  The CGCR will coordinate its activities               with those of other NAS/NRC boards and committees working in                    related areas, and will develop a comprehensive NAS/NRC proposal,               to be submitted to the Federal agencies for FY 1992 funding, that               will encompass all NAS/NRC activities undertaken primarily for                  issues related to global change.",
