 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Carboniferous is the Age of Echinoderms, especially                    stemmed echinoderms.  Faunas are commonly abundant and diverse, but             many genera are high endemic.  Crinoid endemism can make                        biogeographic analysis difficult, but could play a positive role                in assessing the proximity of continental blocks during the                     Carboniferous.  In this study, we will focus on echinoderms from                the latest Devonian and Carboniferous of China that could provide               constraints to paleogeographic reconstructions of the closure of                Paleo-Tethys.  Sparse collections of crinoids from the latest                   Devonian of northwestern China indicate the presence of a fauna                 that may be intermediate in nature between older (Devonian)                     European echinoderm communities and younger (Early Carboniferous)               North American echinoderm communities.  Camerate crinoids decreased             in diversity and abundance, becoming virtually \"extinct\" in North               America and Europe.  However, some Carboniferous camerates survived             elsewhere in the world and eventually made a dramatic, although                 short-lived, comeback during the Permian in the Tethyan realm                   (e.g., Australia, Timor, and the USSR).  Collections of crinoids                from the mid-Carboniferous of southeastern China indicate the                   presence of a fauna that may have set the stage for this Tethyan                re-radiation of camerate-rich assemblages.  We will test the                    hypothesis that certain elements of the Carboniferous echinoderm                community radiated through Asia during the latest Devonian and                  earliest Carboniferous, expanded globally in the Carboniferous,                 then contracted back to the Tethyan realm during the latest                     Carboniferous.",
