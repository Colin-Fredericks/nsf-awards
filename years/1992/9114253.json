 "awd_abstract_narration": "A comprehensive investigation of the preparation of advanced                    materials by the Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis                    (SHS) Process will be conducted. (The SHS process is a powder-                  based process, where at least one of the reactant materials is                  a finely-divided powder.  Two primary classes of SHS reactions                  are those involving two solids (S/S) and those involving a                      solid and a gas (G/S); the reactions in both cases are                          characteristically exothermic.  When the reactant mixture is                    \"ignited\" at one end, a self-sustaining or self-propagating                     \"combustion wave\" proceeds through the packed bed of material,                  leaving a condensed product or product mixture in its wake.)                    Enhanced and precise control of the product microstructure is                   a major goal of this program.  The study is expected to                         identify and quantify key micromechanistic processes which                      determine the type, size, and distribution of the product                       phases (as well as the porosity characteristics) in the                         synthesized material.  Activity in this program will focus on                   the intrinsic reaction kinetics in samples with a well-defined                  micro-structure.  The samples will consist of a metallic or                     bimetallic foil embedded in an SHS powder mixture.  The powder                  will be ignited in the usual fashion so that both the powder                    and the foil participate in the SHS reaction.  The diffusion,                   melting, and/or reaction at the foil interface will thus be                     driven on the same temperature and time scales as a                             conventional SHS reaction.  Thus, a \"microstructure\" which can                  be readily characterized will be created, and an idealized                      large, flat interface will be subjected to the same                             temperature history as material in a totally powder-based SHS                   reaction.  Diffusion coefficients, reaction kinetic                             parameters, and resulting phase distributions will all be                       obtained.  Both a solid-solid and a gas-solid system will be                    studied.  A relatively simple model of this idealized                           configuration will be developed to aid in the extraction of                     the fundamental kinetic parameters.  This study is expected to                  establish a strong processing-microstructure-material                           properties relationship; the enhanced fundamental                               understanding of the interrelationships involved in SHS                         processing will lead to development of standardized approaches                  for producing materials with a controlled/tailored                              microarchitecture. Emphasis in this particular program will be                  placed on experimental and theoretical studies of the                           intrinsic kinetics involved; additional tasks regarding other                   aspects of SHS processing, particularly as applied to                           production of \"functionally gradient\" materials will be                         carried out on a parallel program being funded concurrently by                  the Army Research Office.                                                                                                                                       Fundamental studies of the detailed mechanisms involved in SHS                  processing are needed for attainment of the full potential of                   this novel method for production of advanced materials with                     unique properties; without such understanding of these                          mechanisms, production of products with properties optimized                    for various end uses will remain very difficult and time                        consuming, with a long learning process having to be repeated                   for each new application.  Fine-tuning the SHS process to                       produce materials with well-defined (and controlled)                            composition gradients and/or pore structures will make major                    contributions to such widely varied applications as catalyst                    support materials, heat-engine components, porous preforms for                  composite materials fabrication, disk brakes, high-temperature                  filter media, high-surface area adsorption materials,                           piezoelectric devices, and shape-selective separation media.",
