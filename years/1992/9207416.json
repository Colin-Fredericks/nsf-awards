 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Computer Science at the University of                    Georgia proposes to trade-in its intel iPSC/2 D4 hypercube for an               intel iPSC/860 Model 8 supercomputer system (see specifications                 in part V).  This equipment will be dedicated to the support of                 research in mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used                  for several research projects, including in particular:                         (i)  Dr. T. Taha (Computer Science Department) for developing                   parallel algorithms for Inverse Scattering Transform IST                        numerical schemes for solving both one dimensional and                          multidimensional nonlinear partial differential equations.  These               equations arise in many areas of application including nonlinear                optics, signal propagation, plasma physics, etc.                                (ii)  Dr. S. Cater and Dr. R. Robinson (both from the Computer                  Science Department) for developing a prototype computing                        environment on an Intel iPSC/860 supercomputer based on the GNU                 C++ compiler and libraries.  The objective is a system which is                 productive for the user and effective in the exploitation of                    parallel computing resources.                                                   (iii)  Dr. D. Gordon (Computer Science Department) for developing               a parallel algorithm for solving large sparse matrices using                    conjugate gradient algorithm.                                                   (iv)  Dr. A. Granville (Mathematics Department), for better                     understanding of the distribution function of the number of                     integers, in intervals of length z, that are free of prime                      factors < y.  Sieving different intervals in parallel will speed                up the computations considerably.                                               (v)  Dr. J. W. Smith (Computer Science Department), for                         developing a general parallel method for the reduction of boolean               (bit) matrices.",
