 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fruits have evolved as a means for plants to disperse                    their seeds.  The progeny of a zoochorous plant that is                         unsuccessful in attracting animal dispersers will likely have                   lower survival than a plant of the same species that does attract               dispersing agents.  Tightly coevolved frugivore-plant systems are               relatively rare, but a bird-plant interaction in Papua New Guinea               offers special opportunities for such a study.                                         The dwarf cassowary (Casuarius bennettii) is frugivorous                 and may be the sole disperser of many large-seeded plant species                in New Guinea.  One hundred twenty 50 x 10 m transects are to be                monitored monthly for the purpose of quantifying crop parameters,               fruit characteristics, and phenological patterns.  Scats are to                 be analyzed to compare cassowary diet with fruit availability on                the transects.  An effort will be made to determine the most                    important factors determining cassowary fruit choice.  Using                    manipulations (such as exclosures), fruit traps, and                            observations, it will be possible to ascertain whether these                    large birds are the sole consumers or sole dispersers of their                  primary food plants.  Radio-tracking is to be utilized in order                 to learn about ranging patterns, habitat use, and specific                      foraging movements.  Finally, this information is to be used in                 conjunction with floral comparisons to estimate the importance of               cassowaries to the evolution and maintenance of New Guinea's                    flora.",
