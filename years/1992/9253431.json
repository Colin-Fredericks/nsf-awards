 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on the experiences of emerging women scientists.          It charts recent developments in Duke University's efforts to address           the underrepresentation of women in science and it proposes a model             project to open conversations about the mentor-student relationship.            The design of the model project is based on a series of discussions             among women scientists (faculty and graduate students) and between              these scientists and this project's investigators.  Advanced graduate           students in science report to us that they confront mentoring practices         and interpersonal behaviors which discourage their advancement.  They           argue that these practices and behaviors are seldom described or                discussed openly among colleagues and so continue to influence women            students' sense of their professional abilities and opportunities, even         in the most well meaning of departments.  Our goal is to initiate               conversations within the science community about issues related to the          education of women as scientists, in order to identify and define the           daily obstacles encountered by graduate women in science, sensitize             faculty advisers/mentors to these obstacles, discuss faculty advisers'          and mentors' concerns about their interactions with graduate women,             introduce emerging women scientists to the perspectives that inform             diverse mentoring approaches and styles, and develop an approach to             evaluating the educational environment for women.",
