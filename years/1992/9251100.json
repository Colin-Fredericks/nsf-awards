 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance the practical experience of the                       senior undergraduates by providing them with the ability to                     perform digital signal processing upon extended segments of                     audio data in the laborator                                                     y.  Audio data has been chosen because it will permit cost-                     effective, real time signal processing.  The availability of                    the equipment provided will greatly improve the quality, and                    quantity, of the experiments that the students can perform.                                                                                                     The need to provide an integrated laboratory setup to gather,                   store, manipulate, and reproduce extended segments of audio                     data has led to the need to purchase a computer system that has                 all the pieces from the microphone through the computer to the                  speaker.  The system selected is based upon a NeXT computer,                    together with some ancillary audio hardware.                                                                                                                    The system will be used to gather audio data from an                            experimental setup.  The data can either be processed in real                   time, or stored in the computer and processed off-line.                         (Processing can be done though both software and the built-in                   Digital Signal Processing board.) The data can be played back                   to give the students direct feedback as to what effects the                     processing had on the audio data.",
