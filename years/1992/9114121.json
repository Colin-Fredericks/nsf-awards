The former will be held from August 16th to 22nd, and the latter                will be held from August 9th to 14th of 1992.  The conference will              examine all aspect of bulk and thin film crystal growth, with                   particular emphasis placed on:  (1) melt and solution growth of                 bulk crystals; (2) thin films and epitaxial  growth by MOCVD and                MBE; (3) crystal compounds including electro-optic materials and                superconductors; (4) the theory of crystal growth; (5) crystal                  growth in microgravity envirenment; (6) novel growth techniques;                and (7) advanced materials, such as fullerenes, light emitting                  silicon structures, and others.                                                 %%%%                                                                            Both the Summer School and the International Conference are the                 major events organized by and for the crystal growth scientific and             technology community of the world.  As such, they are truly                     international, as they are organized and planned by the                         international planning board.  In 1992, it is the U.S. who will act             as the host country.  Both the Summer School and the International              Conference have plans to publich their proceedings.  Proceedings of             this series have been valuable literature in the field of crystal               growth.",
