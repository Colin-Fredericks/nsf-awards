 "awd_abstract_narration": "The topic of interacting binary star systems has become a nexus                 of stellar astrophysics, searching as a bridge between traditional              studies of the evolution of single stars and the newer areas that               include the evolution of accretion disks around companions to                   expanding stars as well as of episodic \"mass losers,\" such as                   B-emission and cataclysmic variable stars. In this two-year                     proposal, the Principal Investigator and his collaborator, Dr. P.               Etzel of San Diego State University, will continue a program of                 simultaneous monitoring of interacting binaries that include an                 evolving hot star (\"Algol systems\"). They will carry out                        observations at the 1-meter telescope of Mt. Laguna Observatory                 outside of San Diego. They will use this facility in a dual mode,               monitoring light and spectral variations nearly simultaneously as               these stars orbit around one another every few days.  They will                 compare these data obtained throughout the orbital period for each              star with models of accretion disks the PI has computed in which                \"non-LTE\" effects are included.",
