 "awd_abstract_narration": "In cognitive psychology, theoretical models of the mental processes             underlying cognitive abilities are proposed, tested and revised on              the basis of patterns of performance over a range of cognitive                  tasks in single-case and group studies involving subjects with                  varying degrees of brain damage.  A theory of cognition is a                    modular functional architecture that provides a computationally                 explicit, information-processing account of how the mental                      representations required to perform these cognitive tasks are                   produced.                                                                                                                                                       Professor Bub is continuing his research applying Dr. Clark                     Glymour's `bootstrapping' account of relevant evidence to a current             methodological controversy in cognitive neuropsychology, concerning             the relation between theory and evidence from single-case and group             studies on brain-damaged and normal subjects.  Professor Bub has                reformulated the original project as an aspect of the general                   problem of how to reliably infer causal relations (representing a               model of cognition) from probability relations (representing                    performance data from normal and brain-damaged subjects).  This new             investigation concerns the status of some of the assumptions that               guarantee the existence of a reliable methodology for cognitive                 neuropsychology, as well as the single-case versus group studies                problem that motivated the original inquiry.",
