 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advent of high speed circuits and mixed analog-digital                 designs, it is important to make sure designs are insensitive to                manufacturing process variations.  Designs must protect against two             types of faults: catastrophic-short and open circuits, and                      parametric where circuits fail due to parameters deviating too far              from their nominal values.  This research is on statistical                     simulation of analog and mixed signal systems.  Three research                  problems are being pursued.  First, a SPICE-based macromodeling                 approach to reducing the simulation time of analog components is                being used.  An algorithm for finding the best parameters, given                the performance needs is being sought.  Second, both circuit level              and macromodel level statistical process models for analog                      components are being explored.  Algorithms for worst case analysis              and for computing parametric yield, which are attuned to the                    complex parameter models of the analog circuit manufacturing                    process are being developed.  Third, a new catastrophic fault model             is the basis of algorithms for efficiently computing catastrophic               fault coverage of test sets.  From this information catastrophic                yield of analog components can be computed.",
