Thus, one can better understand both                      differences among people in social behavior and the development                 of social competence in children by attending to differences in                 individuals' emotional responding and regulation of emotion.                    Currently there is some research both on aspects of emotional                   responding (such as the tendency to experience negative emotions                and the intensity of people's emotional responses) and on self-                 regulatory and coping behaviors.  However, few researchers have                 studied the combined effects on social outcomes of differences                  among people in both emotional reactivity and the ways in which                 people regulate their emotion and emotion-based behavior (e.g.,                 sympathy, anger).  The purpose of the present study is to examine               the relation of individual differences in tendencies to react                   emotionally, emotion-regulation, and styles of coping to                        vicarious emotional responding (e.g. sympathy and empathy),                     social behavior (e.g., behavior when angered), popularity with                  peers, and social competence at school and at home.  In this                    research, the PI's will take a multimethod approach, using self-                report and behavioral measures, facial reactions and                            physiological measures as markers of emotion, and naturalistic                  observational techniques as well as laboratory studies.                         Participants in the studies are preschool and school-aged                       children and adults.  The goals of this research are to better                  understand how people cope with emotions (especially vicariously                induced emotions such as sympathy and personal distress and                     anger), the factor related to constructive coping with emotions,                and the relation of how one deals with emotions to socially                     competent and positive behavior.  This research will enhance our                understanding of the development of socially competent modes of                 behavior and the regulation of negative emotion, and the results                could be used to foster positive social development in children.",
