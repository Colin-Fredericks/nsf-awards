 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new laboratory provides juniors and seniors in Electrical                     Engineering facilities for project design: modeling,                            prototyping, and testing in an environment similar to that of                   an industrial research laboratory.  Students have the resources                 to complete significant projects and also become more familiar                  with the environment they will encounter upon starting careers.                 The laboratory includes:  (1) student workbenches to provide                    immediate access to continuously needed equipment (a networked                  PC, power supply, multimeter, oscilloscope, and circuit board                   assembly tools); (2) mini-laboratories containing equipment                     (printer, logic analyzer, counter, function generator, pulse                    generator, and logic troubleshooting kit) often but not                         continually needed by each student; and (3) computing resources                 served by a 486 PC networked to laboratory workbenches and the                  university computer system.  The laboratory equipment is                        supplemented by a resource center including a component                         warehouse, a design library, and an equipment pool.",
