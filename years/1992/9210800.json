 "awd_abstract_narration": "Societies and organizations spend considerable resources in search              of the truth or to identify the true state of the world.  For                   example, it must be decided whether a defendant is guilty, an                   economy is in recession or a given parcel of land bears oil.                    Usually, the decision is made in a state of relative ignorance                  because no one knows the truth.  The question then arises:  By what             rule should the society decide?  In particular, is the society more             likely to succeed by delegating the task of discovery to one of its             members or to a jury (committee) which follows majority-rule                    voting?  If the latter, who should be on the jury?                                                                                                              When the number of alternatives is two, Condorcet's jury theorem                (CJT) states that under certain conditions a majority of jurors                 would do better than any one individual.  Unfortunately, these                  conditions are difficult to satisfy:  CJT assumes that jurors (i)               share a common goal, and (ii) vote independently.  In reality,                  assumption (i) may not be met, and assumption (ii) is seldom met.                                                                                               This research investigation seeks to advance Condorcet's jury                   theorem in various directions.  It synthesizes the preceding work               on CJT by permitting simultaneously both conflict of interest and               correlated votes.  It studies choice situations where the                       alternatives are not fixed but arise from interactions among the                voters.  In particular, the research seeks to specify conditions                under which a relatively uninformed electorate attains the outcome              it would choose with full information.",
