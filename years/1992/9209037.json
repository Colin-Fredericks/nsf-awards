 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Michael Blakey and                assistants will curate the W. Montague Cobb Human Skeletal                      Collection. These materials were collected by Dr. Cobb in the                   course of his many years of medical school work and are currently               stored at Howard University in conditions which render the                      majority virtually inaccessible for research purposes. The                      collection consists of 737 skeletons and 982 records on these and               other cadavers. What makes these collections particularly                       valuable are the associated records because this gives                          researchers a \"known\" base against which to develop analytical                  methods and to the study effects of processes such as aging and                 diet on the skeletal system.                                                                                                                                    Dr. Blakey plans to renovate and expand his present laboratory                  facility for collection storage, research and related laboratory                courses. Specimens will be relocated to the new laboratory                      facility and stored in adequate cabinets. A detailed and complete               inventory of skeletal specimens and elements will then be made.                 The computer index will be expanded and upgraded and the                        availability of the collection be made known through publication.                                                                                               This project is important for several reasons. There are very few               large and well documented skeletal collections in the United                    States - far too few given present research needs. This project                 will add to the list a third which will be available for study.                 It will also serve to halt the progressive deterioration which                  the materials are undergoing.",
