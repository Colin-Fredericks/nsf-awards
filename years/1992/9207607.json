 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for continued support of research aimed at                   the study of the microscopic structure of the proton using a                    new facility (HERA) in Hamburg, Germany.  The investigator and                  her collaborators have built a large particle detector (ZEUS)                   which is recording the head on collisions of electrons and                      protons, both of which have been accelerated in HERA to very                    high energies.                                                                       The investigator's major role up to this time has been to                  provide a calibration of the calorimeter.  Her continued                        activities are now to concentrate upon the collection of data,                  and beginning of analysis.  She also plans to complete                          analysis of data from the Mark III spectrometer which was used                  at SLAC to study the decays of the psi particles into a number                  of rare modes.",
