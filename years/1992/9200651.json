Eight undergraduate students                     will spend ten weeks during the summer engaged in basic                         research under the direction of the faculty members in the                      Chemistry Department.  Students will be recruited from                          historically Black campuses in Mississippi.  Each of four                       faculty mentors will work with two undergraduates, addressing                   water quality research from the standpoint of their                             specialities (Analytical, Inorganic, Physical, and                              Biochemistry).  A seminar will bring all faculty and students                   together on a daily basis, building strong student-student and                  student-faculty relationships.  Participants will also work                     with a wide variety of chemistry instrumentation not otherwise                  available to them.  Related research skills for the chemist                     will be developed, including software applications, statistics,                 and on-line bibliographical retrieval.",
