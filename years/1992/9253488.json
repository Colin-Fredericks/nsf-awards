 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on this grant will be mainly centered in the areas of                  computation of combustion processes, numerical fluid dynamics,                  and turbulence.  A key distinctive feature of the work                          involves model-free simulation of turbulent reactive flows, an                  approach divergent from traditional \"closure\" approaches to                     turbulence analysis.  The major thrust of the research is                       concerned with development of a basic understanding of                          turbulent combustion phenomena, with a study of the pertinent                   issues as regards eventual application to practical industrial                  applications.  The overall planned activities can be divided                    into four major areas: (1) study of fundamental issues as                       regards the physics of turbulence and turbulent combustion;                     (2) development of advanced computational tools for industrial                  use; (3) study of active and passive control of random and                      harmonic forcings for enhancement or suppression of mixing in                   a research combustor; and, (4) collaborative efforts in                         modeling of transport of gametes, spores, and planktonic of                     larvae of benthic species in turbulent flows.                                                                                                                   Among other outputs, this research should provide further                       insight into shortcomings associated with existing turbulence                   models and identify better approaches to improved (relative to                  current turbulent closure approaches) techniques for                            utilization in practical turbulent combustion modeling,                         providing guidance as to what types of approaches are most                      suitable for various classes of turbulent flow problems.  In                    addition, the third study listed above has a long-term goal of                  establishment of input-output control devices/algorithms for                    definition and control of disturbances in practical combustion                  devices, while the fourth study is quite important as regards                   understanding of the dynamics of settlement and external                        fertilization in violent water motion and in modeling the                       ecology of wave-swept rocky shores.",
