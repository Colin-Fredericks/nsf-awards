 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific findings are treated as more certain and less                   controversial as they migrate downstream, that is, as they are                  interpreted and applied by actors increasingly removed from the                 author's specialty area.  Downstream actors can include the press               or the courts, who can present or apply originally tentative                    findings as though they were engraved in stone.  This process,                  however, can be retraced.  Broadly concerned with toxic health                  risks and more specifically focusing on two case studies--the                   controversies linking spermicides and birth defects and aspirin                 and Reye's Syndrome--this doctoral dissertation project, will                   move \"upstream,\" reconstructing authors' publication decisions.                 Open-ended interviews with both case-study (7-10 principals for                 each case) and main sample subjects (a snowball sample of 40                    epidemiologists who have published studies linking environmental                exposures with toxicity in humans) will elicit information about                the actors' non-cognitive interests (that is, the social,                       economic, and political stakes in the outcomes), considerations,                and contingencies that attend the decision to launch a new truth                claim through publication.  In addition, a multi-tiered discourse               and content analysis will explore responses of the courts, the                  press, and the scientific community in the two case studies.                                                                                                         This project will contribute to the advancement of                         sociological knowledge about the social construction of                         scientific facts, external influences on adherence to the \"norms                of science,\" and the responsibilities of scientists for others'                 use of their work.  This project also will provide an excellent                 opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop                independent research skills.",
