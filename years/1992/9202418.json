 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liquid aerosol thermolysis (LAT) refers to the general class                    of particle synthesis processes in which a liquid precursor                     solution is atomized into discrete droplets and subsequently                    transported through a time/temperature/atmosphere-regulated                     reactor.  The overall objective of the proposed program is to                   establish a fundamental engineering science for the synthesis                   of submicron, composite particles by liquid aerosol                             thermolysis.  Particle synthesis and solution experiments are                   designed to identify those factors affecting solid composite                    particle formation and chemical distribution.  In situ                          technique will be used to monitor droplets generation and                       shrinkage during the evaporation stage as a function of                         atomization, precursor solution characteristics and                             evaporation conditions.  After the evaporation stage, on-line                   sampling will be used to obtain and characterize particles as                   a function of time and temperature.  Each process step will be                                                                                                  mathematically analyzed using information generated in the                      above experiments and evaluated against existing or derived                     models for those processes.  Model systems, based on alumina                    precursors as the matrix phase, have been selected examine                      first the synthesis of homogeneous composite systems in which                   the nanocrystalline phases are uniformly dispersed and second,                                                                                                  those in which one phase encapsulates the other.  Zinconia and                                                                                                  platinum in alumina allow use to examine issues associated                      with uniform precipitation whereas alumina-SiC allows us the                    possibility to examine the isolation of one phase (SiC)                         within another (i.e. intragranular).                                                                                                                            The proposed techniques aim to production of nanocrystalline                    materials of a wide compositional range and having 100 nm                       crystallinity, of desired uniformity and second phase                           distribution.",
