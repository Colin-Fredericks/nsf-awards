 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in              organometallic chemistry between J.W. Faller of Yale University                 and J.A. Osborn of the University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg,                  France.  The objective of their research is to develop novel,                   efficient asymmetric catalysts for controlling the stereochemistry of           doubled-bonded molecules containing both a heteroatom and carbon                atom.   Specifically they will investigate catalysts for the                    hydrogenation of ketones (acetones) and imines, which are                       ammonia compounds.  Dr. Faller brings to this collaboration                     extensive expertise with the design of stochiometric reagents for               organic synthesis.  This is complemented by the French group's                  experience with hydrogenation catalysts.                                                                                                                        Asymmetric catalysis and catalysts are used to control the                      stereochemistry of compounds.  These catalysts and their reagents               play an essential role in the design of non-toxic drugs and                     pharmaceuticals.  This research will advance our understanding of               the catalytical processes and result in the development of new and              more efficient catalytic reagents.",
