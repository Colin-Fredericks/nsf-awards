 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an investigation of the structural                         characteristics, provenance, and sedimentology of proximal                      synorogenic conglomerates of Late Cretaceous-Paleocene age in                   northeastern Utah.  Because these deposits contain progressive                  structures and well developed unroofing sequences of clast types,               they should be useful for incremental retrodeformation of the NE                Utah thrust belt.  The general questions to be addressed include:               (1) What are the structural characteristics of proximal,                        thrust-derived fans, and can these structures be used to                        retrodeform the conglomerates?  (2) What are the spatial                        relationships between angular unconformities and large-scale                    morphostratigraphic lithosomes in these proximal fans, and can                  these relationships shed new light on interpretations of tectonic               control on sediment distribution during thrust faulting?  (3) What              structures control the production and distribution of sediment in               thrust belts--large scale structural culminations or frontal tip                anticlines?  In addition to these general questions, the proposed               study will address several longstanding regional problems in the                NE Utah thrust belt, such as the location of the southern terminus              of the Crawford thrust and the former extent of the Wilard thrust               sheet.  This study will take an integral approach to working out                the complexities of the linking zone between the thrust belt-proper             and the adjacent basin.  The results of the proposed research will              be of use to structural geologists, foreland-basin stratigraphers               and sedimentologists, and basin modelers.",
