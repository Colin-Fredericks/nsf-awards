 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much current research is directed toward understanding the                 behavior of trace metals in anoxic aquatic environments.  These                 studies create a need for accurate data on the stoichiometry and                stability of metal complexes containing reduced sulfur ligands.                 Many existing stability constants are uncertain at the order of                 magnitude level and thus are far less accurate than the field data              to which they are applied.  In some cases, especially for                       polysulfide or thiol ligands, no data exist.  When data are                     available, it is often uncertain whether the species described are              mononuclear or polynuclear.  This is an insidious problem that can              introduce large, unsuspected errors into predictions of metal                   behavior.  We have completed investigations of copper speciation                in solutions equilibrated with reduced Cu-S assemblages,                        chalcocite+djurleite and anilite+covellite.  This has included                  EXAFS studies which demonstrate that multinuclear complexes exist               in this system.  We have also completed studies of zinc and cadmium             speciation under conditions appropriate for anoxic marine waters.                 We will continue this line of research, focusing in the next two              years on mercury and molybdenum.  Specific objectives are as                    follows:  1) Mercury.  Measure the solubility of cinnabar under                 conditions approaching those in anoxic marine waters and compare                with metacinnabar solubility to determine if polynuclear complexes              exist.  Determine if Hg-polysulfide complexes will be important in              nature.  Investigation the solubility of cinnabar over its solid                solution range, and 2) Molybdenum.  Characterize Fe-Mo-S                        precipitates formed under conditions representative of anoxic                   marine waters by elemental analysis, EXAFS and solubility.                      Investigate the possible importance of thiomolybdates as ligands                for Cu, Zn, Cd and Fe.  Extend preliminary EXAFS work on Mo in                  black shales and seeks links between the products produced in the               laboratory and those preserved in shales from ancient sulfidic                  marine basins.",
