 "awd_abstract_narration": "To gain a better understanding of the storage process in plants,                the PIs will study plants that have evolved in an ecosystem in                  which storage is obviously useful.  The alpine environment is one               in which such a condition exists.  Alpine plants provide unique                 opportunities to study the advantages and costs of resource storage             to plants.  The PIs will use alpine plants as model systems to                  study storage as a general phenomenon.  The study will yield new                information on how storage benefits growth of these plants, what                its costs are in terms of future growth, and how plants can conduct             storage in a competitive environment where soil microorganisms use              the same resources.  The questions addressed in this proposal have              several practical implications.  First, by studying plant survival              in harsh ecosystems, the PIs will learn about adaptations that                  could be useful for plants in agricultural systems.  Second, a                  basic understanding of soil nitrogen transformations can have a                 practical application in agricultural ecosystems.  Finally, the                 approach developed will provide useful information on processes in              alpine ecosystems, an area that may prove quite susceptible to                  global warming and other climate changes.",
