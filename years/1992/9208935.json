 "awd_abstract_narration": "The loss of nitrogen from coastal ecosystems through                            denitrification is believed to be a major sink for nitrogen,                    particularly in eutrophic environments. The focus of this project               is a thick macroalgal canopy that carpets the bottom of Waquoit                 Bay, a eutrophic embayment on Cape Cod, MA. The macroalgal canopy               frequently exceeds a thickness of 15 cm. Within the upper third of              the dense mat, O2 concentrations are high during the day due to                 photosynthesis and NH4+ concentrations are low (several uM). In                 contrast, the lower portion of the canopy is anaerobic even during              the day and NH4+ concentrations are very high (hundreds of uM).                 Therefore, within a zone about 5 cm from the algal surface                      conditions are favorable for nitrification with sufficient O2 from              photosynthesis and diffusion from above and NH4+  diffusing from                below. It is hypothesized that high rates of denitrification may                occur at the high NH+4/low O2 interface within the algal canopy due             to the existence of denitrification-nitrification coupling in this              zone. The hypothesized interaction is in fact a triple coupling of              photosynthesis-nitrification-denitrification. This hypothesis will              be examined in a series of experiments to be conducted at the                   Marine Biological Lab in Woods Hole, MA, a facility close by to                 Waquoit Bay. The project will evaluate nitrification and                        denitrification in specially constructed chambers containing                    sediment, algal canopy material, and overlying water. These                     questions relate directly to ongoing work at Waquoit Bay which is               one of the current sites under investigation through the Land                   Margin Ecosystem Research Program (LMER) and the measurements                   obtained will be an important input into the nitrogen budget of                 this system.",
