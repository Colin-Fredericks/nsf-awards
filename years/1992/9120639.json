 "awd_abstract_narration": "The high level of coordination shown by social insect colonies is               of both economic and theoretical interest:  The social events in                honey bee colonies underlie bees' usefulness as pollinators and                 honey producers, and our ability to manage them successfully.  At               the same time, this coordination presents a special puzzle to                   evolutionary theory, since intra-colony conflict is expected in                 some circumstances.  Genetic differences between individuals in                 colonies mean that any particular way of dividing the colony's                  resources among the reproductives will produce different genetic                payoffs for different individuals, leading to conflicting                       interests between them.                                                                                                                                         This study examines the production of swarms by honey bee                       colonies, with particular attention to the piping behavior of                   queen bees, a phenomenon long observed but never adequately                     explained.  The study tests a hypothesis that worker bees, by                   manipulating the options available, redirect the interests of                   newly-reared queen bees into alignment with the workers' own                    interests.  This turns a situation of conflicting benefits to                   different individuals into one of common, though lesser,                        benefits.  The study tests the role of queen piping as                          communication of the factors that direct this realignment of                    interests.                                                                                                                                                      The research will contribute to a general theory of social                      behavior by testing how selection at the level of individuals can               lead to traits at the level of groups, and how the barriers to                  evolution of highly cooperative behavior may be crossed.  It will               increase our understanding of honey bee reproductive behavior,                  which forms the basis for genetic management of bees.",
