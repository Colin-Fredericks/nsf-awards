 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                         Organo-metallic Chemistry Program, involves the study of                        tellurolate and selenolate ligands with both main group and                     transition metal centers.  The focus is on ligands that contain                 bulky alkyl, silyl or aryl substituents such that monomeric                     complexes are formed.  Studies of the reactivity of these                       complexes will include chalcogenide displacement/substitution,                  insertions into the M-ER (E = Te, Se) bond, reactions of the E                  center, and cleavage of the E-R bond.  The long term objective                  of the research is to put this chemistry on the same basis as                   the much studied alkoxide and sulfide congeners.  The potential                 for use of the molecular chalcogenide compounds as precursors                   for solid-state, materials will be examined as part of the                      project.                                                                        %%%                                                                             This project involves the study of the fundamental chemistry of                 selenium and tellurium.  Unlike the lighter elements in this                    family (the chalcogenides), relatively little attention has                     been given to the molecular chemistry of these elements,                        primarily because of the difficulty of working with them.  This                 is in spite of the fact that they are constituents of                           technologically important devices such as infrared detectors                    rechargeable batteries, photothermic imaging materials and                      photovoltaic solar cells to name a few.  Professor Arnold, an                   excellent synthetic inorganic chemist, has laid the groundwork                  that could lead to some exciting advances in the chemistry of                   these elements and potentially to advances in technology arenas                 as well.",
