 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                        Chemistry Division, Professor Kenneth Janda of the University                   of Pittsburgh will use spectroscopy and high-level calculations                 to study halogen-noble gas van der Waals molecules and small                    clusters in order to deduce information about potential energy                  surfaces.  The work is a mixture of structural and dynamical                    studies which should lead to fundamental information about the                  dynamical pathways of chemical reactions as well as the                         physical transition from gaseous to condensed phases.                           %%%                                                                             Cluster molecules are intermediate species formed during the                    process when gaseous molecules condense to form liquids or                      solids.  The study of the structure and properties of clusters                  is useful in understanding such diverse phenomena as molecular                  orientation and mobility on catalytic surfaces as well as                       protein folding.  The work supported here examines clusters                     forming larger and larger entities in order to test the                         validity of theoretical models such as the use of pair-                         potentials to describe interactions in condensing matter.",
