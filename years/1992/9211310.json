 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motor responses can be modified by incoming sensory information.                In this award, Dr. Kiisa Nishikawa will study the way in which the              brain uses incoming sensory input to modify motor output so that                it becomes appropriate to its current context. The approach for                 solving this fundamental problem will use anuran feeding responses              as a model system. Much is already known about the neural circuits              associated with these responses, and about sensory processing of                stimuli associated with the prey object.  However, the processes                by which motor output is matched to sensory input remain to be                  elucidated. The motor responses require accurate sensory                        recognition and precise localization of the objects as they move                through the visual field. Once these processes of recognition and               localization have been carried out, the brain must produce an                   appropriate motor response oriented in the correct direction at the             correct distance, and the response must occur within a time period              short enough to insure prey capture. In these experiments, the                  sensory feedback systems associated with prey capture will be                   characterized by (1) describing the anatomy of sensory receptors                and their central projections using neuronal tracing and                        immunohistochemical staining; (2) determining the pattern of                    sensory activity during normal feeding using extracellular                      recording from dorsal roots and peripheral nerves; (3) elucidating              how sensory input modulates motor output using deafferentation and              afferent stimulation experiments. Feeding motor patterns will be                studied using high-speed videography, electromyography and                      extracellular recording from peripheral nerves.  This study will                contribute to an understanding of the neural basis of adaptive                  responses and sensory-motor integration.",
