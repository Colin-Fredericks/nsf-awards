 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at Austin conducts three series of Summer               Science Camps annually for 150 African-American and Hispanic                    youths entering the eighth and ninth grades.  Designed to build a               coherent and solid foundation among minority middle schoolers for an            interest in and understanding of science and mathematics, these                 programs are presented in the context of existing Outreach Centers              established by the University in major concentrations of target                 minorities in Austin, Dallas, and the Rio Grande Valley.  The SSC               environment and activities are designed to bring the participant into           immediate and personal contact with the people and \"things\" of                  science, mathematics and technology by having them participate in a             wide range of research processes and interacting with active                    mathematicians, engineers and scientists.  The focus of each of the             SSC's curricula is embodied in a major yearly theme for each site that          is derived from the particular nature of local student populations and          the available resources of that area (e.g. basic foundations, robotics          and space technology, ecology/plant/animal study, and agribusiness              and genetic engineering, etc.).  SSC student participants will interact         with teachers trained in teacher enhancement programs, thus                     matching the middle schoolers with trained science and mathematics              teachers that they will likely encounter in upper middle and high               school.  The ultimate designed outcome of this interaction is the               creation of \"student-teacher allies\" in the academic-year classroom             who are bound together by both shared interest and common                       experience in the science and mathematics learning process.",
