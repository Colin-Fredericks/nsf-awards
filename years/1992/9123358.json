 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will work on a number of problems               in abstract gambling theory, which is a particular formulation of               stochastic control, and on related problems in the theory of two-               person, zero-sum stochastic games.  Some of the research will                   treat fundamental questions about the optimal reward function in                gambling and the value function in stochastic games.  One of                    these questions for a general class of stochastic games is the                  existence of the value.  Some of the research will also treat                   specific stochastic control problems and stochastic games.                      Finally research is also proposed on certain questions which                    arise in the theory of Bayesian statistics.                                          The principal investigator will work on fundamental                        questions about optimal decision making through time in the                     presence of uncertainty.  Abstract gambling theory treats                       problems in which a single decision maker needs to control a                    process so as to attain some well-defined objective.  In                        stochastic games two players have opposing interests and each                   seeks to control the same process but toward opposite ends.  The                mathematical details of such problems can be highly technical,                  but solutions are of interest in many areas including economics,                operations research, and finance.",
