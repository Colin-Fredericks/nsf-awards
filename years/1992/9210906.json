 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed at the investigation of formal mechanisms             to focus the reasoning and handle contradictions in formal common               sense reasoning framework.  An important contribution of the                    research is the framework it will provide for truly real time                   common sense reasoning.  The proposed research is the directed at               enhancing the step logic formalism to provide a formal model to                 real time common sense reasoning.  Step logic is a formalism                    designed to model the ongoing process of deduction.  What makes the             step logic formalism so unique is that the logic explicitly allows              unsound inferences (i.e. contradictions can arise).  This is done               in the interest of efficiency (that is, to avoid the consistency                check problem).  The objectives of the research are to investigate              ways of focusing one's reasoning, to develop a means of focusing                the reasoning of the step logic formalism, to investigate methods               of handling contradictions efficiently, and to develop a more                   general method of handling contradictions within the steplogic                  formalism.  The attainment of these objectives will result in a                 non monotonic reasoning formalism that is not only tractable, but               real time.  The research issues will be addressed both in terms of              theory as well as implementation.",
