 "awd_abstract_narration": "The variability of rainfall rate will be examined over a range          of time and space scales.  The principal topics of the proposed                 research are the probability transformations of rainfall rate from              the plot scale, at which physical process representations can be                applied for land surface processes, to the observation scale of                 climatological remote sensing systems, and from the observation                 scale to the climate model scale.  A statistical model of raindrop              processes (Smith \u01311991!) will be used to examine these                          transformations.  The model of raindrop processes yields a                      stochastic/dynamic representation of rainfall rate and provides a               unified framework for studying land surface processes related to                rainfall rate and atmospheric processes related to remote sensing               measurements of rainfall.  In this study, empirical and theoretical             analyses will be carried out for rainfall rate and raindrop                     processes.  The lognormal cascade theory of Gupta and Waymire                   \u01311990! will play an important role in both empirical and                        theoretical scaling analyses.  Two principal problems will be                   examined:                                                                                                                                                               *How do distributional properties of rainfall rate and                          raindrop processes vary with scale?                                             *How does rainfall rate depend on raindrop processes and how                    does this relationship vary with scale?                                                                                                                 An important element of this project is development of statistical              procedures for assessing scale properties of rainfall and raindrop              processes.  The project will be an interdisciplinary effort                     involving hydrologists and statisticians.  The proposed research                will provide analytical tools for testing and refining the                      \"probability distributed method\" for representing land surface                  processes in climate models (Entekhabi and Eagleson \u01311989!).                    Empirical studies will center on the southern plains regions of the             U.S. and utilize radar data, rain gage data and surface drop-size               data (including data from a network of disdrometers that will be                deployed for the 1992 STORM field experiment).  Surface drop-size               data from a number of climatic regions in the U.S. will also be                 used for empirical studies.",
