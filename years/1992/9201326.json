These                                             effects are  usually complicated by                                             the three-dimensional aspects of                                                the problem, including impact with                                              coastal structures and propagation                                              over the nearshore bathymetry; to                                               which these long waves are highly                                               responsive.  Most of the existing                                               research on tsunami run-up is                                                   primarily two-dimensional:  There                                               is a need to make advances in                                                   experimental and numerical                                                      techniques so as to understand the                                              three-dimensional features of                                                   tsunami run-up.
