 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structure-property relationships in engineering materials is the                broad area of interest of the P.I.  Current work falls into three               categories: solidification processing of alloys and metal-matrix                composites, toughening mechanisms in nonferrous alloys and ceramic              composites, and the study of the structural changes in friction                 materials.  Analytical work in the area of solidification                       processing has focused on the two dimensional simulation of the                 phenomenon of microsegregation in alloy castings.  Finite element               and finite difference techniques are employed to investigate                    transient temperature and composition profiles and to determine the             interface morphology for alloys and pure metals, including natural              convection effects, the heat storage effect in the mold media, and              the dissipation of the surface wave during mold filling.  The                   algorithms, developed from first principles of mass, momentum and               energy, yield results which agree well with those reported in the               literature.  Future plans in this area involve the extension of                 this work to three dimensions and the placement of reinforcing                  fibers in the mushy zone of the alloy during the solidification                 simulation.  Combined analytical and experimental techniques are                employed to study the deformation and toughening mechanism in                   ceramic matrix composites.  The results of the limited experimental             investigations are used in the two dimensional finite element model             of the crack intersecting a single fiber in the composite.  In the              third category during the application of friction, the materials                experience local hot spots which themselves cause changes in the                structure of the materials.  The characterization of these changes              and their effect on the production of noise during braking are                  being studied using semimet materials.",
