 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systems of human social interaction can be studied from                    various perspectives, one of which is rational action.  Under                   this approach, individuals are viewed as decision-makers who try                to maximize their utility through choices among behavioral                      options.  These decisions are based on limited information about                other people and events in the environment.  This project focuses               on n-person games, that is, on multi-person decisions where each                of the participants (or players) have interests that need not                   coincide with those of others.  The primary goal of the project                 is to expand a new theory, called the central union theory, that                predicts outcomes in a large class of n-person games with a high                degree of accuracy.  An examples of an outcome predicted by the                 theory are the probability that a certain coalition structure                   comes into place.  The prediction of the theory will be tested on               a large amount of empirical data from laboratory experimental                   studies of n-person games.                                                           This highly theoretical and mathematical project will expand               and test a promising new theory about n-person cooperative games.               A very valuable aspect of the project is its emphasis on the                    ability of the theory to predict empirical outcomes, rather than                examining them only at the abstract level.",
