 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well established that rock at depth can deform in either             (or both) a ductile or brittle fashion in response to the passage               of a more fluid material (magma, water, salt, etc.).  Empirically,              the greater the viscosity contrast between the host rock and the                fluid moving around, the more likely one is to find the fluid in                narrow cracks and dikes, and the less likely one is to find it in               diapirs and plutions.  Although this observation is intuitively                 appealing, as yet there has been little effort to quantify the role             of host/fluid viscosity contrast in determining the geologic                    regimes under which dike intrusion is likely or possible.  The PI               will study the dike/diapir transition be treading dikes as                      propagating, fluid-filled cracks in viscoelastic host rock.  The                results, in addition to being of general geologic interest, should              find particular application to a number of important questions and              processes.  These include the buoyant rise of granitic and                      serpentinite bodies along faults, the question of whether                       pluton/crustal viscosity contrasts are such that granities can                  ascend via a combination of fracture and flow, at rates greater                 than that of the Stoke's flow solution ( and hence traverse more                of the crust before freezing), and the upwelling of buoyant                     asthenosphere between diverging (rifting) lithospheric blocks.",
