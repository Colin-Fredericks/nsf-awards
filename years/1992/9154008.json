 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer programming has gained great popularity in elementary and              secondary education because it has been as a powerful tool by which             children can develop general problem solving skills and learn                   fundamental concepts in mathematics, physics, and logistics, as                 well acquiring foundational understanding of computer science.                  Unfortunately, research assessing these claims has found that                   students fail to attain sufficient programming competence to serve              as a basis for the development of general problem solving skills.               In addition, both research and the practical experiences of expert              software designers have suggested that the analysis of the problem              domain and the design of an overall plan of the software are more               central to the development of software than is learning to code.                Students in programming courses that emphasize design learn more                than students in other courses, but they still show little progress             toward general problem solving.  Recently developed technology has              simplified the relation between the analysis and design phase,                  making it feasible to teach students software design without first              teaching them how to code.  This project proposes to teach design               without coding and to evaluate critically the efficacy of such an               approach.  If successful, this project will serve as a model that               can be developed both for introductory computer science courses and             for computer literacy courses.",
