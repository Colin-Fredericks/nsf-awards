 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the Experimental Health Psychology Laboratory                        project is to provide undergraduates with the opportunity to                    investigate interactions among various factors implicated in                    the etiology and progression of disease and in the promotion of                 health. The laboratory equipment includes a carbon monoxide                     analyzer, a breath alcohol analyzer, an accelerometer-based                     physical activity monitor, an ambulatory blood pressure and                     heart rate monitor, and a personal computer for data retrieval.                 Behavioral risk factors including cigarette smoking, alcohol                    intake, and sedentary lifestyle are known to contribute to the                  development of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in                 the United States.  This laboratory will give students the                      chance to design and implement experiments that will explore                    interactions among psychological, behavioral, and physiological                 factors that may contribute to the development of disease.                      Undergraduate training in Health Psychology is becoming                         increasingly common, but the incorporation of extensive                         laboratory experience in this training has not been previously                  reported.",
