 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to provide a better understanding                  of nucleation processes, and to allow us to make accurate                       quantitative predictions.  The research will be in three                        somewhat different but complementary fields of investigation:                   ion induced nucleation, nucleation of metal vapors, and                         homogeneous nucleation.  The P. I. has developed a new method                   for measuring the ion induced nucleation rate in which all the                  important variables (supersaturation, temperature, and ion                      density) are accurately known and all can be readily changed.                   Initial measurements on n-nonane and 1-hexanol will be                          repeated to decrease their uncertainty, optimize conditions                     and extend them to a wider range of supersaturations and to                     several temperatures.  Studies of more complex substances such                  as those with quadropole moments or high polarizabilities                       (e.g. CS2, CC14) will also be made.  A second major focus will                  be the homogenous nucleation of metal vapors.  Metals in their                  dilute vapor state are nonmetallic, resulting in a cluster                      size dependence of the nonmetal transition.  Nucleation                         studies of metals not only will enable one to study this                        phenomena at temperatures far below the critical temperature                    (and thus at temperatures where the change in density is                        essentially discontinuous), but also will test the validity of                  nucleation theories on a class of substances very different                     from any studied until now.  The focus will be a joint effort                   of this research group and a research group at Phillips                         University in Marburg, Germany headed by Prof. F. Hensel and                    Dr. H. Uchtmann.  A third focus will be continued efforts on                    understanding homogeneous nucleation processes.  This will                      include studies on various substances over a wide range of                      rates, 10-6 to 101 nuclei cm-3 s-1.  Phase change form vapor to                 the liquid phase by nucleation plays a key role in a wide                       variety.",
