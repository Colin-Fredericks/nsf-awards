 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this program is to gather information about the climate          for women in physics departments across the country and to feed this            information back to these departments, accompanied by suggestions               outlining how each department can assess its own climate and then act           to improve it.  General information about climate issues will be                obtained by producing, distributing, and analyzing questionnaires for           undergraduate and graduate students.  These will seek to identify the           special problems and concerns of women students.  More specific                 information about climate issues will be obtained by visits by four or          five physics faculty, predominantly women, to 10 physics departments            offering both graduate and undergraduate physics programs.  Each visit          will be by invitation by the department and the university.  A written          report by the visiting team to the physics department will follow each          visit.  Six months after the visit, the department will be requested            to provide feedback on changes that have resulted from the visit.  At           the end of the grant period, the results of the national questionnaire          and a summary report of the 10 visits will be available to the physics          community.  The principal investigators will also prepare a report on           the project that will be distributed widely.",
