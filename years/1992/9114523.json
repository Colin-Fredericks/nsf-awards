 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with damping of dynamic systems by means of                 thin fluid layers and jet flow impingement.  Vibration in                       mechanical systems is an increasingly inhibiting factor in the                  quest for higher efficiency and productivity, factors which often               translate as increased speed and light weight moving components.                In earlier work, the principal investigator has demonstrated that               damping obtained through the use of fluid layers is particularly                effective at low frequencies.  This project expands on that                     earlier work and attempts to enhance the damping effects achieved               therein.  Two topics are investigated here, comprising edge                     effects and free jet impingement effects.  For the first topic,                 an effort will be made to make the edge effects (steady vortex                  and jetting) a dominant contributor to the damping.  For the                    second topic, the plan is to study the damping resulting from the               interaction of a vibrating surface with free jets impinging on                  it.  The project contains an experimental component to verify the               analytical aspects of the research.",
