 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop models and analysis algorithms for               access control systems.  Architectures for implementing these systems           will also be investigated.  Access control systems mediate (i)                  operations on data objects (e.g., user A reads file F), as well as              (ii) control operations which alter access permissions (e.g., user A            authorizes user B to read file F).  In current systems all, but the             most rudimentary, control operations are typically centralized in a             single authority (viz., the system administrator).  This project will           investigate systems where such authorization is decentralized and               itself subject to change.  Harrison, Ruzzo and Ullman (HRU) proposed a          general model for this purpose.  Unfortunately, their model has                 extremely weak safety properties (i.e., it is undecidable or                    computationally infeasible to determine whether a given user can ever           acquire a particular privilege).  Subsequently a number of models with          varying expressiveness and analyzability were published.  Recent                results by Ammann and Sandhu for their Extended Schematic Protection            Model strongly indicate that the pessimistic results of HRU can be              circumvented.  This project will build on previous work by the                  principal investigators.  It will develop and analyze new access                control models with the objective of analyzing their safety                     properties, expressive power, fundamental constructs and                        implementation issues.",
