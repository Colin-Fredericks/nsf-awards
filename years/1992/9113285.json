 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Donald Winget and others (including                     graduate students) of the University of Texas at Austin to                      collaborate in astrophysics research with Dr. Michel Breger and his             group at the Institute of Astronomy, University of Vienna.  The                 two research groups have been operating two independent                         international telescope networks for measuring features of stars of             very different ages:  the Delta Scuti Network (Austria) and the                 Whole Earth Telescope Network (Texas).  The networks are                        similar in their goal of completely resolving the brightness                    variations of complex pulsating stars into their component                      frequencies for seismological study of stellar interiors.  However              the networks are currently completely different and complementary               in the frequency domains that they cover.  The goal of the                      collaboration proposed for support here is to integrate the two                 networks and software, personnel, and analytical methods.  The                  participants will then be able to measure simultaneously several                selected stars in extreme states of stellar evolution.                                                                                                          The work that provides the basis for this proposal has broken new               ground in the field of stellar physics through studies of the Sun.              The techniques and approach being employed have opened a whole                  new level of study of stellar dynamics and evolution, by probing                the internal structure of stars using networks of observations and              applying seismological theory.  The expanded collaboration offers a             unique opportunity to advance this research.",
