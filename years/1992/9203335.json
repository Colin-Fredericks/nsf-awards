The additional funding provided in this award will allow the US                 scientists to work with Chinese scientists who are conducting                   another experiment, in China, which exposes photographic emulsion               to cosmic rays.  Data produced by the Chinese experiment is                     complementary to the data from the US experiment, and through                   this collaboration, both groups will have ready access to each                  body of data for comparison.  The Chinese facility is located in                Tibet, and without cooperation of this kind, it would be unlikely               that US scientists would have access to the data obtained there.                Chinese scientists will also visit the US to work directly with                 the team of scientists at the US facility in Utah.",
