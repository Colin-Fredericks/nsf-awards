 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research leading to the                development of various aspects of harmonic analysis with a view                 toward applications to problems in linear and nonlinear partial                 differntial equations.  The main emphasis will be on the study of               elliptic boundary value problems on domains with rough                          boundaries.  More precisely, the boundaries are not required to                 have a continuously turning tangent.  They may have corners but                 not cusps.  These are effectively the minimal conditions one                    might impose in physical representations where imprecise                        measurements always lead to a loss of smoothness.  Results on                   homogeneous equations in any dimension are considered well                      developed.  Not so are the inhomogeneous problems.  In fact, in                 two dimensions there is a Dirichlet problem for which the                       fundamental estimate comparing the gradient with the boundary                   values does not hold.  Work will now be done on the corresponding               inhomogeneous Neumann problem to see if the estimates can be                    obtained for functions in appropriate Sobolev spaces.  A second                 line of research, more geometric, concerns the question of                      estimating a Riemannian metric in terms of the spectrum of it s                 associated Laplacian.  In particular, work will be done in                      estimating the metric of a three-manifold in terms of its                       spectral data with no restriction on the manifold's conformal                   class.  This will be done by constructing a function whose                      quadratic norm dominates the Riemannian measure.  The                           construction requires the solution of a specific differential                   inequality on the manifold.                                                          Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them.",
