 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to provide travel fellowships to young American                   scientists to participate in an international symposium on avian                endocrinology to be held in Edinburgh, Scotland on September                    14-17th, 1992.  State-of-the-art lectures will be held on a broad               spectrum of topics from molecular to behavioral endocrinology.  The             emphasis of the symposium is on the integration of molecular                    approaches with the organismal level of analysis.  In addition, the             forum is organized to encourage and promote the interchange of                  ideas between the young scientists and well-established, senior                 investigators from all over the world.  Indeed a goal is to bring               together the researchers that are developing molecular probes with              those that can provide insights as to potential experimental                    applications of these tools.  Some very important initial                       discoveries have been made using avian model systems because it is              in these species that molecular, cellular, behavioral, and                      ecological aspects of hormone action are best integrated.  The                  integration from molecular to organismic levels could lead to a                 better understanding of basic mechanisms underlying physiology and              behavior.  The proceedings will be published in a book.",
