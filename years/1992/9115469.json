 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Hantman, Mr. Michael Klein                   will conduct research for his doctoral dissertation.  He will                   analyze ceramic materials collected from 43 Native American sites               located in the James and Potomac Rivers region of Virginia and                  Maryland and will focus on the period between 500 - 1600 AD.  The               goal of the project is to develop a ceramic chronology - to                     understand how ceramics changed in form over time - and the                     selected sample which derives entirely from radiocarbon dated                   sites will make this possible.  On this basis, an archaeologist                 will then be able to take pottery from undated sites in the                     region and determine its age through comparison to the controlled               sequence.  Since most pottery in the Chesapeake region is neither               decorated nor painted, Mr. Klein will focus on attributes such as               sherd thickness and the tempering material used.  Ceramics which                form the basis of this research are housed in East Coast museums                and Mr. Klein will make a series of trips to visit them.                                                                                                        The Chesapeake region is unusual because of the richness of the                 resources available to prehistoric peoples and relatively little                is known about how technologically simple societies developed in                such environments.  Archaeological evidence indicates that during               the 1100 year span which Mr. Klein's study includes, societies                  were transformed from small scale hunting and gathering groups to               large centralized chiefdoms which relied on agriculture.  Before                one can understand the process which underlies this                             transformation, it is first necessary to place archaeological                   sites in time and Mr. Klein's research will help to achieve this                goal.                                                                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons.  It will increase               our understanding of prehistoric Native Americans and the                       processes which led to the emergence of cultural complexity.  It                will provide a tool useful to many archaeologists and will assist               in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
