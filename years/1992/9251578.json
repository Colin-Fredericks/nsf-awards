 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last 30 years optics has undergone a revivification,                     driven to a large extent by the application of lasers and                       computers.  The manifestations of what has been a real                          revolution are evident everywhere from credit-card holograms to                 high-resolution television.  With few exceptions, this                          technological whirlwind is predicated on advances that are not                  well understood outside the immediate confines of the                           discipline.  Accordingly, we have begun to create a Modern                      Optics Teaching Environment (MOTE) where all undergraduates can                 learn about, and indeed experience, at least the basics of                      these developments and where physics majors can get a state-of-                 the-art introduction to contemporary optics.                                                                                                                    Spectroscopy is the window into the machinery of the atom and                   is central to the pedagogical development of modern physics and                 optics.  Accordingly, one of the most highly used pieces of                     equipment in the MOTE is a 1.0 m research-grade monochromator.                  Studies of sources are conducted using Fabry-Perot and                          Michelson interferometers.  The MOTE focuses on the laser                       inasmuch as it is one of the premiere and most ubiquitous                       instruments in the exploration of contemporary physics.                         Students build gas and dye lasers and study their operating                     characteristics.  Once the fundamentals of radiant energy are                   familiar, and the laser as a versatile source is mastered,                      applications to nonlinear optics, holography, spectroscopy, and                 fiber optics are explored with confidence.  Seniors also                        perform thesis research in laser spectroscopy using a pulsed                    nitrogen laser and a pumped dye laser.",
