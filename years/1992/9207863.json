 "awd_abstract_narration": "In developing countries such as India, as much as one-third                of the population lives below the poverty line.  Since most of                  the poor live in rural areas, national and state governments have               directed their economic development policies for alleviating                    poverty to rural localities.  The relative success of alleviating               poverty is geographically variant and seems to be related to the                constraining and enabling effects of the local ruling class.                    This project will attempt to answer why programs for the                        alleviation of poverty in rural India are more successful in some               villages and states than in others, and it offers a theoretical                 framework for evaluating this geographical variation.  Two                      specific rural development programs will be examined.  A                        multivariate analysis will establish the degree to which sub-                   districts with high levels of success in implementation of these                programs have lower incidence of poverty.  Areas of very high and               very low success rates will be studied in detail in terms of the                relations among local state officials, local ruling classes, and                party leaders, and local organizations representing lower                       classes.  Unstructured interviews and data from local archives                  will serve to illustrate that local variation in policy                         implementation success rates depends upon local social and                      political structures.                                                                The results from this project should demonstrate the                       relative importance of local elites, bureaucracies and                          organizations representing the poor in explaining the                           geographical variation in the success of various policies to                    alleviate local poverty.  These results will have important                     implications for rural economic development policy makers in                    developing nations in terms of designing implementation programs                to raise the standard of living of large numbers of poor                        households.",
