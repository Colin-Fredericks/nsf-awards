The applicability of randomized algorithms for query                optimization is investigated or several types of database                       systems, e.g., relational, object-oriented, and parallel systems.               Emphasis is placed on identifying the abstract characteristics of               cost functions and data models that determine the effectiveness                 of such algorithms.  Of special concern is also the propagation                 of errors in parameters that affect the query optimizer's                       decisions.  This research leads to developing techniques for                    query optimization in future systems where current technology                   is inadequate.  Another focus of this work is the study of                      specialized database systems for managing data from scientific                  experiments.  The emphasis is on graphical user interfaces and                  semantic heterogeneity. Collaborating scientists from many                      disciplines provide guidelines for the goals of this effort based               on the needs of their laboratories.  This research develops tools               that enables such scientists to use database technology                         effectively for their experiments.  Although this work is driven                by the specific needs of scientific databases, its results can be               applied to solve many similar problems faced by next generation                 database systems in general.",
