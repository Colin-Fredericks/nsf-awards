 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the 20th century, geophysics moved from industrial laboratories              and endowed research facilities into the university.  It was one                of the last major branches of physical science in the United States             to do so.  The transformation of geophysics into a university-based             discipline challenged geologists, geophysicists, and university                 administrators who wrestled with the sharp conflict between solid               earth geophysicists and field geologists over proper methodological             approaches and the daunting diversity of geophysics' component                  fields.  Geophysicists sought to develop academic facilities in                 part to approach complex problems such as the nature of the Earth's             core through interdisciplinary contacts readily available at                    universities.  Its leaders also sought to develop professional                  centers for training new recruits to the field.  By the 1960s, the              rapid growth of geophysics reshaped existing departments of                     geological sciences and reoriented the study of geological                      phenomena.  Yet because the history of geophysics remains largely               unexplored, little is known about these significant and far-                    reaching changes.  Given the importance of interdisciplinary                    research in modern science, the subject merits special attention.               Dr. Doel is concentrating on the period from the early 1920s                    through the 1960s, utilizing the growth of solid earth geophysics               to explore several broad themes including discipline formation, the             development of American research universities, and the influence                of patronage and institutional settings on the production of                    scientific knowledge.                                                                                                                                           This study is being undertaken at the Center for History of Physics             of the American Institute of Physics (AIP).  The AIP is playing an              important role in this project, including the preservation of                   historical \"raw data\" such as unpublished correspondence,                       institutional records, and tape-recorded recollections, using                   methods AIP has developed for similar projects in other fields.",
