 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns a long-standing collaboration with John              Cantwell into the structure of foliations of codimension-1,                     especially on closed 3-manifolds.  It grows directly out of their               theory of levels (1978), which has influenced not only their own                work, but that of the French and Japanese schools as well.  The                 main direction will be to explore the deep relations between the                topology of knot complements and taut, finite depth foliations.  A              major tool in this investigation will be the \"generalized Poincare-             Bendixson\" theory developed by the investigator and Cantwell as                 part of the theory of levels.  The lowest level of complexity is                that of a fibered knot, here called a \"depth-zero knot.\"  These                 knots are relatively rare, have been studied classically, and are               relatively well understood.  The next level of complexity is                    exhibited by the depth-one knots, which are very numerous (as shown             in David Gabai's thesis) and present many interesting questions.                Depth-one knots are currently the focus of this project, and                    results already obtained confirm their interest.  Other questions               to be studied relate the degree of smoothability of taut foliations             to topology.  Although smoothness questions have not particularly               concerned 3-manifold topologists, a strong case can be made that                their relevance to topology is deep.  In a rather different                     direction, the proposer remains interested in the ergodic theory of             foliations, especially of exceptional minimal sets, and the related             question of whether the Godbillon-Vey invariant detects such                    minimal sets (almost certainly not).                                                 A foliation of a manifold is a way of filling the manifold                 with lower dimensional pieces.  In the case of a codimension-one                foliation, these pieces are of dimension one less than that of the              given manifold.  Think of an onion or an artichoke.  The topology               of a manifold is strongly related to the kind of foliation which it             will support, and in skillful hands this relation has been forged               into a powerful tool for investigating the topology of manifolds.               It is an unintuitive fact that the major algebraic tools for                    investigating the topology of manifolds work best in the case of                high dimensional manifolds.  The geometric tool afforded by                     foliations is thus particularly welcome in the case of low                      dimensional manifolds.  A major instance of this is the                         investigation of the complement of a knot in the three-dimensional              sphere, which turns out to be an important way to gain information              about the knot itself.",
