 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last few years, several cosmic-ray-produced                         radionuclides (10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl), as well as stable, 3He, Ne and           22Ne have been discovered in terrestrial surface materials.  Some of            these nuclides are already employed as tracers in studies of                    geophysical and geological phenomena and open up a new field of                 study and are expected to provide essential data on rates of change             in global change research.  Such studies require an accurate                    knowledge of the production rates, present and past, which are not              currently available.  The relevant excitation functions for                     different nuclides are not known.  A simulation of the cosmic ray               flux is a rather complex endeavor.  We propose a direct method for              the determination of some of present production rates, by exposing              relevant targets at mountain altitudes.  Production rates averaged              over the last solar cycles can be obtained by comparing production              rates with neutron monitor data.  We propose to determine the                   relevant production ratio P21/P26 of the cosmic-ray- produced                   nuclides 21Ne and 26Al by isotopic measurements of Ne in quartz                 samples.  Average production rates over 104-105 years can be                    obtained from measurements of samples of known age.  Measurements               of the 3He/21Ne ratio show and that 3He is often incompletely                   retained in quartzites.  Therefore, 21Ne production rates and                   21Ne/10Be and 21Ne/Al ratios provide essential information, which is            required to evaluate erosion rates and to define geological                     processes (uplift, variations in ice cover etc).",
