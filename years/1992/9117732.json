The success achieved with schools                                               in California is considered by many                                             to be an excellent example of                                                   hazards mitigation at its best by                                               increasing the seismic safety of                                                buildings and facilities.

Both sets of issues                                                are addressed in order to develop a                                             comprehensive, viable strategy for                                              seismic hazard mitigation in                                                    existing schools.                                                                                                                                               The project is divided into three                                               component parts.  The first                                                     examines the status of seismic                                                  exposure and current maintenance                                                and retrofit procedures of school                                               facilities in eight selected                                                    jurisdictions in Seismic Zones 2                                                and 3.  The second is a review and                                              analysis of the California                                                      experience of seismic hazard                                                    reduction in schools over the past                                              50-plus years to better understand                                              the economic, political, and                                                    administrative factors which                                                    facilitated program completion.                                                 The third component of the project                                              is based on the analysis of current                                             maintenance and retrofit procedures                                             and the specialized California                                                  experience to develop guidelines                                                for economically feasible and                                                   socially acceptable strategies for                                              seismic hazard reduction in                                                     existing school buildings.",
