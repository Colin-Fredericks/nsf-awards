The summer activities will                      include lectures on the ancient arts of chemistry and the                       evolution of the field up through the development of modern                     chemistry.  The laboratory and demonstration portion of the                     project will include the classic experiments of chemistry.                      The best of the materials developed by the teachers in the                      summer will be edited and published for use in the follow-up                    and outreach activities the teachers will conduct during the                    next academic year.  These outreach activities are supported                    by the resources provided by the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship                      Foundation.                                                                                                                                                     The matching funds for the summer portion of the project                        amount to about 6% of the NSF grant.  The matching funds for                    the outreach portion of the project exceeds 300% of the NSF                     grant.",
