 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science information systems is the construction and study of                 complete computer systems to support scientific research.   This                project is building a model \"electronic community system\", a                    digital library containing all the knowledge of a community of                  molecular biologists and a software environment to manipulate this              library across the NSFNET, with the first release currently running             in 20 biology laboratories.                                                                                                                                        Several studies are being pursued in collaboration to                        investigate technology and sociology issues in constructing                     electronic communities.  An \"information space\" is the                          representation used to support uniform transparent retrieval from               many distributed data sources; it consists of uniform objects which             package items from the sources and interconnect them to form a                  relationship graph.  There are data model issues in providing                   uniformity across multiple data types and network caching issues in             providing transparency of interaction across wide-area networks.                There are also information retrieval issues in supporting                       semantic-based retrieval from an automatically generated                        representation which includes a domain-specific thesaurus.                      Finally, there are sociological issues in how the communication                 patterns of the community change with significant electronic                    support.",
