 "awd_abstract_narration": "Standard practice in animal communication studies is to define                  signal units subjectively.  In this pilot study, the researchers                will explore the feasibility of using recently developed                        quantitative methods to define objectively the basic signal units               (notes) in the vocalizations of a monophyletic group of birds                   (chickadees).  After assessing the performance of the computer-                 based SIGNAL Sound Analysis System, they will assess intra-                     population and inter-population variation in several common notes               of representative species.  They will then define the entire                    repertoire of a previously unstudied species in a hierarchical                  manner by examining clusters of similar combinations of note-                   types.  Finally, they will assess the feasibility of using vocal                data for phylogenetic reconstruction.  If these preliminary                     studies are favorable, they will propose a follow-up project                    using these methods to reconstruct the evolution of vocal                       complexity in chickadees.                                                                                                                                       This study, should it prove generally successful, will clarify                  hypothesized analogies between human and animal communication                   systems.  For example, human phonemes and animal note-types                     function similarly as basic units of differentiable sound.                      Although human and animal communication systems differ                          quantitatively in the amount of information they can encode, they               may have converged evolutionarily on a generally optimal                        organizational framework founded on a few dozen distinct sounds.                This similarity suggests that similar constraints on perceptual                 processing of sound operate in both systems.",
