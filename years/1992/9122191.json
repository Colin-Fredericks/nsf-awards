 "awd_abstract_narration": "The standard story of the emergence of the modern industrial world              is that in Britain between 1770 and 1850 there were two                         revolutions: the first and better known, the Industrial Revolution;             and the second, the Agricultural Revolution.  There remains,                    however, an unresolved dispute about the nature of the Agricultural             Revolution and its relationship to the Industrial Revolution.                   Agriculture from 1700 to 1850 experienced important organizational              changes with the elimination of almost all common field villages                and the decline of self-contained peasant farms in favor of large               \"capitalist\" farms which employed most of the rural populations as              wage laborers.  Two interpretations -mainstream and Marxist- share              the perspective that the reorganization of agriculture from small,              peasant open field farms to large-scale, enclosed, capitalist farms             was the major source of productivity advance in Britain, and the                reason why British agricultural productivity far exceeded the rest              of Europe.  Where the views differ is over the mechanism by which               this reorganization increased productivity and the effects it had               on the peasantry.  This research will help to settle this long                  lasting dispute, and it will also provide useful insights into the              process of economic growth and development.                                                                                                                     Specifically, the purpose of this project is to collect and analyze             a large new set of data for English agriculture for the period 1600             to 1850 which will contain observations on the market rental value              of agricultural land, the rate of return on capital, and rural                  wages.  At least 21,000 observations on market land rents will be               collected for the period 1600 to 1837.  With this date set it will              be possible to shed light on several important questions about the              Agricultural Revolution in England such as:  When did occur?  How               important was it to the Industrial Revolution?  How important were              property rights changes during that period?  What was the mechanism             by which yields and labor productivity increased?  How important                was the expulsion of surplus labor from agriculture in creating the             Industrial Revolution?",
