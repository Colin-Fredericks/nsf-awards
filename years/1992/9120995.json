 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to build an efficient, comprehensive and            usable environment for design, verification, and implementation of              concurrent systems.  The system, which will cater to protocol                   engineers and software developers, will support process algebra as its          underlying formalism and have the following features:                                                                                                             o  A graphical user interface that will allow the non-expert to                    design and simulate concurrent systems using process algebra.                                                                                                o  A suite of design and analysis algorithms for concurrent systems;               care will be taken to ensure that implementations of these                      algorithms will be efficient enough to be used on real-life                     systems.                                                                                                                                                     o  A graphical compiler that will transform the graphic designs                    produced on the system into Ada or Occam programs.  This will                   relieve the user of the burden of manually recoding their designs               in the target language of their final system.                                                                                                                o  A uniform intermediate representation that will serve as the                    input format for all the tools in the system.  Basing the                       representation on a widely recognized format, such as BLIF-MV or                KISS2, will promote the exchange of tools with industrial and                   academic institutions.                                                                                                                                     The system, the Concurrency Factory, will be written in C++ and                 execute under X-Windows so that it will be efficient, easily                    extendible, and highly portable.  Moreover, all objects manipulated by          the system will be stored in an object-oriented database, for                   efficient and uniform access.                                                                                                                                   Realization of the Factory will require research in numerous areas              including efficient algorithms for design and verification, with                particular emphasis on techniques for state-space management and                compositional analysis; computation of diagnostic information and its           graphical presentation; and methods for compiling graphical                     descriptions of process algebra expressions into languages such as Ada          and Occam.",
