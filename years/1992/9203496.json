 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small phytoplankton play a major role in the primary production of              the oceans.  The unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus is a                  prominent and important member of this community that can reach                 cell densities of more than 100 thousands cells per liter, achieve              in situ growth rates of 3 doubling per day and as a result may                  contribute between 5 and 25% of the total primary productivity in               the temperate and tropical oceans.  Studies to date indicate that               Synechococcus is grazed at rates comparable to its growth rate and              that microflagellates are the major group responsible for turning               over Synechococcus biomass.  Synechococcus has a characteristic                 discontinuous pattern of diel growth both in nature and in culture              that can be monitored by direct and indirect methods.  Results of               experiments measuring both growth and grazing rates of                          Synechococcus in the Sargasso Sea led to the hypothesis that                    grazing of Synechococcus by microflagellates can be periodic,                   occurring primarily at night.  To test this hypothesis, Dr.                     Waterbury will isolate and characterize the microflagellates                    responsible for Synechococcus turnover and document their impact on             the temporal patterns of Synechococcus abundance.  The project will             be conducted in both inshore and open-ocean waters and will                     experimentally employ culture techniques, direct and indirect                   measurements of in situ growth and grazing rates using direct cell              counts, and C-14 bicarbonate incorporation.  The significance of                this study extends beyond simply furthering our understanding of                the ecology of marine Synechococcus spp.  This unicellular                      photosynthetic bacterium is an important component of the marine                microbial food web. Insights concerning the identity of                         Synechococcus grazers and patterns and rates of grazing on                      Synechococcus can act as a model for and provide important insights             into the workings of the \"microbial loop\".//",
