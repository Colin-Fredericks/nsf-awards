In particular, we will determine the size                    distribution of impact melt spherules, both as a function of                    stratigraphic height and with distance from their source; determine             the compositions of impact melt spherule glasses, whether they vary             with stratigraphic height or with distance from their source, and               infer their provenance based on their compositions; determine the               distribution of shocked mineral phases (such as quartz, feldspar,               and spinel) with stratigraphic height and infer their provenance;               use this information to determine criteria which can be used to                 assess whether a deposit of boundary sediments is undisturbed or                has been reworked; and determine the overall thicknesses of                     undisturbed boundary sediments.  These observations of boundary                 sediments will be coupled with theoretical calculations of ejecta               transport.  The combined studies should identify the approximate                location of the source crater and the lithologies of the target                 material, both of which should determine whether the Chicxulub                  structure, which we have proposed to be the location of a terminal              Cretaceous impact, is a viable candidate.  The study should also                have wide application to the deposition of ejecta from large (>100              km) craters, a subject which is poorly understood at the present                time.",
