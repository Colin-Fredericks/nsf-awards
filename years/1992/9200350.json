Both topics are of great interest               to agricultural and biological engineering students.  Activities                in composting organic materials and flow paths and associated                   biodegradation in field soils are planned.  The program is divided              into a summer and academic year program.  An environment where                  learning and sharing of experiences is encouraged is provided.  The             learning will occur during formal seminars and informal meetings                between fellows, professors and their research group.  During the               summer program, fellows will be housed together and dinners are                 shared with various members of the research team.",
