 "awd_abstract_narration": "George Awad, an artisan noted for his superb architectural                      models turned his talent to pursue his personal fascination                     with science and astronomy.  The results was a preliminary                      prototype of a stunningly detailed and beautiful exhibit                        called \"Model of the Universe by Powers of Ten\".  A special                     showing of the exhibit by the Planetary Society drew rave                       reviews from an audience of noted scientists and science                        educators.  Preliminary showings at the Montshire Museum of                     Science and at the Smithsonian's Experimental Gallery                           demonstrated its unusual appeal withthe general public, and a                   second modified and larger version has been created by Mr.                      Awad.                                                                           Montshire Museum of Science proposes to collaborate with the                    Maryland Science Center and with Mr. Awad to 1) further refine                  the two existing prototype exhibits, 2) develop companion                       interpretive materials to more fully convey the astronomical                    and mathematical concepts implicit in the exhibits, and 3)                      display the two prototypes at the two collaborating museum                      sites and evaluate their effective with the public.  This work                  is intended to guide the proposed creation (not part of this                    proposal) of a permanent and much larger-scale \"Universe\"                       exhibit designed to be circulated among major science museums.//",
