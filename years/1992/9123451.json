 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social concerns with the consequences of climatic change require                evidence of its effects on ecological systems on land and at sea.               In both habitats humans intervene, e.g., deforestation, pollution               of lakes, and marine harvesting.  In addition, \"natural\"                        fluctuations driven by internal ecological processes also occur.                Therefore, there is a definite need to monitor the long-term                    variability of populations, communities and ecosystem, and                      especially to understand the underlying processes so as to                      separate the different causal factors.                                                                                                                          Marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecologists are actively                      engaged in analysis and planning of long-term data sets.                        However, ecological interpretations of these data sets differ in                detail, even though researchers have common questions about                     ecological concepts.  Dr. Steele will hold a month-long summer                  school in 1992 at Cornell University that will bring together                   practitioners for the different disciplines to exchange                         information about data sets, methods of analysis and theoretical                explanations.  The steering committee will invite 15-20 students                at the graduate or post-doctoral levels, and approximately 10                   lecturers.  This workshop follows a successful 1991 summer school               at Cornell University.",
