Quinn Brewster, Department of Mechanical and                       Industrial Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-                       Champaign, to Japan for a cooperative research project with                     Professor Yukio Yamada at the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory                 (MEL), Agency for Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of                International Trade and Industry.  The research will include a                  study of the picosecond time-resolved spectroscopy of laser                     plumes.  A major problem associated with laser material                         processing is achieving efficient coupling of laser energy into                 the workplace.  This coupling is governed by complicated, non-                  linear mechanisms at the target and above the target surface in a               plume/plasma/shock wave generated by laser-material interaction.                Various studies have shown sharp decreases in the transmissivity                and/or thermal coupling coefficients associated with plume                      formation.  Characteristics of the plume are largely unknown, but               are known to depend upon incident laser flux level.  This                       research addresses the difficult problem of shedding more light                 on the structure of, and heat transfer mechanisms in, the plume                 formed above Al targets when irradiated by high power lasers.                   This research supports a companion NSF-sponsored study which has                as a primary objective the development of techniques which can be               used to determine the relative importance of plume absorption,                  scattering, and emission on coupling of laser energy into metal                 targets.                                                                                                                                                        Results of the research have the potential of optimizing and                    expanding the use of lasers in materials processing.  The                       facilities at MEL are state-of-the-art and include high power                   processing lasers, rapid scan spectrometers, and picosecond,                    pulsed dye lasers and photo-oscilloscopes.  This type of                        equipment is found in only a few laboratories in the world.  The                combination of modern experimental facilities and experience in                 application of picosecond time-resolved spectroscopy on the part                of the Japanese host researcher and experience in high-power                    laser-material interaction on the part of the U.S. principal                    investigator offers a unique opportunity to expand the knowledge-               base of a technology which is of critical importance to U.S.                    industrial competitiveness.",
