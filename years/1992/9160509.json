At present, a variety                                             of material related problems of                                                 existing commercial Pockels cells                                               have limited their use below 300 nm.                                            The researchers at Quantum                                                      Technology Inc. grow their own BB0                                              crystals, and these crystals will be                                            used in the experiments.  It has                                                good transmission down to 190 nm,                                               has a high damage threshold of 4                                                GW/cm2 and can handle average powers                                            up to 100 watts at 1064 nm.                                                                                                                                     A BBO Pockels cell will be designed                                             at 248 nm utilizing the r11 electro-                                            optic coefficient.  The crystal will                                            be oriented such that the field is                                              applied along (100) and the beam                                                will propagate along (001).  The                                                maximum length of BBO crystals                                                  presently available is limited to 10                                            mm.  With a crystal dimension 5 x 5                                             x 10 mm3, the theoretical half-wave                                             voltage is expected to be 14 KV.                                                However, by employing two identical                                             crystals optically in series and                                                electrically in parallel, the half-                                             wave voltage of 14 KV will be                                                   reduced to 7 KV at 248nm.                                                                                                                                       BBO crystals grown at QTI will be                                               used in this work.  A BBO Pockels                                               cell will be assembled and                                                      completely characterized for use at                                             248 nm.",
