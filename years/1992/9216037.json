 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the early stages of a design project, it is especially                  important to be able to represent, at a high level of abstraction,              the functional requirements of the system being designed.  This                 makes it possible for the design team to arrange and rearrange the              essential functional components rapidly.  This also offers a means              to explore the feasibility of different system configurations and               to pose and answer \"what-if\" questions before the design is frozen.             Similarly, if one is able to model processes associated with                    manufacture, then in a like manner, the feasibility of different                manufacturing systems can be explored.  It is well known that                   design for manufacture tools are implementable and useful once the              design of a component is known.  But what if it is necessary to                 address the issue of design for manufacture very early, for                     example, when only the function is known?  At present, this remains             an open question.  If the tools for modeling function and                       manufacturing processes at the function level of abstraction are                developed then it should be possible to pose and answer \"what-if\"               questions that occur at the function-manufacture interface.                          The development of the means to include manufacturing                      considerations in design when only the functional requirements are              known is the focus of this research.",
