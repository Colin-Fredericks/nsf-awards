 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this joint CEDAR/STEP Workshop is to provide             an international forum for an in-depth discussion of plasma                     structuring issues as they pertain to high and middle latitudes.                Much new information has become available on the role played by the             interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in ordering large scale (~ 100              km) plasma density and velocity structuring in the high latitude                region as a result of several CEDAR/STEP multi-technique                        observational campaigns.  Clustering of equipment near the major                incoherent scatter radar (ISR) sites along the 70oW longitude line,             many of them funded by CEDAR, and the EISCAT and MU radars have                 provided extremely valuable and detailed corrdinated data sets;                 hence the need for a forum for the presentation of such                         interdependent measurements.  It is the intent of this Workshop to              organize this new information on such scientific topics as:  high               latitude structured plasma density enhancements known as polar                  \"patch\" and auroral \"blob\" formations, their entry, exit, and small             scale (km to tens of m) structuring, as well as their dynamics and              conjugacy; observations of sun-aligned polar cap and auroral arcs,              their morphology, plasma and neutral dynamics, and their small-                 scale structuring in sheared flow regions.  The modeling of these               featutres, using theoretical and empirical methods for a better                 understanding of the physical parameters controlling their                      occurrence, will also be a major topic of deliberation.  In                     addition, results from a recent conjugate mid-latitude campaign                 will be discussed to determine the factors controlling structuring              in this region, their inverse correlation with sunspot cycle and                relationship to gravity wave activity.  It is hoped that several                joint publications in the open literature will result from this                 Workship, as well as firm plans for any other international joint               initiative necessary to cover gaps in our knowledge of specific                 plasma structuring issues.",
