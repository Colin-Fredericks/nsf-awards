 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to help with the preparation of three of the             projected five volumes of the New Flora of Chile and a database of              Chilean plants.  This is a cooperative project among the University             of Concepcion, Chile, the Missouri Botanical Garden, The Ohio State             University, the University of Reading, England, and the University              of Munich.  More the 50 international specialists in various plant              groups are already participating in this project.  The finished                 work will be the first complete modern Flora for any country in                 South America, and will stimulate both basic and applied research               in Chile and other parts of South America, as well as serving as an             important reference for ongoing work in other countries.  This                  Flora will also allow informed management of Chile's natural                    resources, and with the database will serve as test model for                   preparation of other country-wide Floras.                                            About 49% of the native flora of Chile is endemic to that                  country, a high proportion more typical of oceanic islands than                 continental areas.  This highly unusual native flora is not will                known, but at the same time is under severe pressure from habitat               destruction in response to economic pressures, particularly export              logging and agriculture.  Study and management of the cooperation               is necessary to allow Chile to complete an inventory of its flora               in the time available.",
