 "awd_abstract_narration": "The photochemical and photophysical consequences of attaching                   reactive chromophores to the hydrohpobic tail of amphiphilic                    molecules will be investigated. The thrust of the program will                  be to define the structural features of the microheterogeneous                  systems which dictate the resultant reaction processes. The                     reactive groups to be investigated include styryl and stilbene                  moieties. Bifunctional phospholipids will be utilized in order                  to provide molecular species which have spatially exact                         geometries. These geometries place reactive functional groups                   in favorable positions for reactions such as cycloadditions.                    Interactions between reactive groups such as stilbenes,                         styrenes, and polyenes will be studied in dilute, mixed, and                    pure dispersions in an attempt to separate intermolecular and                   intramolecular processes.                                                       %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor David Whitten at the University of                 Rochester. The studies will be directed to establishing a                       better understanding of the factors which control chemical                      reactions in heterogeneous systems. The systems to be                           investigated are unique molecules which have both hydrophilic                   (attracted to water) and hydrophobic (repelled by water)                        properties. By incorporating reactive chemical groups that are                  responsive to light as an integral part of these molecules, it                  is possible to produce a variety of reactions which might                       otherwise fail to occur. Implications for the medical and                       materials areas of science are numerous.",
