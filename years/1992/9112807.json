 "awd_abstract_narration": "Georgia Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the American               Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA) and Zoo                   Atlanta, will host a three-day conference to examine the impacts                on zoo policies of changing moral views regarding treatment of                  animals.  Their expanding agenda in conservation is viewed as one               aspect of the changing role of zoos and aquariums in response to                broader moral challenges by animal welfare groups, animal                       liberation advocates, and radical environmentalists.  In                        particular, the conference will consider ethical issues in policies             concerning the development and implementation of Species Survival               Plans, intended to provide buffers against extinction through                   captive breeding programs and the careful management of genetic                 resources.  The proposed conference will assemble zoo                           professionals, professional ethicists, and conservation biologists              to discuss the difficult ethical issues -- regarding capture of                 members of endangered species or the fate of zoo animals who have               already contributed to their species' gene pool, for example --                 that arise in the administration of these plans.  The conference                will result in a position paper to be submitted to the AAZPA Board              of Directors for discussion and adoption and the conference                     presentations will be edited for publication in book form.                                                                                                      This project allows a highly qualified and diversified group of                 researchers, zoo administrators, and moral advocates for animals                to address theoretical and practical issues in the development of               ethical policies and practices for the treatement of animals. The               principal investigators and conference participants are well                    qualified; institutional support is very good.  Guidelines and a                volume of general interest to the field will result.  The budget                request is reasonable.  Support is recommended.",
