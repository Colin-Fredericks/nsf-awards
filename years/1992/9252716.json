 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Joint Policy Board for Mathematics, representing the                   American Mathematical Society, the Mathematical Association of                  America, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics is              conducting a study of the recognition and rewards system in the                 mathematical sciences.  Numerous recent reports point to this                   system as a key to reforming the K through 12 education system, to              revitalizing undergraduate science and mathematics education, and               to elevating the level of technology transfer in order to boost                 economic competitiveness.  The study also responds to the                       increasing awareness of the importance of interdisciplinary work                and of the participation of mathematical scientists in the                      education of individuals who plan to work in industry and                       government.  This initial study will focus on the barriers to                   changing the rewards structure and will be implemented as a series              of case studies.  The results of this research will be reported to              NSF and to the mathematics community through the news publications              of the three organizations that comprise the JPBM.  This research               is expected to be the basis of further study of the system that                 will lead to a set of recommendations and plan of action to produce             a recognition and rewards system that is consistent with the                    missions of institutions of higher education and with the diverse               responsibilities of college and university faculty.//",
