 "awd_abstract_narration": "The complex interplay between economic and political                       conditions and the nature and amount of informal economic                       activity, such as streetvending, has received little attention.                 This doctoral dissertation will examine the relationships between               policies toward street vending, and degrees of economic                         stability, political stability, and the level of organization for               political action among the streetvendors themselves.  In                        particular, it will examine the nature of the conflict between                  streetvendors, city officials, and economic interest groups                     opposed to the presence of street trading in Mexico City, during                two time periods, one of stringent regulation and one of an                     uneasy truce.  Archival sources, newspaper reports, interviews                  with current and previous officials and streetvendor leaders,                   interviews with streetvendors, and ethnographic fieldwork in a                  few selected street market areas will be used to illuminate the                 process of the regulation of streetvending in one of the largest,               fastest growing, and most congested cities in the developing                    world.                                                                                                                                                               This project will contribute to social scientific                          understanding of the political and economic factors shaping the                 construction and enforcement of regulatory policy.  This project                also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young                scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.",
