 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study attempts to capitalize on the recent observation                     that very high photoefficiencies can be obtained for the                        semiconductor-catalyzed oxidative mineralization of                             trichloroethylene in the gas phase.  A systematic study of the                  dependence of the photoefficiency on vapor composition, nature                  and deployment of photocatalyst, wavelength and intensity of                    radiation, and temperature is conducted in bench-top fixed-bed                  reactors; the goal is to optimize the photoefficiency and                       obtain information on the chemistry of the system.  The study                   will also be expanded to other compounds, including                             chloroform, methyl chloroform, perchlorethylene, isooctane,                     and toluene.                                                                                                                                                    The phenomenon has great potential as the basis of a cost-                      effective technology, suitable for retrofit, for destroying                     volatile organic pollutants in systems for air or steam                         stripping of polluted water or soil, ventilation of industrial                  or transportation systems, and such highly polluting                            operations as painting and printing.",
