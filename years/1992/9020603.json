 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecological Cognition in Visualization                                             This effort contributes to the theory of a user model and a                   measurement methodology designed, in part, to permit quantitative               assessment of visualization interfaces.  Ecological theory states               that the state of affairs in the world can be represented                       directly through cognitive \"states of affairs\" (corresponding to                ecological processing aspects).  This work is to test the                       hypothesis that ecological processing includes cycles of                        \"envisioning\" and \"inspection\" information processing operations.               The difficulty of cognitive tasks can then be characterized by                  the allocation of processing resources (e.g., the allocation of                 attention) between the (relatively) memory-independent ecological               operations and controlled, memory intensive symbolic processing.                Thus, this approach allows consideration of the task context as                 well as viewing logical cognitive operations.  It makes possible                testable predications about both abstract and concrete tasks.  It               can be  folded into existing GOMS models for quantitative                       assessment of interface metaphors allowing subsequent evaluation                and minimization of the difficulty of interacting with direct                   manipulation and visualization interfaces.",
