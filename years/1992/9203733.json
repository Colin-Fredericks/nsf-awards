 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research project is to develop an approach                  for analyzing the dynamic behavior of general multi-degree-of-                  freedom nonlinear systems possessing multiple internal resonances               under external random excitation. The research will take the form               of combined analytical, numerical and experimental                              investigations. Multiple internal resonances frequently exist in                both continuous and discrete multi-degree-of-freedom systems such               as cable systems, plates, coupled beams, aerospace structures,                  and mechanisms. Systems with multiple internal resonances                       experimentally exhibit dangerous and complex response                           characteristics under harmonic excitation, as observed in the                   laboratory. Under random excitation, we will develop two modes                  for stochastic bifurcation. These modes will be used to examine                 the conditions under which catastrophic behavior can be presented               in terms of system parameters space and excitation spectral                     density level. The analytical approach is based on the method of                stochastic averaging of the response energy envelope, with some                 innovations. The advantage of this approach is that it provides                 useful information pertaining to energy transfer among the                      interacting modes and their stochastic bifurcation in the                       neighborhood of multiple internal resonance conditions. The                     validity of the analytical approach will be verified by Monte                   Carlo numerical simulations and experimental tests of random                    excited nonlinear models. All approaches have the common goal of                improving our understanding of the mechanisms underlying                        dangerous nonlinear phenomena. The results of this research will                lead to new guidelines for engineers involved in the design of                  industrial machine components, cable structures, aircraft                       structures, liquid propellant rockets, and elevated water towers.",
