 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors S.S. Jaswal and D. J.                            Sellmyer of the University of Nebraska to collaborate                           in condensed matter physics with Professor J\u001argen                               Hafner of the Technical University of Vienna.  Their                            two research groups share an interest in metallic                               glasses and propose to work together in a study of                              amorphous and quasicrystalline transition-metal alloys.                         The collaboration will bring together the theoretical                           expertise of the Austrian group in atomic structure of                          liquid and amorphous metals with the experimental and                           theoretical expertise of the U.S. group in the                                  electronic structure and magnetic properties. In                                addition, several other research groups in Europe and                           the U.S. will be brought into the collaboration for                             particular necessary talents.  At least one young U.S.                          scientist, probably on the postdoctoral level, will be                          involved in the collaboration.                                                                                                                                  This project addresses mainstream issues in the field                           of magnetic materials, and focuses on some particular                           active, important and rewarding topics.  The                                    combination of theoretical and experimental work should                         contribute to a better understanding of the short-range                         order and electronic properties of 3d-5d transition                             metal glasses.  The quasicrystals are much more                                 difficult to study theoretically because of their non-                          periodic long-range order.  Still, this effort to                               extend the theory on amorphous systems to the                                   properties of quasicrystals made up of simple metals                            has a good chance of providing valuable new insights.",
