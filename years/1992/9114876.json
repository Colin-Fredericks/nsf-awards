 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research effort is aimed at the further                            understanding of the interaction between the various regions of                 the earth's atmosphere.  One central thrust is to study the                     interaction between atmospheric waves generated in the dense                    lower atmosphere with the plasma in the ionosphere.  These waves.               create considerable structure on the bottom of the ionosphere                   from which many radio and communications systems reflect signals.               The resulting distortion is well known but not so well                          understood.  In addition much fine scale structure results which                cause even higher frequency signals to \"twinkle\" much as                        starlight does due to atmosphere turbulence.  We hope to gain new               insights into just how these waves affect the mid-latitude                      ionosphere on all these scales by conducting an intensive                       campaign in the Puerto Rican sector where the NSF is clustering a               number of state-of-the-art instruments.  We will add to this                    instrumentation by taking our portable radar to the nearby island               of St. Croix for the campaign.  In addition to gravity waves we                 are interested in how lightning may affect the ionosphere and                   plan some joint observations with the Millstone Hill Observatory                to see if short wavelength electrostatic waves can be detected                  preferentially over thunderstorms.  Upward striking lightning has               been detected from the space shuttle and ionosphereic effects                   seem quite likely.  Another topic of interest is the turbulence                 induced in the ionosphere by the flow fields in and around the                  aurora.  This turbulence may be sufficiently intense that the                   present interpretation of incoherent scatter radar data is in                   error.",
