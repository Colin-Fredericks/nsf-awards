 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Keith MacAdam and others of                       his research group at the University of Kentucky to                             collaborate in physics research with Professor E. Horsdal-                      Pedersen of the Institute of Physics, University of Aarhus,                     Denmark. They will investigate the collisions of singly                         charged ions on a target of highly excited Rydberg atoms in                     states of maximum angular momentum, called circular-states.                     Methods for creating these states have recently been                            developed, but there has been virtually no investigation                        yet of their collisional properties.  This proposed ground                      breaking work requires the combination of expertise found                       in the two collaborating groups and the unique facilities                       of the Institute of Physics at Aarhus.  The U.S. group                          contributes substantial expertise in ion-Rydberg atom                           collisions and various analytical techniques.  The Danish                       investigator is a first class researcher in electron                            capture processes and circular state production.  The                           collision measurements will be carried out using lasers and                     low energy ion beams at the Danish Institute, where the                         necessary circular-state collision target is being                              installed in a dedicated scattering apparatus.                                                                                                                  This project will elucidate new phenomena in electron                           capture and angular-momentum changing collisions at                             intermediate velocities.  No collision studies of high                          angular momentum or circular state Rydberg atoms with                           incident ions have ever been done.  The observation of an                       alignment dependence in charge transfer is very new, even                       for the lowest non-isotropic state of a target, and it is                       expected to stimulate new interactions between theory and                       experiment.  The opportunity to bring together the newest                       techniques and researchers uniquely accomplished in the                         required areas for a study of the \"Three Body Problem\" at                       the boundary of quantum and classical mechanics is an                           outstanding opportunity for scientific progress.",
