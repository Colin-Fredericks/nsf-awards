The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a four-month postdoctoral research visit by             Dr. Adam Frank to the University of Leiden to work with Dr.                     Vincent Icke.  The researchers will focus on a class of problems                associated with the formation of astrophysical jets.  Based on a                study of bipolar outflow in Planetary Nebulae, Drs. Frank and Icke              believe that a single mechanism associated with a single geometry               is responsible for the ubiquitous, well collimated flows.  They will            use sophisticated numerical hydrodynamic code to simulate the                   interaction of aspherical stellar outflows and the production of jets.          The goal of this project is to demonstrate the efficacy of this                 process over a wide range of length and time scales beginning with              stars and ending with galaxies.  They will then go further and                  provide \"theoretical observations\" allowing detailed comparisons of             the models with what is seen in the telescope.                                                                                                                  The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a stipend for four months plus a dependent allowance.",
