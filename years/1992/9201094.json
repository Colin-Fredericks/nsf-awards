 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among solid polymer phases, the crystalline inclusion compounds                 (IC) formed between guest polymer chains and small-molecule host                clathrates are unique.  In inclusion compounds guest polymer chains             are confined to narrow channels whose walls are formed by the host              clathrate matrix, and, as a consequence, are isolated from all                  neighboring polymer chains.  The net result is a solid crystalline              phase where polymer chains are well-separated from their neighbors.             This environment affords the opportunity to study isolated, yet                 solid, polymer chains as they conform and move in their IC                      channels, where they are free from the influences of neighboring                polymer chains, which in bulk polymer phases are often highly                   cooperative and complex.  Differential thermal analysis, X-ray,                 Fourier transform infrared, and especially solid-state Nuclear                  magnetic resonance observations of polymers in inclusion compounds              and their comparison to bulk polymer observations should permit an              assessment of the inherent mobilities and conformations of solid                polymers and help us to evaluate the effects of constraining                    environments (narrow channels) on the same.  Ultimately, an attempt             will be made to spin and draw fibers from their inclusion compounds             with the hope that the highly extended and isolated polymer chains              will produce fibers with improved strengths because of their high               extensions and the absence of a chain folded morphology when they               are coalesced.",
