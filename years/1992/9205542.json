 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nistor will continue his work in that part of the theory of                operator algebras relating to noncommutative geometry, and                      particularly index theory and cyclic cohomology.  His immediate                 goals include a formula for the bivariant Chern-Connes character                and the identification of the Atiyah-Singer integrand,                          computation of the cyclic cohomology of foliation algebras using                Bott's simplicial methods, and a combination of these two into an               index theorem for foliations.                                                        The general area of mathematics of this project has its                    basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.                     Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of                   complex numbers.  Special types of operators are often put                      together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.                   These abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications.               For example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn                 is  currently being used to study the structure of DNA, and they                are of fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which                 is becoming increasingly important in physics.",
