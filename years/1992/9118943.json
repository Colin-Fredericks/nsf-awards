 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective is modification and testing of an existing               broadband seismometer for eventual installation in ocean borehole               OSN-1, drilled by the ODP in March of 1991 (Leg 136).  Augmentation             of world-wide seismograph coverage through the addition of ocean                floor seismic observatories will improve earthquake location, and               allow the more accurate determination of deep Earth velocity                    structure.                                                                      %%%                                                                             Understanding why and where earthquakes occur is essential to                   mitigating these natural hazards.  The earth motions induced by                 earthquakes also provide detailed information on deep earth                     structure.  Such information is crucial to understanding such                   phenomena as the Earth's magnetic field, and the distribution of                mineral resources on the Earth's surface.  Our ability to measure               earthquakes, however, is severely limited by geographic constraints             on the placement of seismometers.  Heretofore, the two-thirds of                the Earth's surface that is water-covered has been inaccessible to              seismometer coverage.  Emplacement of borehole seismometers in                  ocean-sub-seafloor observatories is one solution proposed. This                 research is the first step in the creation of a network of ocean                observatories: the modification and land-testing of a bore-hole                 seismometer capable of recording earth motions over a wide band of              frequencies.",
