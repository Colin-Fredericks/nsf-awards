 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plankton ecology has made considerable progress towards                         understanding seasonal species succession in temperate lakes.  The              interaction of predation, competition, and resource quality play a              large role in forming predictable, seasonal, changes in species                 abundance.  However, the potential for genotypes (clones) to                    respond to these same ecological factors within plankton species                has not been well studied.  Previous research documented a strong               pattern of clonal, seasonal, succession in local populations of                 Daphnia pulcaria.  This succession was strongly associated with                 seasonal changes in population migratory behaviors, the densities               of a strong competitor, and the availability of a refuge from                   predation.  The proposed work seeks a mechanistic understanding of              clonal succession in D. pulcaria population. Specifically, it will              address several questions: 1) How consistently repetitious are                  seasonal clonal successions in Daphnia populations?  2) Are there               quantitative genetic differences among clones in ecologically                   relevant traits such as habitat use?  3) How do predation                       (including refuge availability), competition, and resource change               affect seasonal clonal succession?  4) finally, how does the                    frequency of sexual reproduction affect the observed successional               patterns?  The crustaceans under study here are key members of the              food chains of lakes.",
