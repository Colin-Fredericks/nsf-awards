 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for an extension of the research currently                being carried out by the American Mathematics Society on the                    recognition and rewards systems that currently exist in academic                departments in the mathematical sciences.  These studies are seen               as key to revitalizing science and mathematics education at the                 school and undergraduate levels.  This proposal calls for                       ethnographic and other innovative methodologies that will offer                 data on barriers to changing the rewards structures.  The project               will be carried out as a series of case studies and a survey of                 some 3,000 mathematical sciences departments.  The results will be              reported to NSF and to the scientific community through the usual               channels of the member societies of the Joint Policy Board for                  Mathematics.  The project, building upon the work supported by the              current SGER grant, is expected to provide a critical basis for                 subsequent investigations that will lead to recommendations and a               plan of action to produce recognition and rewards systems that are              consistent with missions and responsibilities of institutions of                higher education.",
