Renewed calculus materials developed                 through the NSF supported project at the University of Iowa                     will be revised, tested, and refined at these three                             institutions.  The University of Iowa and the University of                     Wisconsin- La Crosse are planning toward full implementation.                   The project involves extensive training of faculty and teaching                 assistants to use these materials and approaches.  In addition                  to learning traditional calculus skills, students are exposed                   to new ideas through large open ended projects on a variety of                  scientific and mathematical projects.",
