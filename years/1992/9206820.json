 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to design and build a set of                   instruments to measure the electric and magnetic fields while                   deployed in the submarine environment of continental shelves. The               design will permit simultaneous recording of variations in the                  horizontal electric field, the 3-component magnetic field, tilt of              the instrument, and ambient temperature. The instruments will be                developed and built by collaborating groups at the Woods Hole                   Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and the Scripps                      Institution of Oceanography in California. They will subsequently               be used as an essential part of a planned magnetotelluric                       geophysical transect reaching from the continental southeastern                 Appalachians to the deep Atlantic ocean.                                             Electrical conductivity in rocks, which depends on ionic fluid             content, metal or carbon content, and temperature can provide                   information about large scale geological structures that is                     complementary to other geophysical measurements such as seismic or              gravity. Recent experiments have demonstrated that large-scaled                 structures can be imaged with this approach but that a combination              of land and seafloor measurements are essential to proper                       interpretations of continental structures extending seaward.                    Instrumentation for measuring electrical conductivity on land and               in the deep (calm) ocean environments already exist. This project               will result in instrumentation to fill in the gap for measurements              in the shallower waters of the continental shelf areas.",
