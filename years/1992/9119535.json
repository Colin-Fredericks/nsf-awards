 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many organisms early determinative events are established by                 the differential distribution of informational                                  molecules(cytoplasmic determinants).  In Drosophila,the                         distribution of these determinants is established by genes that                 make a strictly maternal contribution to the developing embryo.                 Drosophila serves as a model system for studying genes that                     produce these determinants and/or are involved in properly                      distributing these determinants within the embryo.  The PI is                   studying Mango Nashi a maternal effect gene required both for the               determination of the primordial germ cells and establishment of                 the anteroposterior axis of the embryo.  The mago locus is novel                in that mutations of the locus disrupt germ cell formation and                  are also capable of causing a replacement of anterior embryonic                 structures by posterior tail and abdominal structures.  Double                  mutants between mago and alleles of loci crucial for delineation                of the anteroposterior axis of the embryo will be used to better                define the role of mago in specifying the anteroposterior axis of               the embryo.  Genetic isolation of new mago alleles and                          developmental analysis of thes alleles will provide information                 necessary for refining models dipicting the role of mago+ in                    early embryonic development.  A molecular characterization of the               mago locus will include: (a) identification of mago mRNA(s), and                isolation and sequencing of cDNA clones representative of mago                  mRNA; and (b) determination of the distribution of the mago                     transcript(s) and protein(s) in oocytes and embryos.  This                      combined analysis should significantly improve our understanding                of mago+ function in early Drosophila development.  Thus, these                 studies should provide insights into the mechanisms underlying                  germ cell formation and the establishment of positional                         information in the early embryo.",
