 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding to support the overseas travel costs                of American participants to a two-day symposium which is part of                a larger four-day  meeting at Cambridge University in August,                   1992.  This meeting is jointly sponsored by four scientific                     societies located in Europe,  Canada and the United States and will             be attended by approximately 300 biologists from throughout the                 world.  The symposium is entitled \"Development in Vertebrate                    Embryos:  Comparative physiology, environmental influences and                  parental role.\"  It was organized by Dr. Carol Vleck (University                of Arizona) and Dr. Amos Ar (Tel Aviv University, Israel) and will              be attended by 19 persons from nine countries,  including 11                    American.  The symposium will focus on the special physiological                problems that vertebrate embryos face as they progress from just                a single cell to an independent individual.  These developing forms             do not have the same arsenal of physiological and behavioral                    responses that adults do to maintain function in the face of                    stress,  yet still must be able to cope with conditions to which                they are exposed.  Relatively little attention has been given to                understanding the diversity of physiological strategies available               to embryos and how parents ameliorate the physical environment in               which the embryo develops.  The symposium will bring together for               the first time persons from diverse backgrounds in vertebrate                   physiology. but all with a special interest in embryonic form and               function.",
