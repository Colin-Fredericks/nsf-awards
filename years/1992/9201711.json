 "awd_abstract_narration": "An ideal species to use for examination of the evolution of                     cooperation among unrelated individuals has recently been found -               a social insect that occurs in discrete populations, one of which               contains cooperative and the other non-cooperative, aggressive                  individuals.  The Principal Investigator plans to exploit the                   existence of these two social morphs to perform the first                       experiments directly testing many of the fundamental precepts of a              group-selection hypothesis of the evolution od cooperation.  The                behavioral experiments outlined in this proposal also provide the               first empirical investigation of whether \"group level punishment\"               of cheaters exist.  In addition, the P.I. will attempt a molecular              genetic analysis of cooperative and non-cooperative morphs to                   examine whether one morph is \"invading the other.  Given the                    crucial role social insects have played in the development                      of kin selection theory and its eventual transfer to studies of                 primate and other social systems, insights generated from this                  study testing group selection in the evolution of social insect                 behavior can be expected to be transferable to other social                     systems.",
