 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of hands-on laboratory exercises are being developed                   for a triad of upper-division physics courses based on the                      techniques of active optical spectroscopy of gases and plasmas                  using a tunable dye laser as probing light source.  The                         laboratories give students hands-on experience in operating and                 calibrating a dye laser system and teach various ways in which                  we can use scanning, narrowband dye lasers in the spectroscopic                 study of matter.  Four core exercises are being developed                       initially, with gradual extensions and additional exercises                     being added as independent research projects conducted by                       senior physics majors.  The following form the initial four                     core exercises:  (1) An Introduction to Dye Lasers and                          Calibration;  (2) Investigation of Atomic Structure by Laser                    Optogalvanic Spectroscopy;  (3) Spectroscopic Study of                          Molecular Structure by Laser Induced Fluorescence and by Laser                  Absorption;  and (4) Optical Diagnosis of Electrostatic Waves                   in Plasma.  Emphasis is placed on hands-on student                              participation and the full utilization of current state-of-the-                 art active spectroscopy apparatus and procedures as provided by                 frequency scanning, narrowband dye lasers and supporting                        optical components and instrumentation for signal analysis.",
