 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on a balance between an academic research             program, engineering education, and industrial applications.  In                this program, the general problems of engineering design and design             for manufacturing will be addressed.  In particular, one part of                the research program considers the development of analytical and                experimental models for determining the physical surface-structures             produced from both material removal processes and solid-freeform                fabrication.  The basis for these models is fractal-based                       representations, or more generally the Karhunen-Loeve method, which             will provide indices for linking manufacturing process variables                to design parameters.  While a fractal-based approach is known to               be applicable at surface finish scales, surface structures that                 will be identified in this research are at tolerance scales (e.g.,              40-300 microns for journal bearings).  Tolerances usually carry the             function of the device.  For example, in a rotating mechanism, the              tolerances associated between a shaft and a bearing assembly may                be critical, i.e., if the shaft-bearing assembly is misaligned or               out-of-tolerance, catastrophic failure of the system will result                due to excessive wear and possible seizure.                                          Providing design methods and measures that link manufacturing              process variables to the design parameters, performance parameters,             and functional requirements of a design is crucial, especially if               manufacturing information is to be combined with functional                     considerations in the early stages of design.  This research will               seek to verify the fractal-based models with experimentation,                   represent the results within a formal set-based theory for design,              and apply the method to rotating machinery, structures, and                     microautomation.  Beyond the fundamental theories of fractal                    tolerances and set-based design representations, computational                  methods will be developed for linking global geometric information              to the design for manufacturing techniques.  The general scope for              these computational methods will be a feature-based design system,              including the formal representation of spatial relationships.",
