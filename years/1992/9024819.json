 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent discussions of the roles of experimental evidence in                  science, there have been two opposing positions.  Dr. Franklin,                 along with others, has argued for an \"evidence model\" of science                in which questions concerning theory choice, confirmation,                      refutation, etc. are decided on the basis of valid experimental                 evidence.  Others have argued that science is merely a social                   construction, and that the social and/or cognitive interests of                 the scientific community play the major role, with experimental                 evidence playing at most a minor role.  Dr. Franklin, under this                grant, is investigating further arguments in favor of the \"evidence             model.\"  He believes that by considering the context of pursuit,                the reasons why scientists pursue a particular research program,                rather than the context of justification, one might be able to                  reconcile the two views.                                                                                                                                        This work continues the current trend in history and philosophy of              science of considering the actual practice of science.  On the                  basis of this work as well as work by other philosophers and                    historians, Dr. Franklin hopes to present a more complete                       philosophy of experiment.",
