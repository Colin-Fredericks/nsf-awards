 "awd_abstract_narration": "As electrical power high voltage transmission                                   systems become more heavily loaded due to                                       increased electric loads and larger transfers of                                power between utilities, efficient system operation                             is becoming threatened due to static security,                                  transient stability, and more recently voltage                                  stability constraints.  The objective of the research                           proposed here is to use energy function methods to                              develop a unified measure of power system security.                             To date energy functions techniques have been                                   applied successfully to the transient stability and                             maximum stable loadability problems; however,                                   little work has been done to access dynamic voltage                             stability.  Such a measure of system voltage security                           is essential for economic and reliable operations.                              Research is to be performed in four areas.  The                                 first area will be an investigation of the modeling                             detail required to adequately capture the dynamics                              associated with voltage instability.  More detailed                             models are anticipated for generators, loads,                                   transformers and static var compensators (SVCs).                                Second, research will be done on the development                                of integrated energy function security framework,                               which will require a modified energy function, along                            with a new paradigm to incorporate the varying                                  time scales of the voltage dynamics (from seconds                               to tens of minutes).  Third, the relationship of the                            voltage stability unstable equilibrium points (UEPs)                            with the transient stability UEPs will be                                       investigated; also work on the efficient calculation                            of the UEPs will also be done.  Lastly, integration                             of energy methods into existing control center                                  applications will be explored.",
