 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concerns about ethical abuses in televised political advertising                have grown substantially as a result of developing video                        technology.  This demonstration project is designed to explore                  the development of criteria and coding instruments for                          determining types of ethical abuses in technology for televised                 political ads.  A panel of experts in communication ethics will                 develop criteria for identifying types of abuses.  The criteria                 will be used to develop a coding instrument to be applied to                    political spots and a small pilot project on a small sample of                  actual spots will be conducted, to determine the usefulness and                 workability of the coding instrument.  The demonstration will                   also develop a script for an educational videotape which would                  discuss the problem of political ethics and technology, providing               samples of misleading technological applications and suggesting                 standards of evaluation.  This project marks the beginning of                   scholarly work on a topic of major importance on issues of                      technology and democracy; results are likely to advance scholarly               and public understanding of the effects of media in political                   life.  The investigator and the expert panel are highly                         qualified; the research plan is good; the budget is very                        reasonable; and the proposal is recommended for support with high               priority.",
