 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the functional behavior and VLSI                     realization of a novel, scalable and intelligent wafer-level                    communications network (the Silicon Wafer Area Network or SWAN)                 supporting fine grained communications with predictable network                 traversal times.  The network's \"intelligence\" is chosen to                     adaptively and dynamically establish virtual interconnections with              the functionality of direct point-to-point interconnections for                 passage of individual messages through the network.  The network                is assumed to be a wafer-level function, allowing highly parallel               data links between switches by exploiting the high density of IC                wiring.  The network organization is similar to a systolic                      processing array, using nearest neighbor connections and pipelined              data movement through the network to establish high data rates.                 The critical issue of load balancing is based on (1) achieving                  sufficiently high communications rate capabilities so that network              links are sparsely used (i.e. a rate capability well in excess of               the required data rates) and (2) a global routing and load                      balancing algorithm based on electrostatic and potential energies               (i.e. a network \"activity potential\").  The distributed                         computations of the potential energies provides each local node                 with a slowly varying measure of link usage in regions away from                that node.  The specific research completes VLSI design and circuit             simulations of the performance of the network nodes.  In addition,              the research develops a network simulator to investigate the steady             state and transient behavior of the network with various routing                and load balancing algorithms selected to achieve the maximum VLSI              area/speed performance.",
