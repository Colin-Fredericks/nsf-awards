 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is common to think of using the brightest stars to determine                 extragalactic distances.  Over 50 years ago Hubble first attempted              to resolve stars in other galaxies to quantify the expansion of the             universe, and since then, the use of blue and red supergiants for               extragalactic distance determinations has been explored several                 times.  However, only recently has it been appreciated that young               planetary nebulae also fall into the \"brightest stars\" category and             are therefore potentially useful as distance indicators.  The                   central stars of these objects are almost as luminous as bright red             supergiants, and, as a result, present telescopes and current                   technology allow planetary nebulae to be detected at distances as               large as 25 megaparsecs.                                                                                                                                        Planetary nebulae have several advantages over most other                       extragalactic distance indicators.  Because they are not associated             with any one stellar population they can be found in all types of               galaxies, and are particularly valuable for probing elliptical                  galaxies.  It is elliptical galaxies which define the cores of                  large groups and clusters.                                                                                                                                      In this grant surveys of planetary in elliptical galaxies will be               made out to a distance of 25 megaparsecs.  These measurements will              add to our understanding of the large scale motions of galaxies and             in other studies.
