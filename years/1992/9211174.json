 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on reductions between sets from                           different complexity classes, such as many-one, Turing, truth-                  table, and other, as well as considering  sets from most basic                  complexity classes, including probability classes like R and                    BPP, and sparse sets and tally sets.  When are such reductions                  possible?  When they are, how efficient they can be?  The                       ultimate purpose is to make as many connections as possible                     between different complexity classes, to bring them closer or                   further apart, depending on the cases.                                                                                                                          To be more specific, one research direction is to find what                     consequences can be derived from a given set being reducible                    to a sparse set, or to a tally set.  For example:  Is it                        possible that an NP-complete set is reducible to a sparse set?                  What are the consequences, using various type of reductions.                    Is it possible that all BPP sets are reducible to sparse sets?                  to tally sets?  If it is, that would mean that in some way,                     randomness can be simulated by another type of resources.  Can                  one reduce the problem of building a one-way function to some                   other complexity class?  Can one prove that this reduction                      must be to a very dense set?  How efficiently can one reduce                    on NP-complete set to another one.",
