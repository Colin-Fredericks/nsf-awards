 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study of direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DS/SS)                         techniques for high capacity mobile communications systems is                   proposed. This research aims to develop an understanding of how                 coding  and modulation affect the multiple access capability of                 these systems. In particular, this research will focus on the                   development of combined coding and modulation techniques for                    DS/SS systems. Although coded modulation techniques have                        yielded dramatic performance improvements  when applied to                      communications over narrowband channels, attempts to apply these                techniques to  spread-spectrum systems have thus far produced                   modest results  Rather than attempt to develop entire new classes               of codes, this investigation will examine  existing classes of                  convolutional codes. When the choice of convolutional code is                   combined with the  choice of spreading sequence, a combined                     coding and modulation technique results. It is conjectured  that                the resulting codes will perform as well as any possible coded                  modulation technique for a DS/SS  system.  The objectives of this               research are to understand the fundamental performance limits of                coded modulation techniques for DS/SS systems, to identify                      promising coded modulation techniques,  and to analyze the                      performance of these techniques using a channel model which                     incorporates the  effects of multiple access interference and                   frequency selective fading. The research proposed here  will have               a twofold impact. While understanding the relationship between                  coding and modulation  in a DS/SS system is of long term                        theoretical interest, the development of practical error                        correction techniques for DS/SS is of immediate practical value                 to the mobile communications community.",
