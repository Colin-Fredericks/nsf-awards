 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the                   University of Arizona will purchase an HP 3566A PC Spectrum                     Analyzer which will be dedicated to support research in                         engineering. The equipment will be used for several research                    projects, including in particular the development of a real time                active chatter controller. It is proposed to develop both                       analytically and in hardware the necessary techniques for the                   real time control of machine tool chatter and to implement this                 system in a manner that allows for integration into existing CNC                machine tools. To accomplish this objective, research will focus                on development of techniques for real time identification of the                transfer function between the cutting tool and the workpiece for                a variety of metal working machines as the machine tool operates                in the fully developed chatter regime. Development of an adaptive               closed-loop control strategy (based on the data provided by the                 real time system identification technique) for minimizing the                   motion between the cutting tool and the workpiece. Initial                      research will focus on lathe chatter with the extension to a more               broad class of machine tools, including (but not limited to)                    milling machines and surface grinders, in the future.***    //",
