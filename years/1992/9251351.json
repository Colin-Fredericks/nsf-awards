 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to improve and upgrade the optics laboratory                    experiences for physics students at St. Mary's University by                    enabling our students to measure intensity and polarization in                  addition to the geometrical properties of light, work with                      lasers and interferometers and perform some two-dimensional                     image processing.  Hands-on experience with modern equipment at                 the college level is particularly important for our students,                   a predominant percentage of whom are minority Hispanics who                     come from high schools having limited physics courses with                      poorly equipped laboratories.  Optics has been chosen for                       improvement at this time because other parts of the physics                     laboratory curriculum have received some update and improvement                 during the past several years.  The equipment purchased                         includes eight optics systems, each with laser and                              interferometer, provide the means to study traditional                          properties of light.  A microwave set has been obtained to                      demonstrate optical phenomenon with three cm waves.  The 386 SX                 computers equip our students to explore automatic data                          collection and online data analysis as well as to perform image                 processing.  The instruments acquired allow these students to                   perform experiments at a level that increases their interest in                 physical science and encourages participation in science beyond                 the introductory level.",
