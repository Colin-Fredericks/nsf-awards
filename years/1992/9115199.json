 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI has been using the NCAR community climate model                     version one (CCM1) coupled with a mixed layer ocean to study the                climatic effects of CO2 and other trace gases (OTGs) CH4, N2O,                  CFC13 and CF2C12.  His experiments suggest that OTGs provide an                 important heating source to the earth-atmospheric climate system.               Because the radiative-forcing behavior of CO2 is very different                 from the OTGs, the PI's model simulations show that different                   radiative forcing can lead to quite different climatic effects.                 This research program will continue the study with emphasis on                  the climatic feedback.  Three tasks are proposed.  First a                      detailed diagnosis of CCM1 simulations with focus on climate                    feedback.  Second, use of the CCM2 to study the climatic effects                of C02 and OTGs.  CCM2 includes major improvements in physical                  and dynamical parameterization and is much more realistic for                   climate studies.  Therefore, comparisons of the climatic effects                due to atmospheric trace gases between CCM1 and CCM2 offer a                    unique opportunity to study their sensitivity to model                          formulations.  The third task is to evaluate the feedback effect                of cloud optical properties, which has been identified                          potentially to be a strong negative feedback mechanism during                   climate changes.  This research is important because it seeks to                increase understanding of how trace gases influence climate.",
