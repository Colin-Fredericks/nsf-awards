 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nervous system contains a stereotyped complement of neurons                 with different properties.  Neurons have different shapes, respond              to and release different biochemical messengers, and exert their                effects on unique subsets of target neurons.  The processes                     underlying the development of this neuronal specificity will be                 investigated in the simple nervous system of the grasshopper.  The              investigator has previously characterized a group of 100 midline                neurons that arise from a single identified precursor stem cell.                This group of neurons contains three basic cell types that function             in different sets of behaviors. It will be determined how the final             complement of neurons in the group arises temporally during                     development, over what time course neurons are added to the                     population and when and to what extent cell death reduces the                   population to its final size.  In addition, the birthdays of                    identified neurons, i.e. the timing of a neuron's final cell                    division, will be correlated with cell lineage to test the                      hypothesis that birth order and cell type are related, with                     sequential switches occurring during development to produce                     efferent neurons, local interneurons, and then intersegmental                   interneurons.  Differential staining of cell types and birthdating              of individual neurons by labeling DNA during cell divisions will be             applied.  The system is unique in the high degree of resolution for             identifying individual neurons of a population and the potential                for spanning several levels of inquiry in studying the                          relationships between developmental events and the functioning of               mature neuronal circuits.  The study of neurogenesis in this simple             nervous system that is easily accessible to experimental                        manipulation promises to increase our general knowledge of                      processes involved in the formation of different kinds on neurons.",
