 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbial populations at deep-sea hydrothermal vents link the                   transfer of geothermal energy to the production of organic carbon,              known as chemosynthesis.  As the particulate organic food source                for the filter-feeding and grazing vents animals, free-living                   bacteria function as the chemosynthetic base of the food chain for              this part of the vent communities.  During the continuation of the              RIDGE Initiative, this project will focus on those bacteria from                hydrothermal vents.  Dr. Jannasch will address the question - which             chemosynthetic bacteria are quantitatively the most important in                terms of productivity at hydrothermal vents?  To answer this                    question, newly-developed techniques will be used to assess aerobic             and anaerobic chemosynthetic bacteria at a large variety of vent                environments.  Rates of growth and chemosynthesis will be measured              by a variety of in situ and laboratory experiments.  It's assumed               that these natural microbial populations are highly responsive to               environmental conditions and, therefore, representative of temporal             geophysical-geochemical changes of vent systems.  Work at the Mid-              Atlantic Ridge vent sites will deal with new approaches for in situ             rate measurements of chemosynthetic activity by microbial                       populations covering the polymetal sulfide deposits.  In addition,              work is also planned for the Guaymas Basin Beggiatoa mats.  These               studies will involve the use of two submersibles, the ALVIN and                 JASON/MEDEA.//",
