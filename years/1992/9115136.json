 "awd_abstract_narration": "The driving of stellar winds from the radiation pressure of hot                 stars was suggested early in the century, and has since been found              to provide a good explanation of mass loss in a wide variety of                 astronomical objects, ranging from very hot (\"O-type\") stars, to                active galactic nuclei, to quasars.  In past NSF supported work the             Principal Investigator (PI) has demonstrated fundamental flaws in               earlier concepts of radiatively driven winds.  For example, it is               now clear that scattering of photons in dense winds inhibits the                growth of self-induced instabilities so that the winds only develop             mild inhomogeneities.  However, such instabilities have been                    observed in both optical and ultraviolet spectral lines and are                 thought to indicate the presence of colliding winds moving at                   different speeds.  The shocks generated by these collisions may be              the primary source of x-rays in objects with radiatively driven                 winds.  With this three-year award the PI and a postdoctoral fellow             will develop numerical simulations with more realistic atmospheric              models and to extend earlier analytical solutions to two and even               three dimensions. This work will assess the role of turbulent                   instabilities in the evolution of inhomogeneities through the wind              flow. It is expected that this work will ultimately have a wide                 application to extragalactic objects in addition to O stars.",
