 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Ben Nelson will                    continue his archaeological research at the site of La Quemada                  which is located in Northern Mexico. He will also expand his                    investigation to the neighboring smaller satellite community of                 Pilarillos. Work to date has indicated that La Quemada served as a              major prehistoric center and was occupied at approximately 600-750              AD. It includes ceremonial ball courts, a temple and other major                structures. Over the course of two field seasons Dr. Nelson and his             collaborators will conduct a series of excavations. They will                   continue to expose the ceremonial structure. In addition they will              sink a number of test units in middens which are rich in ceramic                and other cultural remains. Finally test units will also be opened              in areas between terraces where no evidence of structures is                    visible on the surface. The purpose of these is to test the                     proposition that \"low status\" structures built of perishable                    materials were interspersed among the more elaborate buildings. At              the site of Pilarillos surface materials will be collected and a                map made. On this basis areas will then be selected for excavation.             With these data several questions will be addressed: What is the                macroregional and regional chronology? What was the social                      organization and what role was played by La Quemada which is the                largest site? What was the subsistence basis for this prehistoric               group and how did they adapt to and in turn affect their                        environment?                                                                                                                                                    Years of research have given archaeologists considerable knowledge              about prehistoric Central Mexican cultures and of Mayan regions                 further to the South. Likewise much work has been done in the                   American Southwest where large sites such as those at Chaco Canyon              have been extensively excavated. However relatively little is known             about the intervening northern Mexico area. Without this data it is             difficult to examine the intriguing question of interaction and the             extent to which Southwestern cultures were influenced by or served              as outliers of their southern contemporaries. Dr. Nelson's work                 will provide a framework for the northern Mexico region and show                whether it acted as barrier or conduit.                                                                                                                         The research is important for several reasons. It will provide data             of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our                        understanding of how complex societies and inter regional networks              develop and the extent to which Southwestern U.S. prehistoric                   societies developed autonomously.",
