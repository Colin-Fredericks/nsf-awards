 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent explosive growth in parallel and distributed                         systems has brought new importance to the field of scheduling                   theory.  In order for this technology to fulfill its potential                  of providing tremendous computing power, it is crucial to                       understand how to best schedule the components of a                             computation on the resources of the parallel or distributed                     system, so that the most efficient use possible of these                        resources is achieved.  In this research algorithms will be                     designed for the basic problems of scheduling a set of                          machines.  Although this work is motivated by the application                   of these problems to parallel and distributed computing, many                   of the problems are of great importance in operations research                  as well.                                                                                                                                                        The focus is on two fundamental models of scheduling more than                  one machine:  the shop model, in which each job has a number                    of operations, each of which must be processed by a particular                  machine, and the parallel machine model, in which each job has                  one operation which can be processed by any of the machines.                    Most of these problems are NP-hard, and much remains to be                      understood about how well they can be approximated in                           polynomial time.                                                                                                                                                Further, work will be done on scheduling models that more                       completely capture realistic parallel and distributed                           scheduling questions.  Traditional models have largely ignored                  any underlying parallel and distributed network; they have                      also most often assumed that the entire specification of a                      problem is given in advance of the beginning of the                             construction of a schedule.  Problems of scheduling and load                    balancing on specific networks and architectures and on-line                    algorithms for both the traditional and more realistic                          scheduling models will be studied.",
