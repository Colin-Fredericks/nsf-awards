 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enhancing research productivity is critical for many U.S.                       corporations as product life cycles continue to shorten and                     global competition intensifies.  This study begins an empirical                 examination of research units' values concerning justice and the                development of new technologies.  The hypothesis is that                        employment relationships with the primary purpose of innovation                 involve high transaction costs, because of the negotiating,                     monitoring, and enforcements needed to allow exchanges between                  parties to occur.  Shared values, specifically those concerning                 justice, are critical in governing these relationships between                  researchers and employers.  This project will consist of indepth                field interviews of research and management personnel in eight                  biotechnology firms.  Interviews will be directed at exploring                  the respondents' perceptions of justice and of productivity in                  their research groups.  The investigators will publish their                    results in relevant journals, and develop plans for further                     research in this new and important area.  Results from this work                have both theoretical and practical interest.  The investigators                are well qualified; the research plan is good; the budget is very               reasonable; and the proposal is recommended for support with high               priority.",
