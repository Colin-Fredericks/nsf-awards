 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is to thoroughly describe the            main neuroanatomical characteristics of the brain of the Florida                manatee in order to understand how this endangered species                      experiences its environment and why it behaves as it does.  The                 manatee's habitat is being degraded at an alarming rate, and it may             become extinct within the next 2 decades.  This aquatic herbivore               belongs to a unique Order of mammals (Sirenia) and is closely                   related to elephants and hyraxes.  Its brain is relatively small,               unlike those of porpoises and seals; externally, the manatee brain              appears to be relatively simple in appearance in keeping with is its            behavior. However, research from this laboratory has shown different            parts of the manatee brain are quite elaborately organized,                     suggesting a high degree of complexity.  Some brain areas are common            to all mammals, while others are unique to the manatee.                                                                                                         Ongoing research involves the completion of analysis of the manatee             brain and the publication of two major manuscripts to describe and              portray all of the important external and internal features of the              entire manatee brain.  Comparison of the manatee brain with those of            several other mammals will provide clues about the anatomical basis             of the manatee's unusual sensorimotor activities, as well as the                evolutionary relationships of the manatee with other mammalian                  species.",
