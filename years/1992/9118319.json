 "awd_abstract_narration": "The record the chemical and isotopic composition of seawater                    through time contains a wealth of information about climate,                    tectonics, hydrothermal activity on the sea floor, and perhaps even             about the details of sea level change, ocean circulation and                    atmospheric composition.  The problem is to unravel the various                 signals recorded in sediments in terms of these processes.  Here                we will examine the time period spanning the Permian and early                  Triassic, a time of global environmental change.  Our study will                concentrate on the SR and Nd isotopic record, but will also include             various other, probably related, geochemical indicators.  Through               collaborators, we have acquired a suite of samples for this work                from geographically widespread, stratigraphically controlled,                   overlapping sections.  Much of our work will be done on conodonts,              which provide stratigraphic information as well as having                       conveniently high concentrations of most of the elements of                     interest, so that analyses can be made on single individuals or                 fragments in most cases.  We will carefully investigate possible                diagenetic effects, and attempt to delineate much more precisely                than has been done previously the timing and magnitude of the                   observed large changes in Sr and Nd isotopic ratios in seawater                 during this time period.  The data will be examined in terms of                 current knowledge of paleotectonics, paleoclimate and                           paleogeography.  In addition, we will explore the feasibility of                U-Th dating of conodonts in this time interval, in order to refine              the temporal framework for our isotopic studies and to aid in                   section-to-section correlation.",
