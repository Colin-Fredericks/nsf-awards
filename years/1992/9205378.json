 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"solvent like\" characteristics of alumina under a variety                   of conditions will be determined. Diagnostic Diels-Alder                        reactions will be evaluated with emphasis on the stereochemical                 and rate consequences of carrying out reactions on activated                    alumina. In addition to the investigation of cycloaddition                      processes, the ability of alumina surfaces to enhance the                       acidity of hydrogen halides will be evaluated by the                            spectroscopic analysis of protonated polycyclic aromatics. By                   comparison of the behaviour of the cycloaddition and                            protonation reactions on alumina with similar reactions in                      solution, solvent parameters will be assigned to the surface of                 alumina as a function of the activation temperature.                            %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                  of Professors R. A. Pagni and G. W. Kabalka at the University                   of Tennessee. Alumina, a form of aluminum oxide, is a porous                    solid which is widely used in the chemical industry, both as a                  medium for chromatographic separations as well as a catalyst to                 accelerate chemical processes. The studies will be directed to                  providing a framework for defining the parameters which will                    enhance the utilization of alumina as an effective catalyst for                 organic reactions, many of which have important industrial                      applications. By determination of the solvent-like nature of                    alumina, it is possible to learn how the properties of the                      surface can be altered to maximize the yield of well defined                    chemical structures. This work will provide the understanding                   required to efficiently make chemical structures with specific                  architecture or \"stereochemistry.\"",
