 "awd_abstract_narration": "I seek funding to explore the impact of variation in population                 density on the dispersal distance of fertilizing sperm (those                   sperm that successfully fertilize an egg, as opposed to all of                  the sperm that are released) and the incidence of multiple                      paternity in a colonial ascidian.  Work to date has demonstrated                that:                                                                                1) Sperm concentration in the field decreases rapidly with                      distance from isolated males.                                                                                                                                   2) The fertilization rate of eggs is a function of sperm                        concentration.                                                                                                                                             These preliminary data suggest that the dispersal distance of                   fertilizing sperm when multiple males are contributing to                       fertilization will be much shorter than the distances previously                reported for isolated males.  If the probability of a given male                fertilizing an egg is proportional to the concentration of his                  sperm relative to that of other males, then the dispersal                       distance of fertilizing sperm will decrease as population density               increases.  As a consequence, more males may participate in the                 fertilization of each female at higher population densities,                    leading to an increase in multiple paternity within a brood of                  larvae.  I propose to test these hypotheses by establishing                     populations of ascidians with known genetic markers at different                densities and conducting paternity analyses to assay the                        paternity of brooded larvae after fertilization has occurred.                   This study will contribute to our knowledge of benthic marine                   organisms by examining the potential for variation in population                density to impact aspects of population structure such as                       interbreeding population size, levels of inbreeding, relatedness                of neighboring individuals or colonies, and gene flow among sub-                populations.",
