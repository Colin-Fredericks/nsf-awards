The investigator aims to explain the correlation of the semantic                phenomenon of specificity with case morphology and word order.                  Specificity is the semantic property of reference to a particular               individual, as in \"a certain policeman\" or \"one particular                      student\".  The beginning hypothesis is that specific and                        nonspecific noun phrases (NPs) do not have the same syntax, and                 that both the determiner and the noun of a nonspecific NP are                   either incorporated into the verb or reanalyzed with the verb.                  As a corollary, only specific NPs occur in argument positions.                                                                                                  The research will be organized into three phases:  1) study of                  Turkish, a language which exhibits interesting surface                          correlations between the semantics and the morpho-syntax of NPs;                2) study of English, a language significantly different from                    Turkish in terms of surface case morphology and word order; and                 3) a typological study to investigate the cross-linguistic                      behavior of specifics and nonspecifics.  In each phase, support                 for the incorporation/reanalysis hypothesis will be sought from                 morphological and syntactic evidence, including i) case                         morphology, ii) word order and iii) argument structure and                      argument projection strategies.  The rare phenomenon of                         nonspecific subjects of unergative and transitive verbs,                        observable in Turkish, will be investigated in relation to the                  incorporation of subject nouns, which once again is rare and                    observable in Turkish.",
