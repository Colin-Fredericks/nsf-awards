The objective of the                 study is to determine the effect of such hydrogen bonds on the                  redox potential of the iron thiolate complexes.  The results                    are expected to provide significant insight into the way in                     which the redox potentials are controlled in the biological                     molecules.  Characterization of the thiolate complexes will                     involve electrochemistry (cyclic voltammetry), infrared and                     Raman scattering spectroscopies, and x-ray crystallography.                     %%%                                                                             Proteins that contain iron-sulfur clusters are involved in a                    variety of electron transfer processes that occur in biological                 systems.  The precise driving force (redox potential) for these                 clusters varies in subtle ways that are not yet understood.  It                 has been hypothesized that hydrogen bonding to other portions                   of the protein is responsible for \"tuning\" of the redox                         potential.  The objective of this research is to design and                     synthesize models for the iron-sulfur clusters that will allow                  for a systematic test of this hypothesis.",
