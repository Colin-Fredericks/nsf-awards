 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at computer-aided automation of design              and manufacturing processes with particular emphasis on products                modeled with parametric sculptured surfaces.  Over the next five                years, research will proceed concurrently in two primary thrusts:               (1) investigation of novel techniques for conceptual design of                  sculptured surface models, and (2) the development of methods to                facilitate the manufacturing processes associated with such                     products.  The recently developed surface synthesis technique will              be expanded by investigating the development of functional design               constraints based on objective performance measures such as                     aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, or kinematics, as well as on                       subjective characteristics such as surface aesthetics.  Research                in the second category will focus on automated generation and                   verification of numerically controlled (NC) machine programs.                   Given a geometric model of the part to be produced and the                      kinematic capabilities of a candidate machine tool, techniques                  based on spherical geometry will be investigated to determine                   workpiece orientations which are optimal with respect to process                time and dimensional accuracy.                                                       Sculptured surface models are among the most commonly utilized             geometric representations, and their creation, modification and                 fabrication can incur substantial capital investment.  Thus this                research may have a profound effect on product development                      efficiency for a wide range of industrial and consumer products.",
