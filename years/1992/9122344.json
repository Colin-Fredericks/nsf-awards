 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant continues NSF support of a project to integrate                      methods of chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics now used in the                  natural and physical sciences with econometrics.  The project                   does this in a way that develops useful new tools for                           macroeconomics and finance.  The strategy for building tools is                 to stay close to the realities of actual data, actual econometric               practice, and the specific economic applications-- giving up                    abstract generality in the process.                                                                                                                             The major part of this grant is concerned with continuing the                   development of a methodology for determining the structure of                   heterogeneous agent asset pricing models.  This methodology would               be used to test for the relative significance of psychological                  noise trading versus information-based behavior in financial                    markets.  More specifically, the project finds sufficient                       conditions so that a combination of the \"cross-sectional\" ergodic               theorem and/or the central limit theorem for weakly dependent                   processes coupled with \"smart money\" traders playing the noise                  traders does not wipe out the effect of noise traders in                        equilibrium.  The purpose of this line of research is to develop                a rigorous theoretical explanation of abrupt changes in financial               markets such as stock market crashes.  In order to empirically                  test this theory, the GARCH/EGARCH class of estimators are                      modified in order to improve consistency with financial data as                 measured by trading profits tests including both fundamental and                technical strategies.  The information set is enlarged to include               volume, dividend/earnings, interest rates, psychological and                    sociological variables.  The project also completes work begun                  under the previous NSF grant on the development of general tests                for nonlinearity and the comparison of the size and power                       characteristics of these tests with other nonlinearity tests.                   Special attention is paid to moment condition requirements and                  the goal of a test for chaos where size equals power.",
