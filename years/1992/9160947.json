 "awd_abstract_narration": "All-optical switching devices are crucial to realize optical                    computers which offer ultra-fast information processing.  To                    date, many switching concepts have been investigated, but most                  suffer from speed, efficiency, reliability, size and cost                       limitations.  Optivision, Inc. proposes to design, fabricate and                evaluate a novel all-optical switching device based on nonlinear                bimodal fiber-optic interferometry using LP01-LP02 modes.  A                    bimodal polymer fiber (BPF) is spliced through two bi-tapers                    between two single mode fibers (SMFs).  The field access for high               sensitivity to the polymer refractive index is the particular bi-               tapers to be exploited.  This results in a coupling-beating-                    coupling structure in the SMF/BPF/SMF arrangement with the                      beating of LP01-LP02 modes optically controlled by a Kerr-like                  nonlinear polymer.  The Kerr-induced nonlinear differential phase               shift in the BPF controls the optical coupling at the BPF/SMF                   interface. The fabricated switch will be configured as a building               block for logic gate operations.  Using fiber-optic amplifiers,                 these all-fiber logic gates can be cascaded and have large fan-                 out.  In addition, they will be fast, compact, with low power                   consumption and low cost, and are compatible with the fiber optic               networks of the future advanced photonic communication and                      computer designs to satisfy expected heavy demand on the                        information handling capacity.",
