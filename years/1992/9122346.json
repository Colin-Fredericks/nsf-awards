 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional economic wisdom holds that demand surges during                     business cycle booms generate inflation.  Demand rises more quickly             than capacity during booms; in turn, this excess demand produces                \"tight\" labor and product markets and therefore rising wages and                prices.  While this wisdom is widely accepted by economists, the                press and policymakers, its empirical foundations are questionable,             as many recent studies show that rates of wage and price inflation              are uncorrelated or even negatively correlated with the business                cycle.                                                                                                                                                          It is the investigator's opinion that these recent studies fail to              address the question of whether demand surges generate wage and                 price inflation.  The correlation between inflation and the                     business cycle reflects the influence of both supply and demand                 factors.  Adverse supply shocks, such as the oil price increases                of 1973 and 1979, cause prices to rise and output to fall; such                 shocks can cause prices to appear negatively correlated with the                business cycle even if demand shocks generate wage-price inflation.             Studies examining only the correlation between inflation and the                business cycle are thus not useful to policymakers attempting to                determine the potential inflationary effects of fiscal or monetary              policies designed to stimulate short-run output growth.                                                                                                         This research will implement a new methodology for addressing the               relationship between demand shocks and wage-price inflation.                    Information from input-output tables published by the Bureau of                 Labor Statistics will be used to identify the actual sources of                 demand for disaggregated industries.  This information makes the                estimation of the responses of industry wages and prices to                     observable industry demand shocks possible.  For instance, if                   input-output tables indicate that most lumber is used for                       construction purposes, the response of lumber wages and prices to               movements in construction industry output will be investigated.                 By examining the relationship between price and industry demand,                rather than the mere correlation between price and industry output,             the influence of supply shocks on industry activity will be                     effectively controlled.  These results will therefore be more                   useful than existing research for examining the potential                       inflationary impact of fiscal and monetary policies designed to                 stimulate aggregate demand.",
