 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on the development of a design                     environment to rapidly design and produce toys.  This environment               aims to help the domestic toy industry gain competitiveness by                  speedily designing and producing new toys to meet changing market               demands.  The project will first outline an information system                  for model kits and their plastic injection molds with regard to                 the design, fabrication, storage, and setup of molds to improve                 the efficiency of the model kits' design and production.  A                     method for quick mold, for improving the model design, and for                  making new molds by redesigning existing ones through structural                information query will be investigated.                                              The system is expected to capture the design knowledge of                  existing model kits and their molds, to reduce the cost and                     planning time required for a new design, and to reduce overall                  setup time for mold production.",
