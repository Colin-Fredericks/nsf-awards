The project                                aims to examine fundamental questions of surface                                science, including how and why atoms rearrange                                  themselves and how such movements can be induced.                                                                                                               The researchers will (1) determine the geometric                                structure of surfaces, especially reconstructed                                 ones, to better understand factors that affect                                  atomic positions at an interface, and (2) use this                              knowledge to construct surfaces with interesting and                            potentially useful properties.  Their main                                      experimental technique will be medium energy ion                                scattering, a powerful but not widely available                                 method for determining surface structural                                       parameters.  Rutgers' capabilities in this regard                               are largely unique.  By widening the group of                                   collaborators, Rutgers will promote more widening                               the group of collaborators, Rutgers will promote                                more efficient use of its costly equipment.  The                                Chileans will prepare and characterize alkali metal                             overlayers at UTFSM, where Chile's first program in                             experimental surface science is being set up.  The                              laboratory will include facilities for scanning                                 tunneling microscopy, an important complement to                                Rutgers' experimental capabilities.  Through this                               collaboration, both sides will be able to                                       immediately work on problems of international                                   interest.",
