 "awd_abstract_narration": "EmBP-1 is a wheat basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) class                             transcription factor which has been implicated in the control                   of gene expression.  Proposed experimentation will address the                  structure-function relationships of the DNA binding domain of                   EmBP-1.  By analyzing mutant DNA binding proteins with altered                  binding preferences, insight can be gained of the ways in which                 amino acid sequences within the DNA binding domains of bZIP                     proteins encode functional specificities.  The minimal domains                  for the dimerization and DNA binding functions of EmBP-1 will                   be determined using deletion analysis and in vitro binding                      assays.  cDNA libraries encoding randomly mutagenized basic                     region domains will be constructed and probed with degenerate                   oligonucleotides to determine how changes in the amino acid                     sequences of the bZIP domains are manifested in altered binding                 specificities.  The functional significance of these findings                   will be tested in vivo by expressing mutagenized versions of                    EmBP-1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.  Additional, to                        examine the natural variation in bZIP sequences, members of the                 EmBP-1 gene family will be isolated from Arabidopsis.  Because                  the leucine zipper class of transcription factors has been                      conserved from plants to animals, the knowledge gained from the                 proposed research will be applicable to the basic principles                    operating in most eukaryotic cells.                                             %%%                                                                             EmBP-1 is a wheat DNA binding protein involved in controlling                   gene expression.  Understanding the way in which DNA binding                    proteins recognize specific DNA sequences will lead to a                        greater understanding of the mechanisms by which cells activate                 gene expression.  This has great significance in understanding                  normal growth and development as well as in understanding                       aberrant gene expression which is often associated with human                   disease such as cancer.  By analyzing mutant DNA binding                        proteins with altered binding preferences, insight can be                       gained of the ways in which this class of proteins function.                    Randomly mutagenizeds Dna binding domains will be constructed                   analyzed to determine how changes in the amino acid sequences                   are manifested in altered binding specificity.  These findings                  will be tested by expressing mutagenized versions of EnBP-1 in                  genetically engineered plants,  Additionally, to examine the                    natural variation in DNA binding sequences, related genes will                  be isolated from Arabidopsis (a model plant species used in                     molecular genetic studies).  Because this type of protein is                    found within organisms ranging from plants to animals, the                      knowledge gained  from the proposed research will be applicable                 to the basic principles operating in most cells.",
