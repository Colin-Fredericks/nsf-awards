 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an international collaboration in glass                    research between the Industry/University Cooperative Research                   Center for Glass Research at Alfred University and the HVG- a glass             research institute in Germany.  This project implements an                      Industry/University/Government Cooperative Research Program between             the United States and Germany.  The ultimate objective of this                  joint effort is to couple the glass research expertise at Alfred                University with the glass research institute in Germany to conduct              Advanced Glass Processing research which will benefit the industry              members in both Centers.  The research projects at Alfred                       University will investigate the effects of Dealkalization on                    Surface-Related Mechanical Properties of Alkali Silicate Glasses,               the Denist, Wetting Behavior of Glass in Controlled Atmospheres,                and the Reflectometry Measurement of Thin Film Amorphous Films.                 The research projects in Germany will examine the impact of small               chemical additions, basicity and oxidation state on the structure               and properties of silicate glass melts.  These factors strongly                 influence the glassmaking process.                                                   The Deutsche Forshungs Gemeinschaft (DFG) will fund $220,000               per year for three years for the research projects at HVG.  The                 research projects at Alfred University will be supported by the New             York State Legislature at $33,000 per year for three years, DOE                 (through the Westinghouse Savannah River Co..) at $195,000 for                  three years, and the Industry/University Center for Glass Research              at Alfred University at $50,000 per year for three years.                            This project is being cost shared with Dr. Carole Ganz,                    Program Manager of the International Centers Cooperative Program,               Division of International Programs.                                                  The Program Manager recommends Alfred University be awarded                $55,000 for the first year for a three year continuing award.",
