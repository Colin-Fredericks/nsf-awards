 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to hold a U.S. Finnish Auroral Workshop in Helsinki                  from 19-21 March, 1992.  The purpose of the workshop will be to                 review the past collaborations, to initiate new activities, and                 to establish collaborative links between a new generation of                    scientists in both countries.  Significant new opportunities soon               will be available due to recent or upcoming initiatives in                      auroral, magnetospheric, and deep space research.  Finland has                  committed significant financial resources to space research and                 has greatly expanded the number of young scientists.  Finnish                   scientists are presently operating major ground-based observation               facilities, and several groups are involved in the FREJA, POLAR,                CLUSTER, and INTERBALL spacecraft missions.  In the U.S., the                   National Science Foundation has begun a major new program,                      Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), that could significantly                   benefit from U.S. - Finnish collaboration.  Working groups will                 form to identify specific investigations for both near- and long-               term.  We expect 24 Finnish scientists to participate, of which                 many are students and young scientists.  Forty U.S. scientists                  will be invited, and a large fraction of these are also young                   scientists.  In spite of the size of the workshop, limited funds                are requested, and the money will be used almost exclusively to                 support the travel of young U.S. scientists who have not                        participated in previous U.S. - Finnish workshops.",
