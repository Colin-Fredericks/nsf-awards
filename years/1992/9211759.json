 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vast majority of eukaryotic cells contain many mitochondria.                In this organelle, the oxidation of small molecules generates                   cellular ATP, thus providing most of the available energy for the               cell.  A unique feature of mitochondria and related intracellular               organelles is that they are composed of two independent yet                     interacting membrane systems.  Embedded in both of these                        membranes are a variety of channel and carrier molecules that are               responsible for the monumental biochemical tasks necessitated by                this structure; the transport of highly charged molecules into                  and out of the mitochondria.  Many of the molecules responsible                 for these transport processes have been identified and                          characterized in recent months.                                                                                                                                 Many of the recent advances in the field have been made by                      investigators applying disparate technologies and methodologies.                This workshop on \"Molecular Biology of Mitochondrial Transport                  System\" will bring together scientists examining these systems by               different approaches to begin to identify structural similarities               and functionally important interactions.  Although many of the                  individual players are known, the nature of potential functional                interactions and conserved structural motifs have yet to be                     thoroughly explored.  It is both important and timely to bring                  together a multidisciplinary group of investigators examining                   mitochondrial transport systems by different approaches but with                the same overall goal.",
