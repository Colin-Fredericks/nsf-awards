 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bousfield will continue his research in homotopy theory and                will focus particularly on the newly emerging theory of vn-periodic             localizations of spaces.  He will explore unstable versions of                  periodicity results and will work to analyze homotopy types by                  resolving them into vn-periodic parts for positive integers n.                  Bousfield is establishing strong links between the v1-periodic                  localization and the K-theoretic localization of spaces, and this               is leading to solutions of old problems concerning the K-theory of              iterated loop spaces.  He will continue his work, using homotopical             and K-theoretic techniques.  For instance, he will work on the                  development of a K-theoretic unstable Adams spectral sequence.                  Bousfield will also work to extend his algebraic classification of              K-local spectra to cover mapping classes and will continue other                related research.                                                                    The details of these parts vary, but all are concerned with                reducing geometric information to a subject for calculation or to               perfecting the algebraic machinery used for the calculations.  The              nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of the                 difficulty.  While questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes,             and so forth virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is             far different with what are known as topological properties of                  geometric objects.  These are properties such as connectedness                  (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so                  forth.  All systematic study of such properties, for example, how               to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to               one of these properties or are only superficially different, or how             to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all these                have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they have been              reduced to matters of calculation, and two of the principal tools               for this are homotopy theory and K-theory.",
