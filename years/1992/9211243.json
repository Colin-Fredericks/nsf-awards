 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Paleocene Epoch represents the time during which mammals,              particularly placentals, underwent a major adaptive radiation and               became dominant land animals.  Almost one-half of the known ordinal             diversity of Genozoic mammals is thought to have arisen in the                  Paleocene, and many of these first appearances are in North                     America.  This geologic interval is therefore of great importance               in the history of mammals, yet less is known about mammalian                    diversity and composition during the Paleocene than during any                  of the later epochs of the Genozoic.  Particularly weak is our                  knowledge of mammalian history during the transition from the                   middle to late Paleocene (i.e., from the Torrejonian \u0131To! to the                Tiffanian \u0131Ti! North American Land-Mammal Ages), when there was a               significant change in the fauna.  This faunal turnover was                      previously ascribed to climatic change and intercontinental                     migrations; however, our recent work indicates that no major                    immigrations into the Western Interior occurred near the boundary,              and that the scenario of faunal change was more complex than                    previously hypothesized.  By substantially increasing the number of             large samples near the To/Ti boundary, this project will have                   provided the most detailed information with which to study faunal               turnover during this important interval.  Preliminary collections               from one locality n particularly.  Bingo Quarry,indicate that it is             crucial to our understanding of the To/Ti transition.  Study of                 these samples, including those from Bingo Quarry, will                          significantly augment knowledge of the phylogeny, functional                    morphology, paleoecology, and biostratigraphy of To/Ti mammals and              provide the foundation for analyses of faunal turnover.",
