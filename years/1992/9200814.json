 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demographic and social relevance of young adult                        contraceptive use and fertility in developing countries is clear,               yet most research attention in this area has been focused on                    advanced-industrial societies.  This doctoral dissertation project              will investigate sexual and reproductive transitions among 15-24                year-old women in 21 African and Latin American countries for which             Demographic and Health Survey data are currently available.  The                patterns of sexual activity, contraceptive use, and fertility will              be documented, and analyses of their determinants will be performed             an an individual micro-level and at a cross-national, multilevel,               which will test hypotheses regarding how the micro-level effects                are attenuated, magnified, or reversed depending on nation-state                and ethnic group contexts.                                                                                                                                           This project will contribute to our understanding of intra-                national as well as of cross-national differences in sexual and                 reproductive transitions.  It also will provide an excellent                    opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop                independent research skills.",
