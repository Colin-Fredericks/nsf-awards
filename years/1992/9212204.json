 "awd_abstract_narration": "The processes of refuge migration and resettlement have long               attracted the attention of social scientists.  Much research has                enhanced understanding of the ways that refugee populations move,               resettle, and adapt under different physical, social, and                       regional environments.  Geographers have studied different phases               of the refugee experience:  flight, resettlement, repatriation,                 and reintegration.  New approaches attempt to place the refugee                 question within a contextual analysis which concerns how social,                economic, and political structures impinge upon the resettlement                of refugees.  This project will strengthen geographical analyses                of refugees by placing refugee resettlement into a larger context               of time and social space.  The study will conduct a detailed                    longitudinal analysis of unassisted refugee resettlement in the                 eastern Sudan, and it will identify factors which determine the                 pace and scale of repatriation.  Data will come from a survey                   questionnaire, archival documentation, focus interviews with                    local leaders, and interviews with members of the institutional                 hierarchy associated with refugees.                                                  This project will contribute to a better understanding of                  refugee resettlement in three ways.  First, it will place refugee               resettlement in a larger context which will link processes                      operating at different scales of analysis.  Second, it will                     examine how relations within the household are reorganized to                   accommodate the pressures on refugees.  Third, it will uncover                  the specific mechanisms which create differential access to                     physical, financial, and social resources among refugees and                    their hosts.",
