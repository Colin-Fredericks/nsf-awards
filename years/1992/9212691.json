 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-1975) was one of the leading biologists             of the 20th century:  a key figure in the evolutionary synthesis of             the 1930s and author of its first modern statement (Genetics and                the Origin of Species, 1937), he was the founder of modern Western              population genetics, the teacher of a large international school,               and author of many influential popular books on scientific and                  social topics.  Although historians of biology are focussing                    increasing attention on his legacy, this ongoing evaluation has                 been greatly hampered by a lack of information about his formative              years.  Dobzhansky left Russia for New York in 1927 to work with                American geneticist T. H. Morgan, and never returned.                                                                                                           Thanks to recent developments in Russia, it has now become                      possible, using newly discovered archival materials, to analyze the             formative years of Dobzhansky's career.  Under this grant, Dr.                  Adams is beginning to survey these archives in preparation for a                study of Dobzhansky's formative years, 1900-1937.  Working with                 young Russian investigators who have been collecting the pertinent              materials, Dr. Adams is seeking to clarify the influence of the                 Kiev school of cytogenetics on Dobzhansky's chromosomal work (1914-             1924);  the views of his Petersburg mentor, Filipchenko, on his                 approach to micro- and macroevolution, and his social views (1924-              1927);  the influence of Russian entomological traditions on his                approach to populations, species, and field practice; his gradual               assimilation of the conventions and practices of the Morgan                     laboratory; and the influence of his Russian background on the                  writing of his evolutionary classic.  With support from this grant,             Dr. Adams and colleagues are beginning to mine the newly opened                 Russian archives.  This grant provides travel assistance to the PI              as well as instrumentation necessary for his Russian collaborators              to provide him with the needed documentation.  As a result, sources             for the origin of modern population biology will be made available              for study in the US.",
