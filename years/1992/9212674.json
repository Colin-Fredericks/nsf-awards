 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two years ago the National Science Foundation announced                    a number of new programs that support undergraduate computer                    science education, including CISE's Educational                                 Infrastructure Program and EHR's Undergraduate Course and                       Curriculum Development Program.  These programs join the                        current EHR's undergraduate programs of Instrumentation and                     Laboratory Improvement, and Undergraduate Faculty                               Enhancement.                                                                                                                                                    This request is to provide travel funds and a subsistence                       allowance to allow Drs. David Dobkin, Chris Nevison, Juris                      Reinfelds and Joe Turner to attend the ACM SIGCSE Technical                     Symposium on Computer Science Education in March, 1992 in                       order to be members of a panel discussing NSF-funded                            curriculum projects.  Dr. David Dobkin will relate his                          progress with integrating computer science and the arts at                      the undergraduate level.  Chris Nevison will present his                        experience over the past years with three NSF educational                       programs and the development of parallel processing in the                      undergraduate curriculum.  Juris Reinfelds will describe a                      combined development effort in computer science and                             mathematics for the first two pairs of courses.  The efforts                    of Clemson University, Bowdoin College, and the University of                   Connecticut to implement the Computing Curriculum '91 in                        their three schools will be presented by a A.
