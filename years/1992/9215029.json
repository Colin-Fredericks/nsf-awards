The NCES' IPEDS data will provide the National Science Foundation               (NSF) an essential portion of the statistics needed to establish                comprehensive information on undergraduate education.  IPEDS                    collects data from all institutions and educational organizations               whose primary purpose is to provide postsecondary education,                    including much of the information that is needed from baccalaureate             and higher institutions, and it is the only source of comprehensive             data from two-year institutions.  The current proposal will allow               the Foundation to acquire detailed data for each postsecondary                  institution at an early date and to participate in the design of                data editing criteria.",
