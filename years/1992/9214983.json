 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many cities in the U.S. are faced with the problem of combined                  sewer overflows (CSOs).  Combined sewers carry a mixture of                     municipal sewage and storm runoff.  During storm conditions,                    the capacity of such sewers (and/or the associated treatment                    plants) may be exceeded and the combined sewage must be                         released to the environment untreated.  Real-time control of                    the combined sewage conveyance system is a potential low cost                   solution to the problem.  Regulating gates and pumps can be                     manipulated to maximize storage of peak loads within the                        system to minimize the CSOs during each storm event.                                                                                                            The problem described above is the design of a control                          algorithm for a large-scale system.  The PI has adapted Model                   Predictive Control (MPC) strategies and developed a control                     scheme for the Metropolitan West Seattle sewage collection                      system.  The project has involved: (1) optimization of the                      dynamic response of a plant in which there are many                             manipulated variables and many output variables, (2)                            forecasting of unmeasured plant disturbances, (3) accounting                    for inequality constraints on most output variables, and (4)                    incorporating plant dynamics that include integrator states,                    nonlinear characteristics, and lags and time delays.                                                                                                            This research is a one-year case study of the performance of                    MPC on the operation of the Seattle metropolitan sewage                         system.  The application-specific goal is to minimize                           discharge of raw sewage from the network during storm events.                   Simulation studies predict that CSOs can be reduced by 28%                      under MPC (relative to the existing rule-based computer-                        control strategy).  MPC software has already been installed,                    and will regulate flowrates at 23 locations in the network on                   a 10-minute cycle.  Data will be collected automatically                        during each storm event in the 1992-93 rainy season, then                       analyzed off-line to: (1) measure the reduction of CSOs, and                    (2) diagnose any shortcomings in the MPC strategy using                         multivariate statistics.  Data from the use of MPC on this                      large-scale problem should encourage application of MPC to                      similar problems which exist throughout the chemical industry.                  The results will also provide new insights on generic issues                    in MPC, including: (1) impact of (and compensation for) model                   error, unmeasured disturbances, and sensor/actuator failure,                    and (2) formulation of constraints and objective function-ease                  with which competing control objectives can be achieved in the                  MPC framework.",
