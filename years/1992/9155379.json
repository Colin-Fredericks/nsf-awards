 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal provides activities designed to increase the                      quality and quantity of science taught in the high school                       classrooms and laboratories in Southwest Louisiana and                          Southeast Texas.  The program consists of three components:                     (a) workshops in biology, chemistry, and physical science                       designed to provide the participants with the methodology and                   motivation to improve the quality and quantity of instruction;                  (b) peer enhancement activities designed to provide                             participants opportunities to effectively share their learning                  experiences with their peers; and (c) model development                         activities designed for the in-service training of teachers in                  the local school system.  This program will be for three years                  and will involve 102 high school teachers of biology,                           chemistry, and physical science.                                                                                                                                Cost sharing is equivalent to 44% of the NSF award.",
