 "awd_abstract_narration": "As AI planning systems are applied to more realistic problems, the              issue of choosing among alternative plans arises.  The planner                  typically cannot prove that any alternative will or will not be                 successful, and so it much choose among plans on the basis of how               likely they are to achieve their aims and how efficiently they do               so.  Decision theory supplies a normative model for making these                choices, but is not directly applicable to the planning problem as              AI has posed it, and more importantly does not provide a                        computational framework within which to make the choices.  In                   particular, decision theory offers no advice on how to generate or              modify plans.  Decision theory and symbolic AI planning algorithms              therefore offer complementary strengths: the former provides a rich             representation for expressing choice among alternatives and a                   theory of how to make those choices rationally; the latter provides             a computational method for generating and improving plans, but                  under restrictive assumptions.  The two approaches will be                      integrated to produce a practical decision-theoretic planner.  The              research contains theoretical and computational; aspects, the                   former oriented toward reconciling the decision-theoretic and AI                problem representations, the latter oriented toward developing an               algorithm that efficiently builds, evaluated, and chooses among                 plan alternatives.",
