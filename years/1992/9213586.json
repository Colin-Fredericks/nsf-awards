 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the proposed project is to locate study                sites at which alternative models for the evolution of primate                  social systems may be tested.   One theoretical model postulates                that the transformation of one social system to another involves a              discrete and predictable sequence of changes in association                     patterns among males and females.  According to this model, the                 transformation from social systems based upon female kin groups to              groups of unrelated females, involves an intermediate step in which             females do not associate with other females. An alternate model                 postulates the direct transformation of the typical female-bonded,              multi-male groups of savannah baboons into the non-female-bonded,               one male units of hamadryas baboons.  In the latter ecological                  factors are identified that alter the nature of asociations among               females and the nature of relationships among females and males.                The investigator ultimately will test divergent predictions derived             from these models by studying the relationship between                          environmental conditions and social orgnization in two populations              of chacma baboons that vary in their habitat and group structure.               The investigator will survey sites in Namibia, Botswana and the                 Republic of South Africa for feasibility and desirability.",
