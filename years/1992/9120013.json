 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided for the purchase of hardware and software               to install a local area network among the computers (a PS/2-70, two             PS/2-60's, a RISC 6000/320) that serve the Meteorology Program at               Plymouth State College.  Plymouth state is an active and innovative             participant in the UNIDATA program and this award will enable this              college to sustain and enhance their UNIDATA participation.  In                 addition, the proposal seeks monies to network the computers                    serving the Meteorology Program to the PC cluster supporting the                Natural Science Department at Plymouth State.                                        Networking has essentially become a necessary part of the                  UNIDATA Program.  The lack of a local area network has limited both             the educational and research value of UNIDATA at Plymouth State                 even though UNIDATA terminals have been in place for over three                 years.                                                                               As a result of being networked, the Meteorology Program can be             enhanced significantly.  A UNIDATA computer laboratory will be                  taught on the PC's in the microcomputer cluster.  Current weather               graphics and satellite images will be integrated directly into                  course work by displaying them in meteorology classrooms and                    lecture halls.  The UNIDATA Campus Weather Display System will be               installed to give campus personnel and students direct access to                simple WXP and McIDAS graphics and forecasts.  Finally, a network               will provide an easy method of file transfer between the server                 (RISC/6000) and the PS/2 machines, especially when McIDAS is                    officially released under the AIX operating system.",
