 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                        Chemistry Division, Prof. Peter Siska of the University of                      Pittsburgh will study crossed molecular beam reactions                          involving noble gas atoms with other atoms or diatomic                          molecules.  Specifically, Penning and associative ionization                    dynamics will be investigated using Penning ionization electron                 spectroscopy (PIES).  Also included are theoretical studies of                  the scattering of metastable noble gases by atoms and molecules                 on a state-specific level.                                                      %%%                                                                             When an electronically excited atom A* meets a molecule BC, the                 atom may lose its energy by a variety of pathways.  In some                     circumstances the loss of the atom's energy results in the                      ejection of an electron from the intermediate molecular                         complex, leaving a positively charged ion, which may be ABC+,                   BC+, or AB+.  Such processes are known by the name \"Penning                     ionization\" and have been used to elucidate the electronic or                   molecular structure of large organic molecules, adsorbates on                   metal surfaces, and even liquid surfaces.  These applications                   are possible because Penning ionization is sensitive to the                     spatial extent and shape of individual molecular orbitals, that                 is, the molecule's electron clouds.  In this project various                    reactions involving Penning ionization will be examined in                      order to answer some basic questions regarding the mechanism by                 which this process works.",
