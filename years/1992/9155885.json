 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this biology education project is to promote:                    1)the development of curricular materials that facilitate                       learning via a modern biological research approach, 2)                          dissemination of these and previous NSF-supported curricular                    materials, and 3) the establishment and maintenance of a viable                 communication network among biologists, science educators,                      software developers and other individuals who share this                        approach.  Faculty will come together at a summer workshop to                   promote the development of the BioQUEST's open-ended problem-                   solving, long-term research approach to the teaching and                        learning of biology(the \"3P's\" approach: problem-posing,                        probelm-solving, and peer persuasion).  Two-thirds of the                       invited participants will develop materials with a view toward                  addressing implementation of the BioQUEST approach to teaching                  and learning biology and the use of computer tools and                          simulations in undergraduate biology education.  The other one-                 third of the participants primarily will initiate new projects                  in content areas where software tools and computer simulations                  would enahnce undergraduate biology instruction.  In addition                   to materials development, each participant will play a role in                  in the dissemination process by either giving a presentation at                 a professional meeting, conducting a local workshop, or writing                 an article for submission to a journal. Materials developed in                  these projects may ultimately become part of the growing                        BioQUEST library. The effectiveness of this effort in enhancing                 student learning will be evaluated at several sites.",
