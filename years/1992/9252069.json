 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to give our students                           experience with state-of-the-art computer equipment and to                      increase their familiarity with quantitative physics.  To                       address these issues, we have equipped our physics laboratory                   with 12 computer-interfaced data acquisition stations to be                     used with traditional laboratory equipment for measurements of                  heat, light, sound, electricity, magnetism and motion.  These                   data acquisition systems, supported by the appropriate                          software, are capable of data storage, analysis, manipulation                   and retrieval and are therefore more advanced than the                          traditional methods used to perform analysis of physics data.                   Also, the simulation capabilities of the computer are being                     exploited for visualization of equations as well as the                         modeling of physical systems.  Mastery of this equipment                        provides the students with backgrounds for understanding the                    operation principles of other types of equipment using the                      sensor/transducer/amplifier/recorder component series.  The                     simulation experience helps students bridge the conceptual gap                  between theory and experiment and it is hoped that this process                 will lead the student to an increase in critical thinking                       regarding phenomena in the physical world.",
