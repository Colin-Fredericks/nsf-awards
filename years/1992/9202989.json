Angeles                                Paz-Sandoval of the Centro de Investigacion y de                                Estudios Avanzados del I.P.N. (CINVESTAV) in Mexico                             City.  The purpose of the research is to study the                              incorporation of oxygen and nitrogen containing                                 pentadienyl ligands into transition metal complexes.                                                                                                            This award will allow the expansion of a current                                domestic effort studying general pentadienyl ligands                            to the very promising oxygen and nitrogen containing                            analogues.  The Mexican side will focus primarily on                            the preparation of the new ligands, and                                         incorporation of these into metal complexes, while                              in Utah additional efforts will be made to                                      incorporate these ligands into other metal                                      complexes, to study potentially useful reaction                                 chemistry, and to study the natures of these                                    compounds by a variety of physical methods,                                     including single crystal x-ray diffraction.  As                                 metal pentadienyl compounds have already proven very                            useful in metal film depositions and reaction                                   chemistry, it is expected that similar practical                                applications will develop from the oxygen and                                   nitrogen containing analogues.",
