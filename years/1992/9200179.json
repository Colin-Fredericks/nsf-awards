Advertising for the program will begin with               the mailing of information packets to over 200 institutions                     nationwide.  Special efforts will be made to recruit students from              underrepresented groups, including 1) mailing packets to the                    Directors of the MARC program as well as to institutions with                   substantial populations of minority students, 2) attending annual               meetings of minority students in the MARC Program and those from                institutions in California, 3) establishing sister relationships                with two minority colleges (Spelman and Lincoln Colleges) to                    facilitate participation of their students in the Princeton REU                 program, and 4) visiting several other schools whose students are               predominantly from underrepresented groups.  The REU program at                 Princeton is modeled after the undergraduate curriculum in                      molecular biology, which has a strong research component.  A                    faculty committee will select the participants, who will confer                 extensively with the faculty advisor of their choosing to formulate             a detailed research plan.  From mid-June to mid-August students                 will conduct original research with close guidance and supervision              from their faculty advisor and will have many opportunities for                 scientific discussions.  The program will culminate in a poster                 session, at which all participants will present their research                  results to the entire Department.",
