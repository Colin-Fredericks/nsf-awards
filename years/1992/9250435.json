 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a need to expose students to practical problem solving                 methods taught in computer science classes.  This project will                  create an Applied Artificial Intelligence and Robotics                          Laboratory for teaching undergraduate students the theory and                   application of artificial intelligence methods to solve large                   scale real world problems.  The laboratory will consist of four                 NeXT stations, a NeXT cube, a NeXT dimension, a B12 Mobile                      Robot and artificial intelligence software.  The software to                    control the B12 Mobile robot will be developed and downloaded                   directly from the NeXT systems, allowing students to                            concentrate primarily on the practical aspects of problem                       solving. The laboratory will be integrated into the course work                 by dividing the lectures into class and laboratory sessions.                    The class lectures will concentrate on the theoretical aspects                  of artificial intelligence methods and the laboratory sessions                  will consist of experiments that allow the students to                          experience the theory and its interaction with the real world.                  The main objectives and salient features of the laboratory are:                 1) providing at least 40 students a year the opportunity to                     solve large scale real world problems using state-of-the-art                    systems and artificial intelligence software;  2) exposing                      students to theoretical and practical aspects of artificial                     intelligence methods for problem solving;  and 3) providing a                   laboratory facility for interdepartmental use of equipment,                     independent projects and future course development.Since all                    the equipment and software used in this laboratory are                          commercially available, these experiments can be duplicated by                  other institutions.  The results from this project will be                      reported in professional journals.",
