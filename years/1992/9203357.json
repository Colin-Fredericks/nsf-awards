 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objectives of the proposal are to study biased                 sampling models and tests of significance in projection pursuit.                For biased sampling models, penalized maximum likelihood                        estimators will be sought and their properties analyzed through a               combination of simulation and asymptotic analysis.  Techniques                  from isotonic estimation are expected to be useful and new                      techniques will be developed as well.  Significance tests for                   projection pursuit will be studied through simulation and                       asymptotic analysis, probably drawing on recent work on the                     maxima of Gaussian random fields.  It is conjectured that                       coupling methods may yield a proof of the Markov Renewal Theorem.                    Observational studies often encounter or utilize purposively               unequal probability sampling models (referred to as biased                      sampling models).  A long term goal of this research is the                     development of methodology for inference when the (unequal                      probability) selection mechanism can be modeled.  A second aspect               of this research considers projection pursuit, that is, the                     search for underlying relationships in large complex data sets                  with many cases and with many variables.  In particular, criteria               for determining when relationships have been recognized                         accurately will be sought.",
