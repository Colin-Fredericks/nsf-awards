 "awd_abstract_narration": "GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) functions as an inhibitory                       neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of many animals.                 GABA binds to a specific cell membrane protein receptor to control              the activity of the neuron.  The GABA-A type receptor regulates a               chloride ion channel which is also the target of neurotoxins and a              variety of sedative, anxiety-relieving agents and alcohol.                      Recently a new novel GABA-A receptor has been discovered in the                 human eye and its primary gene structure has been elucidated.                   Although its primary structure is similar to the previously                     characterized GABA-A receptor its physiological function is largely             unknown.  These studies are directed at furthering our                          understanding of the interaction between retinal cells, the                     function of the inhibitory neurotransmitter in signal processing in             the retina.  A combined electrophysiological investigation of the               receptor activation on the retinal cells with molecular biological              techniques to produce mutants of the normal receptor will be used               to uncover structure/function relationships of this receptor.",
