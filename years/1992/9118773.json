 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nucleated erythrocytes are utilized as a model system for                    studying biogenesis of the cytoskeleton and its relationship to                 cellular morphogenesis. The focus is on formation of the marginal               band (MB) of microtubules (MTs) and its function in effecting the               change of cell shape from spheroidal erythroblast to flattened                  ellipsoid.  A major objective is to analyze MT bundling as a basis              for MB formation, using a recently developed in vitro system.                   Here, MT bundling is followed by real-time video microscopy during              reassembly of MT protein obtained simply by low temperature                     extraction of cytoskeletons or isolated MBs.  The analysis includes             identification and ultrastructural localization of MT-associated                proteins (MAPs) involved in MT-MT crossbridging, and the use of                 antibodies as potential bundling inhibitors.  The second major                  objective is to test our working hypothesis for stages of MB                    biogenesis and their functional correlation with cell shape                     changes.  This work exploits anemic Xenopus in which erythroblasts              differentiate in the circulation.  Erythroid cells which are singly             and doubly pointed and which contain pointed, incomplete MBs have               been discovered in the circulation of such anemic frogs; these may              represent morphogenetic intermediates.  Experiments include BrdU                nuclear labelling to determine the morphogenetic sequence in vivo               and in vitro, testing of predicted MT polarity in pointed cells,                and study of ;the causal relationship between MB structure and cell             shape.  The work is expected to help settle current controversy                 regarding MT bundle formation and function, and to enhance general              understanding of cytoskeletal function in eukaryotic cells.                                                                                                     The red blood cells of nonmammalian vertebrates are quite different             from those of mammals, in that mammalian red cells lose their                   nuclei during maturation while nonmammalian red cells retain their              nuclei. During frog red cell differentiation, there is a marked                 shape change from the rounded, spheroid shape of the erythroblast               precursor to the flattened ellipsoid shape of the mature                        erythrocyte.  This shape change is associated with the development              of a set of circumferential bundles of microtubules in the plane of             flattening, known as the marginal band (MB), which presumably                   functions to maintain the unique shape of these cells.  This                    proposal addresses two questions with respect to the mechanism by               which MBs develop and function: 1, what non-microtubular proteins               are involved in the bundling process; and 2, what is the role of                the MB in cellular morphogenesis?  In addition to increasing our                understanding of how nonmammalian vertebrate erythrocytes develop,              this project may shed new light on general principles of                        microtubule bundling and microtubule interactions with associated               proteins.",
