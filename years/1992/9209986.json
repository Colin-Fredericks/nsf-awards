Previous research has suggested that people strive to               form impressions of others that are uniform and consistent.  It                 seems that our impressions of others tend to be black or white,                 and gray areas make us so uncomfortable that we work hard to                    reinterpret or ignore information that is contrary to our                       monochrome perception.  However, when people rate the                           decriptiveness of traits for themselves and other, they make                    inconsistent trait attributions.  The goal of this research is to               understand the paradox that coherent impressions of personality                 nonetheless contain inconsistencies.  These studies will                        establish how the use of different kinds of inconsistent traits                 is affected by familiarity and liking for the target, and by the                domain of personality being described.  Inconsistencies in self-                descriptions will be compared with inconsistencies in                           descriptions of others.  A series of principles of coherent                     impression formation will be tested for how perceivers retain                   inconsistent beliefs in coherent impressions of targets'                        personalities, including their own.  The research will contribute               to knowledge about impression formation, test basic theories of                 how social concepts are combined and examine differences between                personality descriptions of the self and others.  The research                  will result in a theory of impression formation that reflects the               complex reality of the way we perceive ourselves and other                      people.  This has implications for the effectiveness of                         interactions in the workplace, at school, and at home.",
