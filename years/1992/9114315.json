Results of the Phase I Small Business Innovation Research                       (SBIR) study indicate that females may gain influence in                        mixed-sex task groups by enacting high task behaviors, but                      that dominance behavior is an ineffective and poorly received                   strategy.  However, although research indicates a strong                        negative group reaction to dominance attempts, it is not                        understood why this occurs.  Furthermore, given that there                      are numerous instances in the applied work world in which                       females as well as males must direct others through implied                     threat, it is important to examine conditions under which                       dominance behaviors may be exhibited without negative                           sanction.  The overall goals of the Phase II SBIR research                      are:  (1) to understand the basis of the normative reactions                    to dominance attempts, and (2) to examine strategies to                         overcome these effects, especially attempts by females and                      other low status individuals to to direct others in task                        group environments.",
