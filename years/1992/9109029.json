 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to analyze, fabricate, and test a new                                class of external resonators containing volume-                                 holographic output mirrors for establishing                                     coherence across two-dimensional diode laser                                    arrays.  The resonators are expected to have many                               new properties that will enhance the performance                                of coherent diode laser arrays.  We will perform an                             analysis of the lateral modes and modal                                         discrimination of this new resonator geometry.                                  Good discrimination properties are imperative for                               high-power operation of diode laser arrays without                              coherence degradation.  We will also study edge                                 effects and resonator optimization by computer                                  models.  Volume-holographic elements will be                                    fabricated to match the desired lateral mode from a                             given diode laser array.  The multi-step process                                consists of using lens design software to calculate                             the required recording wavefront, fabricating a                                 computer-designed diffractive element by e-beam                                 lithography and dry etching, and using the                                      diffractive element to expose a volume holographic                              material.  The performance of the volume-                                       holographic resonator will be studied with a linear                             diode laser array.  We expect this new type to                                  resonator geometry to have significant advantages                               in lateral mode control, efficiency, size, and high-                            power operation.  Small cavity lengths may permit                               future integration into a two-dimensional                                       monolithic structure.  In addition, the basic                                   technology developed in this proposal can be                                    applied to many other electrooptical systems such                               as frequency doublers, solid-state lasers, and                                  complex illuminators.",
