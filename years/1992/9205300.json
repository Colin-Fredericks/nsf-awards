 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will develop and implement algorithms for                the computer modelling of water waves, including the breaking of                waves.  The algorithms will be based on a boundary integral                     formulation together with a time-marching algorithm to advance                  the free boundary.  A number of new numerical techniques, never                 before applied to water wave problems, will be used.  In                        particular, a new fast multilevel technique will be applied to                  solve the integral equations, which is the dominant part of the                 solution process.  The investigators will write a robust and                    efficient computer program, which will be documented and placed                 in the public domain for unrestricted use, e.g., by                             oceanographers, engineers, fluid dynamicists, and numerical                     analysts.  The investigators will validate the code thoroughly                  both through numerical testing and numerical analysis, and will                 compare its results with laboratory experiments.                                     This work will improve the reliability and efficiency of                   computer simulations in  hydrodynamics, such as arise in the                    modelling of off-shore structures, movement of boats through                    water, and tidal energy generation.  Recent advances in computer                algorithms will be adapted and applied for the first time in                    these areas, enabling the investigators to exploit very fast                    computer hardware.  Through the development of a publicly                       available computer code this work will contribute to the transfer               of ideas from theoretical mathematical research to technological                applications.",
