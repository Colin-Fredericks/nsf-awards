 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the ways in which careers and wages are                 affected by the mobility of workers within labor markets.  Most                 jobs are located within an occupation and within an organization                or firm.  The wages paid in a job may depend both on                            characteristics of the occupation and the firm, depending on the                resources characteristic for the occupation and firm.  This study               will examine how such labor market resources affect wages                       independently of individual characteristics of the individual                   holding the job (education, age, effort, for example).  The study               will be based on data from the Current Population Surveys and the               National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.                                                                                                                               This research will contribute to our understanding of how                  labor market structures (occupations and firms) may influence the               wages paid to workers and in particular how the effects of an                   individual's skill, education, and effort may be modified by the                occupational labor market or firm labor market he or she is                     working in.",
