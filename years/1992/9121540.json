 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells communicate with one another via chemical                           messengers (neurotransmitters) which bind to specific receptor                  proteins on the cell surface.  Since many of these                              transmitters do not penetrate the cell their message is                         carried by \"second messenger\" molecules generated in the                        interior of the cell on signal from the outer surface                           receptor-neurotransmitter complex.  These second messengers                     are often G-proteins of which there have been a variety                         identified.  The primary aim of this research is to determine                   which specific G-protein binds to which specific membrane                       receptor (on its interior aspect) to form the physiologically                   functional unit.  These studies will employ a detergent to                      permeabilize the membrane to allow the entrance of purified G-                  proteins and synthetic polypeptides that represent specific                     regions of the native G-protein.  The synthetic segments bind                   and inhibit inative G-protein binding to the receptor                           structure.  GTP associated with a photo-activated component                     that binds to the G-protein and irreversibly activates the                      receptor complex in the presence of the appropriate                             neurotransmitter will also be used to quantitate                                neurotransmitter activation.  The long-term goal of the                         research is to identify the specificity of the                                  neurotransmitter processes for specific cell and organ                          behaviors that lead to our understanding of the molecular                       processes associated with transmission and storage of                           information (learning and memory) in the whole organisms.",
