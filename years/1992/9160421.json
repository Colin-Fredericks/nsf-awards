 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional cost analysis in manufacturing contains many                   assumptions that eventually lead to incorrect decisions.                        Cost accounting does not include adequate production models                     and assumes that costs are linear.  Cost allocation rules                       used in these models may distort the perceived part costs and                   lead to incorrect decisions.                                                                                                                                         The proposers propose a new method of analysis:  a total                   system model.  It creates a complete model of both the                          production system and business expenses.  It uses queling                       theory to model the production system.  Details and benefits                    of this model are included.  The cost model contains the                        production related costs as well as all non-production                          resources and their expenses.  This data needs to be                            sufficient to create a financial statement for the                              manufacturing unit.  Analyzing each production scenario will                    involve building a system model of that scenario.  Decisions                    are made by comparing the system models of each possible                        scenario.  This method of analysis avoids the pitfalls of                       traditional cost analysis and can answer previously                             unaddressed questions in a simple and understandable manner.",
