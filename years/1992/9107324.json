 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical models have been developed to investigate the                  consequences that delayed germination and seed dispersal have for               the ecology and evolution of plants in variable environments.                   These models suggest that dormancy and dispersal are important                  mechanisms for coping with, and exploiting environmental                        variation.  There has been, however, virtually no experimental                  calibration of those models or tests of their predictions in                    natural populations due to the difficulty of quantifying the                    population dynamics of seed dispersal and dormancy.  New research               will apply new procedures, which facilitate the estimation of the               magnitudes of dispersal and delayed germination for plant                       populations, to determine the relative importance of within-                    habitat reproduction, between-year seed bank, and seed dispersal                in natural populations of desert annuals.  The study will be                    performed at the Desert Laboratory of the University of Arizona,                which has the oldest ongoing permanent plot studies of desert                   plants, 88 years of accurate weather data, and 9 years of                       demographic data collected on the proposed study organisms.                          Desertification and increasing levels of human disturbance                 to natural ecosystems are now commonplace.  It is important to                  know to what extent our theoretical concepts regarding the                      ecological and evolutionary consequences of variation are                       actually predictive of what goes on in nature.  With specific                   respect to desert annuals, a large fraction of the flora of                     desert regions are annual plants (frequently 30-100%).                          Investigations of their life-cycles, ecology and evolution not                  only provide a basis for general understanding, but may provide                 some insights regarding their conservation and rational                         exploitation (e.g. in arid land grazing).",
