 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to                                    study the effects of differential excitations                                   along the base of a dam, caused by spatially                                    varying earthquake ground motion.  The                                          standard procedure is to assume that all points                                 at the base of the dam simultaneously                                           experience the same earthquake-induced                                          ground motion - that is, that the dam is shaken                                 by the motion of a rigid plate on which it rests.                               In contrast, this study accounts for phase delay                                and incoherence effects of the base excitations                                 arising from the propagation and scattering of                                  seismic waves.                                                                                                                                                  Appropriate ground motion data are now                                          available from the analysis and stochastic                                      modeling of recent accelerograph recordings on                                  and near earth dams.  The research program                                      involves:                                                                                                                                                       1) The selection of a suitable ground motion                                    model from these data;                                                                                                                                          2) A linear random vibration analysis of a                                      three-dimensional earth dam model to study                                      the effects of spatially varying ground motions;                                                                                                                3) The development of approximate excitation                                    specifications that yield reasonable responses                                  when the dam is analyzed using a two-                                           dimensional model;                                                                                                                                              4) A preliminary assessment of topographical                                    effects;                                                                                                                                                        5) Investigation of the non-linear response                                     using the method of equivalent linearization,                                   with verification by Monte Carlo simulation.                                                                                                                    The results from this research are relevant to                                  safety evaluations of existing earth dams, as                                   well as to the design of new earth dams.",
