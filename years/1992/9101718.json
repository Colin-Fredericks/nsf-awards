 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the development of numerical methods                 designed to assist the computer-aided analysis of nonlinear                     oscillation problems.  The investigator undertakes work on the                  computation of normal forms for certain infinite dimensional                    systems, and a study of the relationship between that and a                     Lyapunov-Schmidt based technique developed by the investigator                  for the analysis of Hopf bifurcation problems.  The use of                      symbolic manipulation software is expected to play an important                 role in this local analysis.  Simultaneously and complementarily,               the investigator will undertake significant modifications and                   improvements of existing simulation and numerical curve tracking                software that he has developed.                                                      The issues addressed and techniques proposed are selected to               promote the analysis of problems typified by systems possessing                 \"time-delay\" effects.  Such so-called functional differential                   equations are important in their own right, and provide a                       transition towards analyzing analogous questions in problems from               fluid dynamics.  Specific problems include models of chugging in                liquid propellant fuel rockets (where the time delay corresponds                to the time it takes to vaporize fuel), oscillations in coupled                 (Josephson Junction) semiconductors, and pattern formation in                   diffusive chemical reactions.  Both the analytic and                            computational aspects of this research are motivated by the goal                of making the mathematical analysis of certain dynamical systems                more accessible to nonspecialists in the field.",
