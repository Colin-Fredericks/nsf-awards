 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has three specific areas of study: Efficient                  Channel-Based Equalization, the computation of the equalizer via                channel characterization derived from embedded training data;                   Interference Rejection for Code-Division Multiple Access, near-far              and intersymbol interference and interference from disparate users;             and Multicarrier Methods for Broadcast Transmission, for mitigation             of time-varying fading effects.   The focus of the study is on the              time-varying multipath data channel.  At relatively low data rates,             the time-varying nature of wireless communication channels often                leads to channel variation over a small number of symbol intervals.             In this case a significant amount of training data can be embedded              in the transmitted packets of data to enable adjustments to be made             at the receiver.  An alternative, perhaps forced by the need for                higher data rates, is to increase the bandwidth of the transmitted              signal. Then the relative rate of channel variation is less                     compared to the symbol rate, and the fraction of training is                    reduced.  As wider bandwidths are used, multipath effects become                more important and more sophisticated receiver structures need to               be used. The research studies both narrow and wideband                          transmission, for applications in digital cellular radio and                    digital broadcast channels.",
