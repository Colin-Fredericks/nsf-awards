 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to develop and empirically test                      strategic bargaining models applied to union contract negotiations.             A prominent feature of the contract data is the holdout:                        negotiations often continue without a strike after the contract has             expired.  Production continues with workers paid according to the               expired contract.  A model was developed that accounts for the                  union's threat choice.  A key prediction of the model is that                   variation in strike incidence is caused by shifts in the                        composition of disputes.  Strike activity varies with economic and              policy variables that change the attractiveness of the strike                   threat relative to the holdout threat.  Preliminary empirical                   results generally support this prediction.  Also there is some                  evidence of a structural shift in negotiations after 1981.                                                                                                      This project will build on these preliminary results.  First, the               data for empirical tests will be added to and refined.  Second,                 estimation strategies that incorporate the main features of the                 theory will be developed and implemented.  Third, the issue of                  permanent strike replacements will be studied.  In particular, the              role that permanent replacements played in the structural shift in              negotiations after 1981 will be addressed.   A theoretical and                  empirical analysis of strike replacements will add to the current               policy debate on whether firms should be able to permanently                    replace striking workers.",
