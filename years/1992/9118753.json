 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of these studies is to gain further                          understanding of the mechanisms involved in regulating or                       generating antibody diversity.  The approach is to examine the                  switch in the spectrum of antibody diversity that occurs during                 development.  Early in ontogeny, in the fetal/neonatal mammal or                in the Xenopus tadpole, the antibody pool is very limited.  The                 sources of this restriction have to do, in part, with the enzymatic             machinery governing Ig assembly: there seems to be a paucity of                 junctional diversity manifested by Lack of N-region sequence                    insertion and a more precisely defined site of recombination by                 use of regions containing homology.  Antibody diversity increases               during development.  In Xenopus, the more heterogeneous adult-type              antibodies appear only with metamorphosis and whenever the process              of metamorphosis is contrived.  This clear separation of larval and             adult immunological states in Xenopus is a unique advantage that                allows more incisive examination of the differential regulation of              the genes involved in antibody repertoire generation.  The specific             aims of the proposed projects are:  1) to isolate Xenopus homologs              of mammalian genes involved in B lymphocyte differentiation (TdT,               RAG1, RAG2, Oct2); 2) to study the ontogeny of lymphopoiesis in                 Xenopus using these markers, with focus on the onset and course of              expression in the larva and changes at metamorphosis; and 3) to                 construct transgenic Xenopus carrying TdT in order to alter the                 normal pattern of Ig diversification during development.                                                                                                        The ability of the immune system to survey and recognize a broad                spectrum of different antigens is based on the huge repertoire of               different immunoglobulin (antibody) variable region amino acid                  sequences and the binding specificities that result.  The Nobel                 Prize-winning discovery, just a few years ago, that this diversity              is generated by a complex somatic gene recombination mechanism has              raised the fundamental question of how this recombination mechanism             is regulated.  In mammals, there is a difference in the amount of               recombination (and therefore in the diversity of the antibody pool)             that occurs in adults vs. newborns, with newborns having a much                 more limited repertoire of specificities than adults.  This                     difference seems to be based on differences in the enzymatic                    machinery needed to effect the recombination events.   In frogs,                this difference is reflected by a change in the ability to generate             diversity at metamorphosis:  tadpoles have a very limited pool of               antibodies, while post-metamorphosis adult frogs have the more                  heterogeneous spectrum of antibodies.  This project will take                   advantage of this distinct difference in immunological states in                tadpoles vs. adult frogs, in order to study the differential                    regulation of expression of the genes involved in the somatic                   recombination events that result in the generation of antibody                  diversity.",
