 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project begins with a meeting of directors of recent and                    current NSF-funded projects in statistics education and                         approximately ten other individuals with relevant interest and                  expertise.  The principal goal is for directors to exchange                     information about their projects, with an explicit focus on                     ways the more adventurous aspects of each project can enrich                    the thinking of other project directors about their won                         projects, and wats to use evaluation and assessment, in the                     spirit of statistical process control, to enhance the                           effectiveness of the projects while they are still in progress.                 Follow up activities include guided electronic mail conferences                 among the participants and the incorporation of the fruits of                   the face-to-face and electronic conferences into a report to be                 distributed electronically to the statistics community.  In                     addition, the report and excerpts from the report will be                       submitted to appropriate publications.",
