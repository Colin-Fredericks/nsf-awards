 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic kinetics of reactions which involve the formation and                 subsequent reactivity of unstable chemical species such as                      multiradicals and zwitterions will be probed. The concurrent                    use of ESR, NMR, and optical transient spectroscopy will                        provide basic mechanistic information which will aid in                         designing chemical reactions involving highly reactive                          intermediates from a rational viewpoint. The research topics to                 be investigated include: (1) the trapping of oxyallyls via                      dimethylfulvene and related agents; (2) production of                           disjointed biradicals; (3) confirmation of the spin                             multiplicity and reactivity of tetramethylene benzene; (4)                      adjustment of the multiplet gap of biradicals based upon                        disjointed tetramethyleneethanes; (5) synthesis of polyradicals                 based upon coupling of two dimethyleneheterocycles via a                        benzene ring; and (6) synthesis and characterization of stable                  biradicals. These chemical systems will serve as models for                     materials with optical, conducting, and magnetic properties of                  practical importance.                                                           %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Jerome A. Berson at Yale                           University. Professor Berson and his research group will probe                  very reactive species, called diradicals, which are formed in                   the intermediate stages of chemical processes and often live                    for only a few billionths of a second. Information about these                  intermediates may make it possible design totally new molecules                 with important chemical and technical properties. The concepts                  to be derived from this work are critical to the understanding                  of how molecules conduct electricity and interact with light,                   and will also aid in the design of chemical systems which can                   be used to make optical fibers to transmit information in the                   form of light pulses faster and more efficiently over long                      distances.",
