 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to support the development,                    evaluation, and export of a new curriculum and supporting                       materials focused around the practice of computing, especially                  in the first two years.  The thrust of the new curriculum is                    based upon a core sequence of closed laboratories.  Lecture                     materials and content will be supportive of the laboratories                    rather than the other way around.  As a discipline, Computer                    Science has seen many dramatic changes in its brief history.                    Through new textbooks and an evolving curriculum, the content                   of undergraduate Computer Science education has for the most                    part kept pace with these changes.  But the pedagogy has hardly                 changed.  It emphasizes individual skill in writing short                       programs in a dead language, from scratch.  This emphasis is                    the antithesis of that needed by a contemporary computing                       professional.  This project develops a practice-centered                        undergraduate Computer Science curriculum, and specifically                     develops a collection of laboratory materials that support this                 approach.  Central to the approach is an increased degree of                    rigor in all courses, coupled with the early introduction and                   subsequent use of modern software development methods and                       tools.The expectation is that this pedagogical shift will have                  the highest leverage for improving Computer Science education.",
