 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steiglitz         The research is on the limits of scalable special-purpose  architectures for highly parallel computation, especially  computation on regular arrays.  Important applications of array-  based computation can be found in digital signal processing, and  in many areas of scientific computation, including many-body  problems with gravitational or coulombic interactions, fluid  dynamics, and wave propagation.  These applications require  highly parallel computation either because of the need for real-  time operation, or because the total number of operations  required is very large.           The basic problems being addressed are:  1.     The design and reliability analysis of large fault-tolerant  arrays, and on-line reconfiguration and error-detection  algorithms for these special-purpose architectures;  2.     The design and analysis of reliable clocking schemes for  very large arrays of processors, especially the comparison of  synchronous, self-timed, and hybrid clocking;  3.     A study of the general issue of cost-effective scaling of  large, special-purpose computer architectures for regular  computations; and,  4.     Extension of the work to Hierarchical Data Computations,  such as those in the fast monopole and multipole methods for  many-body problems, where particles are distributed in space, and  are clustered by decomposing space into hierarchical domains.",
