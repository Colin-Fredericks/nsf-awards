 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective is to design new, conformationally homogeneous,                   enantioselective receptors for functionalized, chiral organic                   molecules such as peptides.  The receptors, that will be                        synthesized from readily available materials, are expected to                   show high distinctions between enantiomeric guests, based on                    previous work.  Such molecules may form the basis of a                          practical resolution method based on chiral polymer beads and                   simple filtration.  The binding data collected will also be                     valuable for testing the computational methods for predicting                   binding properties.  Such predictions are crucial for truly                     rational molecular design.  To use free energy simulations for                  reliable predictions, recent results suggest that impractically                 long simulations may be necessary.  Consequently, new methods                   will be designed to accelerate dramatically the convergence to                  stable free energies.  These enhancements will include the                      development of useful and more realistic continuum solvation                    models, and mixed dynamics/Monte Carlo simulation methods.                      %%%                                                                             With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                 research of Dr. W. Clark Still at Columbia University.  The                     synthesis of enantioselective receptors will be undertaken,                     guided by theoretical considerations.  This will allow the                      chemist to separate the mirror image forms of chiral molecules.                 The ability to do this systematically on a large scale will                     provide an important tool to synthesize the increasingly                        complex substances needed in biochemistry and medicine, as will                 as in the chemical industry.",
