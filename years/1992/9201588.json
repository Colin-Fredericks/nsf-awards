 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. David Meltzer, Ms Rosanna Ridings will               collect data for her doctoral dissertation.  The goal of her work               is to increase the accuracy of obsidian hydration dating and to                 accomplish this she will analyze carefully excavated and well                   controlled samples of obsidian tools from the site of Pot Creek                 Pueblo which is located near the northern Rio Grande, New Mexico.               Obsidian (volcanic glass) because it is easy to flake and holds a               sharp edge was a widely prized material used to manufacture stone               tools.  Because freshly flaked surfaces develop a measurable                    hydration rind and because the depth of the rind is time                        dependent, many scientists have attempted to use rind thickness                 to determine age of tool manufacture.  However, it is also known                that rind development is temperature dependent and that this                    second independent variable must also be taken into account.                    Since climate and therefore temperature fluctuate over time,                    archaeometrists have not determined how temperature measurements                should be taken and how subsequent analysis should proceed.                                                                                                     Ms Ridings' work will help to resolve this issue.  First, she                   will conduct a systematic comparison of the three methods                       currently used for measuring and estimating effective hydration                 temperatures in archaeological sites.  She will then compare the                results.  Secondly, climate of Pot Creek Pueblo will be                         determined over the last 850 years using both tree ring width and               isotopic composition.  The Southwest in unique because of the                   tree ring data which is available.  Finally, she will model the                 depositional history of the artifacts to integrate the change in                effective hydration temperature over time.  She will then use                   these data to analyze the obsidian artifacts themselves.  Given                 past work at the site, the age of these materials can be                        independently determined.                                                                                                                                       This research is important for several reasons.  It will help to                develop and refine an important archaeological dating technique                 which is employed in many parts of the world.  It will also                     assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
