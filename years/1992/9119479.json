The areas of                 chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition                      include:                                                                                                                                                        1.  Charge-Transfer Complexes as Probes of Steric Congestion                        and Facility of Orientational Motion in Self-Assembled                          Monolayers                                                                                                                                                  2.

Electronic Structures of Solid State and Molecular                              Metal Sulfides                                                                                                                                              5.  An Investigation of the Electronic Properties of                                Chelating Fluoroalkylphosphines                                                                                                                             6.

The need to                  accomodate multiple users on the single laboratory computer and                 multiple users on a single chemistry department facility can be                 met by a single solution:  individual work stations for the                     majority of user needs and, for the remainder, ready access to                  other types of work stations and, ultimately, to a mini                         supercomputer.",
