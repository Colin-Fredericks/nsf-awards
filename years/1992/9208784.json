 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distribution of data of a parallel computation such that data                   are accessed free of memory bank and interconnection network                    conflicts, is a critical issue for efficient use of shared and                  distributed memory computers.  Conflicts in memory banks and                    interconnection networks increase inter-processor                               communication delays, which in turn adversely affect the                        execution times of parallel computations and cost-performance                   ratio of parallel computers.                                                                                                                                    This research investigates hardware and software solutions,                     which can be applied in the design of parallel architectures                    for consistent high performance for a variety of parallel                       computations and efficient execution of tasks in a transparent                  manner, even in the presence of faults.  In the first part of                   the research, recent work on hardware techniques, called                        skewed storage schemes applicable at the time of task                           execution, will be expanded upon.  The new techniques will be                   useful to design and use efficiently fault-tolerant and                         gracefully degrading memories, multidimensional memories, and                   memory hierarchies for large data accesses in parallel                          computations.  Suitability of the techniques will be                            investigated with theoretical analysis, experiments on current                  parallel computers, and simulations.  In the second part of                     the research, software techniques, applicable at compile-time,                  will be investigated to utilize and assist hardware techniques                  for partitioning and allocation of data, including heavily                      accessed and hotspot type data.  Effectiveness of these                         results will be evaluated experimentally.",
