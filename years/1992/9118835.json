 "awd_abstract_narration": "In higher plants, root and shoot apical meristems are established               during embryogenesis.  The structures of several shoot apical                   meristems have been deduced by combining histological studies with              clonal analysis.  However, the application of this approach to root             apical meristems has been limited by a lack of visible genetic                  markers.  The aim of the proposed research is to circumvent this                problem by performing clonal analysis on roots from transgenic                  plants containing the maize transposable element Ac in a B-                     glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene.  The gene is normally inactive.              Transposition of Ac activates the gene, however, leading to sectors             of cells expressing GUS.  The distribution of these sectors can be              used to establish whether the root apical meristems generates rot               tissue continuously or in units (phytomers) and whether the                     meristem is organized in single or multiple layers.  In the one                 year period of the present grant, methods will be developed for                 positive identification of GUS-expressing cells, and statistical                data will be obtained relating to the occurrence of different                   classes of sectors in transgenic roots of tomato, tobacco and                   Arabidopsis.",
