 "awd_abstract_narration": "Poeciliids (Pisces, Poeciliidae), the guppies, swordtails,                 and mollies, are a family of small fishes that are frequently                   used as a model system in many biological studies. Research                     topics range from zoogeography, cancer, mating systems, natural                 and sexual selection, comparative ecology, to conservation                      biology. Despite their widespread use, very little is known about               the phylogenetic or genealogical relationships of poeciliids. The               aim of this project by Dr. Axel Meyer at SUNY-Stonybrook is to                  establish such a phylogeny for the poeciliids using mitochondrial               and nuclear DNA sequence data as measures of mutational                         differences between species.                                                         The complete sequence of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b               (about 1100 base pairs) and partial sequences of a nuclear gene,                the proto-oncogene X-src (about 520 base pairs), will be obtained               from several representatives of the species and genera in this                  family.  The use of both mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data                permits the inference of phylogenetic relationship across broad                 taxonomic levels, from species to family, and also provides                     independent checking of the resulting phylogenetic estimates.                   These estimates will then permit testing of vicariance models of                biogeography and other aspects of evolutionary diversification in               this group of fishes.",
