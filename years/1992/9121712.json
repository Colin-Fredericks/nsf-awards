Evans of the Chemistry Department, University of                  California at Irvine, on the chemistry of organosamarium(II)                    compounds.  Attempts will be made to isolate an alkene in a                     cage created by a disamarium tetracyclopentadienyl cavity.                      Reactivity of cyclic monoalkenes and dienes will be tested.                     Coupling reactions of alkynide complexes of Sm(III) will be                     investigated, as will the details of the formation of the                       sterically crowded tris(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)Sm                          compounds.  Further work will also be carried out on the                        recently characterized dinitrogen compounds, especially                         concerning cleavage of the N-N bond and its substitution and                    oxidation-reduction reactions.  The utility of samarium species                 in formation of poly(main group element) ions will be tested as                 will the promotion of reactions photochemically.                                %%%                                                                             This fundamental research project will explore the                              organometallic chemistry of samarium, a lanthanide metal.                       Research on samarium compounds of this type has been limited,                   so the goal of this work is to expand the range of reactivity                   known for such compounds and to determine some of the                           parameters affecting reaction mechanisms.  Not only have                        compounds with unusual structures been prepared, but they have                  also been found to participate in reactions which may have some                 synthetic utility.",
