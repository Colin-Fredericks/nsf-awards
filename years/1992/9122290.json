 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by Experimental Physical Chemistry in                    the Chemistry Division, Prof. Berberian (St. Joseph's College)                  will study rotational motion of dielectrically active molecules                 in solution with non-polar, structurally similar species. The                   temperature, frequency, and concentration dependence of                         dielectric constant will be used to distinguish among competing                 models for liquid state dynamic behavior. By extending the                      measurements to low temperatures, intermolecular forces                         characteristic of the glassy state will be elucidated. The work                 is to be carried out with the aid of undergraduate assistants,                  who will benefit by exposure to modern research equipment and                   methodology.                                                                    %%%                                                                             Some molecules possess tiny electric dipole moments. By                         disolving such molecules in mixtures of electrically inert                      species of similar size and shape, and making the solution part                 of an electric circuit, it is possible to use variations in                     current to study how the surroundings of a molecule influence                   its rotational motion. This is important because at low                         temperatures where the motion becomes extremely sluggish,                       detailed understanding of the intermolecular forces is absent.                  Prof. Beberian's project in this area will lead to an improved                  undertanding of this \"glassy\" state of matter.",
