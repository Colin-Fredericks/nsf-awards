 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-time monitors are designed to filter and analyze patterns in          collections of incoming data streams--for example, to convert low-              level signal and image data into high-level descriptions.  In short,            they are a solution to the \"data fusion\" problem.  This project                 implements the process-trellis software architecture as a programming           methodology and tool for building parallel real-time monitors.  The             project will enable data fusion applications to exploit new                     developments in parallel computer hardware and processing.                           The process trellis supports hierarchical, multiprocess data               fusion structures that convert incoming raw data into high-level                abstractions.  Intermediate processing is performed by numerous                 analysis procedures running asynchronously and in parallel,                     interacting only through the flow of data in the trellis.  The trellis          will be implemented using Linda (R), a commercial product of                    SCIENTIFIC Computing Associates, Inc., that provides convenient access          to parallelism from within high-level languages like C or Fortran.              This will lead to software that is not only efficient, but also                 portable across vastly different parallel architectures including both          explicitly parallel computers and LANS of workstations functioning as           parallel \"hypercomputers.\"",
