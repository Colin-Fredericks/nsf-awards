 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent decades, nonlinear dynamical systems theory, which               includes such approaches and techniques as chaos theory and the                 theory of dissipative structures, has brought revolutionary                     advancements to physics, physical chemistry and fluid dynamics.                 The broad applicability of nonlinear dynamical systems theory                   makes it appropriate for the study of earth surface processes                   such as turbulent flow.  The increasingly complex nature of                     problems related to, for example, global environmental change and               the interconnectedness of geomorphic and related phenomena demand               a more systems oriented approach to their study.  Two major                     schools of thought on geomorphic systems are lodged in North                    America and Europe, respectively.  While North Americans                        emphasize more contemporary processes, Europeans focus on longer                term landscape evolution.  Debates of this nature usually take                  place at major international conferences.  The annual Binghamton                Geomorphology Symposium is the foremost gathering of scholars in                Geomorphology, and in 1992 the Symposium will be organized around               the theme of geomorphic systems.  This project allows five                      eminent geomorphologists associated with the European perspective               on geomorphic systems to participate in the Binghamton Symposium.               Their presence and their contributed papers will provide the                    basis for a coordinated examination of the role of dynamical                    systems theory in the study of surficial processes with the                     ultimate objective of achieving a better understanding of                       physical landscape change on the surface of the earth.                               The Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium  has, for over two                  decades, led the way in advancing the research frontier of                      geomorphological studies.  The geomorphic systems theme provides                an opportunity to explore the utility of nonlinear dynamical                    systems theory for the study of earth surface processes and                     landforms.  It should also examine the potential of geomorphic                  systems studies for predicting the response of earth surface                    systems to large-scale perturbations such as climate and sea-                   level change.  The participation of the five European experts                   will fertilize research in geomorphic systems by bringing                       together geomorphologists from different traditions to discuss                  and inform each other about the dynamic processes which produce                 the variety of landscapes present on the earth.  The symposium                  will investigate the utility of chaos and bifurcation theory,                   dissipative structures, and hierarchy theory for research on the                behavior and evolution of specific geomorphic systems.  It will                 further explore the roles of spatial and temporal scale and                     scale-linkage problems in geomorphology.  This project provides a               unique opportunity to bring together scholars under the auspices                of an established, distinguished symposium format to discuss and                debate the future direction of an important subdiscipline within                geography.",
