 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central equatorial Pacific (EQPAC) is a very large region of                overall high primary productivity that exhibits distinct                        latitudinal gradients in the flux of organic material from                      surface waters to the seafloor.  A problem in modeling global                   carbon budgets is that the rate of organic-carbon mineralization                at the seafloor in this region is not directly related to surface               productivity.  Therefore, a better understanding is needed of the               processes controlling the destruction of organic matter falling                 from surface waters.  In this regard, it is critical to study                   the role of sedimentary microorganisms, especially bacteria.                                                                                                    This project will sample the microbiological communities on a                   USJGOFS EQPAC cruise in  1992. The study will employ a                          multifaceted approach will be used in order to address four                     hypotheses concerned with the effects of changes in carbon flux                 to the benthic environment on: 1) sedimentary microbial biomass;                2) the functional-group composition of the microbial community;                 3) bacterial utilization of carbon (glutamic acid); 4) the growth               rate and productivity of the microbial community.  An ultimate                  goal of this project is to combine these microbiological data                   with those generated by other EQPAC researchers and to determine                the role of bacteria in the mineralization and formation of                     organic matter in these oceanic sediments.",
