 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two parts.  The first part is concerned with developing        models for analyzing competition among financial intermediaries.  The           role of competition in the banking industry is of particular interest.          In contrast to most other countries, the US has a long tradition of             encouraging competition among a large number of banks.  Banks have many         special features which mean that standard economic analyses of                  competition cannot be directly applied.  These special features include         their role as information gathering and processing institutions and the         fact that there are significant switching costs for customers.  Models          which take account of these features and allow their effect on                  competition to be analyzed will be developed.  Four areas that the              project will focus on are (i) competition and the costs of bank failure;        (ii) branch networks and competition; (iii) price-setting competition;          (iv) competition and risk-taking behavior by banks.                                                                                                             In previous work, methods for the analysis of competitive markets with          adverse selection were developed.  Adapting ideas developed in the              context of games with incomplete information, these techniques allow one        to deal easily with situations that might be intractable in an extensive        form game.  In the second part of the proposal, these techniques will           be extended to dynamic contests and to deal with moral hazard as well           as adverse selection.",
