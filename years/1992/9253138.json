Issues to be addressed include rights, permissions and                          royalties; conversion from print to magnetic format;                            software/user interface; and interactions with the CD-ROM                       industry.  The conference will publish a conference report                      which can serve as an introduction to CD-ROM and its                            potential for use in education.  The conference will also                       attempt to develop common features in CD-ROMS for education                     to make the medium easier for teachers to use.  A group of                      educators will be organized to interact with representatives                    of CD-ROM industries to encourage effective use of CD-ROMS                      in education.  The participants will include representatives                    from major EHR funded CD-ROM projects, representatives from                     industries and researchers in the field of CD-ROM                               development, and representatives from the NSF and the                           Department of Education.",
