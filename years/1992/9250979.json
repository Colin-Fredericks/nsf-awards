 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics Pathways - Initial Step is the first phase of a five-                   year initiative in the Department of Physics at North Carolina                  State University to improve and extend opportunities for                        students in lower-division physics courses to learn in a                        technologically rich environment.                                               This Initial Step is expanding the existing program of teaching                 problem solving in physics using interactive courseware                         (Physics 1 and 2) from 50 students per semester to 1,000                        students per semester.  By networking 50 IBM student                            workstations and installing a curriculum manager, we are able                   to offer a one student-one computer learning environment for                    large service courses.                                                          In addition, the expanded PCIC facility is being used twice per                 semester to assess and monitor the development of basic                         laboratory skills such as error analysis, significant figures,                  and curve fitting.                                                              The Physics Pathways program, when fully operational, will                      offer choices to students for how they wish to learn.  This                     Initial Step is helping to initiate the scaling up of both the                  quality and number of microcomputers available for teaching                     large numbers of students.                                                      The problems being attacked by this project are common to many                  large universities.  If Physics Pathways - Initial Step is                      successful, the model we are developing will be transferrable                   to other settings.",
