 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the undergraduate education in Civil                      Engineering through implementation of two new laboratory                        experiences, in which Non-Destructive Test (NDT) methods are                    applied to Steel and Reinforced Concrete structures.  Civil                     Engineers must understand the capabilities and limitations of                   NDT techniques in order to undertake the rehabilitation of the                  United States' aging infrastructure.In the Steel NDT laboratory                 experience, weld quality and the location of cracks will be                     explored using fluorescent penetrant, magnetic particles, and                   ultrasonics; all of this equipment will be acquired through                     this proposal.  In the Reinforced Concrete NDT laboratory                       experience, the location of reinforcement and flaws, and the                    concrete integrity will be investigated using impulse radar, a                  Schmidt hammer, and an ultrasonic pulse meter.   A new high                     frequency (1 GHz) antenna will be acquired for the radar system                 and five Schmidt hammers will be obtained.The NDT laboratories                  will significantly improve the quality of Clarkson's Civil                      Engineering education by giving approximately 100 students a                    year the opportunity to use state-of-the-art NDT equipment in                   hands-on laboratories.",
