 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Conferences on Fluid Properties and Phase                     Equilibria for Chemical Process Design are held every three                     years, presently alternating between North America and Europe.                  The first five conferences have produced highly desirable                       interactions between academic and industrial and government                     workers in this vital area for chemical process design and                      simulation.  The meetings have also become the most important                   gatherings for workers in the area from all over the world;                     the Fifth Conference held in 1989 at Banff, Alberta, Canada                     attracted more than 200 participants from nearly 30 countries.                  Each conference has produced important collections of papers                    in their Proceedings.  The Fifth Conference provided over 900                   pages of reviews and new research when published in the                         international journal Fluid Phase Equilibria.                                                                                                                   The Sixth Conference is scheduled for 19-24 July 1992 in                        Cortina d' Ampezzo, Italy, with substantially the same                          successful format as for the most recent Conferences.  Travel                   funds are provided to support invited speakers and young                        research professors.",
