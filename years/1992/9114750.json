 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past 2 decades, there has been increasing use of                multielemental analytical methods to characterize airborne                      particulate matter and collected precipitation.  With the                       availability of these large multivariate data sets and new                      multivariate statistical methods that have been made practical by               the continuing increases in computer size and speed, there is an                enhanced opportunity to extract information about atmospheric                   processes from data characterizing collected particles or                       precipitation.   The original objective of this on-going research               program was to continue the examination of the statistical                      problems associated with the source identification and mass                     apportionment of urban aerosols.  During the current grant                      period, the program has changed its emphasis toward larger scale                phenomena and the development and testing of statistical methods                to extract information from analyzed samples obtained on a larger               spatial and temporal scale.  Specifically, the PI proposes to                   validate the Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF)                      analysis and Total Potential Source Contribution Function (TPSCF)               analysis Techniques both by applying PSCF to small-scale data                   sets and applying PSCF to the Across North America Tracer                       Experiment (ANATEX) data where the location and quantities of                   source emissions are known, to study  and further develop three-                way modeling via the application of existing methods to                         additional data sets and an investigation into alterations that                 may be necessary to these methods in the presence of constraints,               and the further study of empirical orthogonal functions and their               use in studying ozone transport.",
