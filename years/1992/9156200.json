 "awd_abstract_narration": "To address the need to reform science education in the schools,                 a new course is being developed for future elementary school                    teachers that will internationalize the curriculum and                          demonstrate the impact of science on society.  The objectives                   of the course are to 1) increase students' knowledge of                         environmental and social sciences, especially global issues, 2)                 increase students' enthusiasm to teach about science by                         underscoring its relevance to society and social issues, and 3)                 enhance the capacity of future elementary teachers to teach                     about the environment, global issues and their relationship.                    The course in global ecology will be required for all                           elementary education majors and will be a prerequisite for                      science and social studies methods courses.  It combines                        science and social science perspectives and is to be taught                     jointly by biology and political science faculty members.  A                    special feature of this course will be the development of field                 experiences at St. Louis institutions with a special interest                   in ecological issues, such as the Missouri Botanical Garden,                    the St. Louis Zoo and the St. Louis Science Center.  Alternate                  exercises are being developed to help teachers adapt the                        curriculum to local facilities and conditions.  A                               curriculum/implementation guide is being developed that will be                 presented at a national conference and a local in-service                       conference.",
