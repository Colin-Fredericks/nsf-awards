 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal represents the highest ideal in biodiversity                 research in a developing country.  Relatively few scientists work               with the bryophytes, yet the group has a significant function in                tropical ecosystems.  The PI has already devoted considerable                   time and expertise in the development of moss herbaria throughout               the country.  In addition, he regularly teaches courses on the                  mosses at those institutions, and has inspired Colombian                        scientists and students to work with and publish on the mosses of               the country.  Churchill deposits the first set of each accession                in the largest moss herbarium in Columbia, to which he already                  has given personal collections.  Although funds were not                        requested for development of a database in the proposal, he has                 initiated such a project and has already begun to enter data.                   The materials are collected so that nucleic acids can be                        extracted at a later date.  If A.I.D. funds become available then               this aspect of his work will also be supported.  The moss flora                 of Colombia is exceptionally rich and diverse primarily because                 of the diverse topography and climate.  The PI is making                        excellent progress toward the treatment of the mosses of Colombia               \u0131in Spanish! for Flora de Colombia, for which he is cooperating                 with Colombian botanists, and an English manual of the mosses.                  Thus, this proposal fully satisfies, and exceeds, all the                       criteria for the Biotic Survey & Inventory competition.",
