 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop and analyze interior-               point algorithms for solving large-scale linear programs (LP),                  quadratic programs (QP), linear complementarity problems (LCP).                 This research is a continuation of previous work and is motivated               by the desire to resolve several theoretical and practical issues               concerning interior-point algorithms:  (1) Algorithm Termination:               to develop efficient termination techniques to \"purify\" an                      approximate optimal solution to an (exact) optimal solution, and                to improve the complexity result for a class of optimization                    problems.  (2)  Average Complexity:  to analyze the complexity of               interior-point algorithms for solving random problems, and to                   probabilisticly explain the excellent practical behavior of                     interior-point algorithms. (3)  Asymptotic Convergence:  to develop             and analyze superlinearly convergent interior-point algorithms, and             to improve the algorithms' global and asymptotic complexity                     results.  (4)  Decomposition and Column Generation:  to develop                 various decomposition and column generation schemes for solving                 large-scale practical problems using interior-point algorithms.                     This project will strengthen some of the results from prior NSF             research and explore new techniques and tools for analyzing and                 improving interior-point algorithms.  It will also include                      developing computer routines for solving application problems                   arisen in production scheduling and resource allocation.",
