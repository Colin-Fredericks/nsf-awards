Newly acquired digital storage                             oscilloscopes and logic analyzers enable the students to                        perform a series of hands-on experiments to master the                          principles and practices associated with use of modern                          equipment to increase the accuracy and resolution in electronic                 measurements.  Three required laboratory courses in digital                     circuits, electronic instrumentation, and automatic control,                    are being revised to accommodate the new equipment and learning                 opportunities.  Additionally, a state-of-the-art laboratory                     course devoted to Advanced Electronic Instrumentation is being                  developed and utilizes the new equipment.  The laboratory                       experiments conducted in these laboratories help students                       increase their problem-solving skills related to advanced                       measurement techniques necessary for accuracy, resolution, and                  storage for the analog-to-digital conversion circuits and                       microprocessor-based technology.",
