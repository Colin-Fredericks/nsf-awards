 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuous fiber reinforced ceramic composites (CFCC) will be tested            under fatigue at room and elevated temperatures to study the                    variation in fatigue phenomena with temperature.  Laminated coupons             of SiCf/Si3N4 (silicon Carbide fiber reinforced Silicon Nitride                 matrix) composites with symmetric layups will be subjected to                   tensile-tensile fatigue.  Prior to fatigue tests, tensile properties            will be characterized at various temperatures to determine the                  strength, and to decide about specific temperatures at which the                elevated temperature fatigue tests are to be conducted.  Room                   temperature fatigue tests will be performed at various stress ratios            ranging from 0 to 0.5, and which frequencies varying from 1 to 10               Hz, to observe their effects on the fatigue life of the composite.              High temperature fatigue tests will be conducted under isothermal               conditions to maintain the cyclic loading as the main driving force             for the composite failure.  NDE and SEM characterization will be                performed to evaluate the damage and the failure characteristics of             the composite.  Parallel to mechanical testing, finite element                  analysis will be performed to investigate the non-linear response of            the laminate under tensile and fatigue loading.  Layered shell                  element developed on the basis of first order shear deformation                 theory will be used.  Both large deformation and plastic strain                 behavior will be considered to account for the geometric and                    material non-linearities in the analysis.  Cumulative fatigue damage            bases on the Miner's rule and the experimental S-N curve, will be               simulated in the finite element model to study the laminate response            under two and three stress level cyclic loading.  Few specimens will            be tested under cumulative fatigue to verify the FEM results.                                                                                                   The proposed research will be conducted by three faculty associated             with the Tuskegee University's Materials Research Laboratory (MRL)              which is a multi-disciplinary facility developed for synthesis and              characterization of high performance materials including advanced               composites.  It is proposed to involve six minority graduate                    students and six minority undergraduate students over a period of               three years.  The program will also allow the sponsoring department             to recruit talented minority faculty and students.",
