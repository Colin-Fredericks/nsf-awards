 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is directed toward                               the formation of non-spiking ohmic contacts to                                  p-type InP.  It is proposed here to apply the                                   principle of solid phase regrowth (SPR) to                                      fabricate such contacts to p-InP.  Shallow                                      contacts (reaction depth<100A) of mid 107n-                                     cm2 contact resistivity have been achieved on n-                                 and p-type  GaAs by the SPR method.  The                                       regrowth process begins with a low-temperature                                  reaction between a metal M (e.g. Pd or Ni) and                                  a compound semiconductor substrate, AB, to                                      produce an intermediate ternary MxABy phase.                                    A subsequent reaction at a higher temperature                                   between an overlayer of Si, Ge, or In and the                                   intermediate phase results in the decomposition                                 of the intermediate phase and the epitaxial                                     regrowth of a layer of the compound                                             semiconductor doped or alloyed with the                                         overlayer element.  The nonstoichiometry of the                                 intermediate ternary MxABy phase (i.e. where y                                  is not equal to 1) will allow the doping element                                to occupy the preferential sites (site selection                                mechanism), thus forming a highly doped                                         surface regrown layer.  A thin layer of doping                                  element (i.e. Mg, Mn, Si, or Ge) imbedded in                                    metal M has been used to successfully                                           intentionally dope the regrowth layer to reduce                                 the contact resistivity significantly.  In this                                 project, the Pd- and Ni-based contact system                                    will be investigated since ternary compounds                                    such as Pd4.8InP and Ni2.7InP have been observed                                between Pd, Ni and InP at low temperatures.                                     Overlayers of Ge, Si, In or Sb will be                                          investigated to drive the decomposition of the                                  Pd (or Ni) ternary compounds and the epitaxial                                  regrowth of Inp. The effects of a thin layer of                                 embedded acceptor element on the electrical                                     characteristics (i.e. Mn, Mg, or Zn) will be                                    carried out.  In this research cross-sectional                                  transmission electron microscopy and backside                                   secondary ion mass spectrometry will be used                                    for structural investigation, and Transmission                                  Line Model measurements will be utilized for                                    electrical measurement.  The SPR contacts are                                   expected to provide more uniform interfaces and                                 lower contact resistivity compared to.",
