Crawford of Ohio State University, Dr.                                       Edwin B. Smith of the University of Arkansas                                    and Dr. Aundio Sagastegui of the Universidad                                    Antenor Orrego de Trujillo, Peru.  The                                          project will initiate studies of the                                            systematics and evolution of South American                                     representatives of the Genus Coreopsis                                          (Asteraceae).  Thirty four species are                                          described from South America with the vast                                      majority occurring in the northern Andes of                                     Peru and all assigned to the sect.                                              Pseudoagarista.  Little is known about the                                      species beyond the alpha-level, with most of                                    the taxa described primarily on leaf                                            morphology.  The collaborative effort will                                      involve the following methods: field studies                                    to assess morphological variation within and                                    among the described species, specimen                                           collection to document this variation,                                          gathering of floral buds and collecting seeds                                   and dried leaf material; determination of                                       chromosome numbers for each species; the use                                    of enzyme electrophoresis to estimate genetic                                   variation within and divergence among                                           species; and the use of morphology and                                          chloroplast DNA restriction site variation to                                   construct phylogenic hypotheses for South                                       American Coreopsis and for all of Coreopsis.                                                                                                                    The project will provide insight into                                           systematic-evolutionary aspects of the genus                                    Coreopsis and will allow a synergistic                                          relationship to develop among the three well-                                   qualified investigators.  The project will                                      present resources and research opportunities                                    currently unavailable to the Peruvian                                           principal investigator and will involve                                         Peruvian students.  Since this type of                                          research also provides for the rapid exchange                                   and dissemination of knowledge, the project                                     will fulfill the goals of the Science in                                        Developing Countries Program.",
