 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop effective numerical methods              for solving complex nonlinear optimization problems.  The                       algorithms to be developed and analyzed follow two distinct but                 related approaches:                                                                       - Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods; and                           - Barrier methods (i.e. interior methods).                            This research will concentrate on large-scale problems, direct                  treatment of sparse linear and nonlinear constraints, and the                   guarantee of superlinear convergence.                                                                                                                           The research on SQP methods will extend techniques based on                     linearly constrained subproblems and an augmented Lagrangian merit              function.  Topics to be considered include use of a reduced                     Hessian, use of exact second derivatives, strategies for accepting              inexact solutions of subproblems, and techniques for treating                   infeasible subproblems.                                                                                                                                         Work in barrier methods have already proved remarkably successful               for linear programs.  Much research remains to improve their                    reliability and to extend their application to large-scale                      nonlinear (and convex) problems.  Research in barrier methods                   emphasizes matrix factorization rather than matrix updating, and                can utilize the substantial body of research on factorization                   methods for machines with parallel and vector architectures.  We                propose both direct and iterative methods for solving the                       indefinite systems involved.",
