 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project described in this proposal involves the design and                  implementation of a speech driven computer interface which could                be used as a communication tool for the disabled.  The approach                 outlined involves the use os parallel filter banks, followed by                 various signal processing stages and a gamma network composed of                gamma memory sections and a back-propagation neural network.  The               system will be designed for use on a NeXT computer, which                       contains a microphone and a DSP chip, so that no additional                     hardware will be required.  The investigators will test the                     system on isolated words although one of the justifications for                 the neural network approach is so that a continuous signal stream               could be processed without necessitating the segmentation of the                speech signal into allophones or words.  It is expected that this               approach will perform better than techniques that are presently                 used on low cost computers.  Because this approach uses networks                designed to process time-varying signals in a speech recognition                system it could have an impact on the technology in this area if                it can be extended to process continuous speech.",
