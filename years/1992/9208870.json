The researchers will focus                        on supported vanadium oxide catalysts because of the                            importance of these catalytic materials, their use as                           model systems in the literature, and the prior research                         efforts of both investigators with these materials.  The                        results of this project will be an improved understanding                       of the nature of metal oxide interactions with oxide                            supports useful in attempts to modify the mechanical,                           physical, and chemical properties of solid metal oxide                          surfaces (e.g.: biomaterials, ceramics, coatings,                               electrodes, electronic devices, optical devices, pigments                       superconductors, and sensors).                                                                                                                                  This project in chemical engineering fulfills the program                       objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                      combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas                       of strong mutual interest and competence.",
