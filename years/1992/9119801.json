 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general objectives of this proposal are to relate the                  phylogenetic trees derived from molecular sequences from extant                 taxa to the geological, paleontological, and biochemical records;               to changes in the atmosphere and biota; and to the origin of                    present day life.  Three specific objectives are: (1) to test                   theories for the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus and to seek to                identify its prokaryotic sister taxon; (2) to relate phylogenetic               trees to the origin of metabolic innovations, such as the                       beginnings of photosynthesis, oxygen production, methanogenesis,                and sulfur reduction and oxidation; and (3) to relate the                       phylogenetic tree to the fossil and geological records, through                 correlation with such factors as the time of appearance of oxygen               in the atmosphere, the isotopic abundances of sulfur and carbon,                the appearance of prokaryotic fossils, and with endosymbiotic                   events.                                                                              Specific goals are to sequence three molecules (EF-Tu, Ef-G,               and the trp B gene) from a diverse group of twelve taxa that                    exhibit metabolic innovations that are essential to understanding               early events in life.  Phylogenetic trees will be inferred, paying              particular attention to artifacts of sequence alignment deriving                unrooted phylogenetic trees from molecular sequences.  The EF-Tu                and trp B genes are particularly useful because they have low rates             of nucleotide substitution and because EF-Tu and EF-G arose through             an early gene duplication so that the tree can be rooted using                  these paralogous genes.  Taxa have been chosen to assist in                     identifying the sister taxon to the eukaryotic nucleus, and to be               useful in asking what were the earliest types of metabolisms.",
