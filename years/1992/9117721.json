 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an examination of the physical and structural                   properties of the antarctic ice pack in the Amundsen,                           Bellingshausen, and Ross Seas, with the goal of defining the                    geographical variability of various ice types, the deformation                  processes that are active in the antarctic ice pack, and the                    large-scale thermodynamics and heat exchange processes of the ice-              covered Southern Ocean.  An additional goal is to relate specific               characteristics of antarctic sea ice to its synthetic aperture                  radar (SAR) signature as observed from satellites.                                                                                                              Physical properties include the salinity, temperature, and brine                volumes, while structural properties include the fraction of                    frazil, platelet, and congelation ice of the seasonal antarctic                 pack ice.  Differences in ice types are the result of differences               in the environment in which the ice forms: frazil ice is formed in              supercooled sea water, normally through wind or wave-induced                    turbulence, while platelet and congelation ice is formed under                  quiescent conditions.  The fraction of frazil ice (which has been               observed to be generally in excess of 50% in Weddell Sea ice floes)             is an important variable in the energy budget of the upper ocean,               and contributes significantly to the stabilization of the surface               layers.                                                                                                                                                         The integration of sea ice field observations and synthetic                     aperture radar data analysis and modeling studies will contribute               to a better understanding of sea ice parameters and their                       geophysical controls, and will be useful in defining the kind of                air-ice-ocean interactions that can be studied using SAR data, as               well as having broader relevance and application to atmospheric,                biological, and oceanographic investigations of the Southern                    Ocean.",
