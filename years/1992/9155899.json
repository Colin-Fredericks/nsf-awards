The materials which are                        developed are drawn from recent research in the area of                         Bioengineering which focuses on such topics as : rehabilitation                 engineering , bioacoustics, biomaterials computational                          neurosciences, bioinstrumentation and medical imaging. The                      materials which are developed are used in courses in science                    teaching in the College of Education and are also integrated                    into the introductory Bioengineering course in the College of                   Engineering. The materials are also considered for adaptation                   to a form appropriate for direct use by students in the K-12                    curriculum.",
