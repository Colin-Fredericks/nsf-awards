 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to isolate and analyze the                       economic consequences of the Marshall Plan.  Remarkably enough,                 there does not exist a single, systematic study analyzing the                   economic impact of the Marshall Plan, despite the fact it was one               of the great successes of American foreign policy in restoring                  the economic strength of Europe after World War II.  This                       research is particularly timely given the break up of the Soviet                Empire and the current debate about how best to construct an                    economic assistance program by the Western Democracies.  The                    findings of this project could provide useful insights as to how                an aid program might be structured.                                                                                                                             Specifically, the project will take three approaches to analyzing               the impact on economic growth of U.S. aid to Europe after World                 War II.  The first, an aggregate approach, will develop an                      analytic framework that takes as its point of departure the two-                gap literature in development economics.  An empirical model of                 the channels through which the Marshall Plan affected aggregate                 output growth will be developed and estimated for the period 1945               to 1955.  The second is a sectorial approach which will use                     input-output tables and data on aid-financed commodity imports to               assess the role of the Marshall Plan in removing sectorial                      bottlenecks.  The third is political economy approach which will                develop and use models of collective decision-making to analyze                 the allocation of U.S. aid.",
