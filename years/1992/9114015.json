 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted to extend and develop the theory of                  scattering of small mass particles by surfaces, with emphasis on                interactions in which many quanta of energy are exchanged during                the collision.  A fundamental and quantum mechanical approach will              be used initially, and then the theory will be extended to                      semiclassical limits at various levels in order to investigate the              transition from the quantum mechanical to the classical regime.                 Initial results indicate that the diffusely scattered intensity,                due to multiple phonon interactions is insensitive to fine details              in the phonon density of states, and this will be further                       investigated for realistic surface models.  This lack of                        sensitivity in the phonon spectra implies that the multiphonon                  contribution to the intensity will give directly the form factor,               or transition matrix, for the atom-surface interaction potential.               Analysis of available data will give the form factor as a function              of exchanged energy and momentum, which will in turn lead to a                  determination of better models of the interaction potential.  The               data analysis will involve visits and some collaboration with the               major experimental groups in the area of helium-surface scattering.             The work will lead to applications in other related areas of gas-               surface interactions including calculation of accommodation                     coefficients, sticking and desorption, electron-hole pair creation              during collisions and scattering from disorder.                                 %%%                                                                             Theoretical research will be done on the interaction of small                   particles scattering from surfaces in which there are many                      exchanges of quantized energy and momentum.  These calculations                 will lead to more accurate determinations of the forces which exist             between the impinging particles and the surface and will develop a              powerful formalism to deal.  The work will be closely correlated                with various experimental groups.",
