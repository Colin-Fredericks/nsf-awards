 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important aspect of this program is that the observational                   data from this campaign will be made available to all interested                solar physicists.                                                               The instrument that is proposed will be a small, low-scattered-                 light refracting telescope consisting of a 15-cm doublet, a fast                guider, a 0.2 nm CaII K filter and several additional filters for               continuum observations at other wavelengths, and a commercial                   2048x2048 CCD camera.  The entire enclosed telescope package will               be on an equatorial mount.  Data rates will be sufficiently low                 that a pc-class computer can be used for both telescope control                 and data acquisition.                                                           This proposal will aid in making the High-Degree Helioseismometer               data available to the community.  This instrument, which was                    operated last year at the South Pole, has been installed at the                 Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope, and is now producing high-quality Ca                K-line images.  With the modest help requested here, these data                 will be made available to the community on a weekly basis.  This                will start important science associated with the Sun's variable                 radiative output now.  In addition, the project can begin                       purchasing equipment needed for a future RISE PSPT telescope.",
