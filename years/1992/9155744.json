 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much research evidence suggests that students become                            disenchanted with science because their science classes                         overemphasize microscopic models of phenomena and formal                        methods of analysis and also fail to integrate everyday and                     scientific reasoning.  This project will develop and                            evaluate a new approach to science teaching and learning                        that is rigorous as well as pragmatic, useful, and engaging                     for students.  We will focus on improving introductory                          science courses so that they attract and retain students and                    meet the needs of society and the demands of the workplace.                     Specifically, we will identify goals for science courses                        that are both rigorous and useful, develop assessments that                     both educate students and inform teachers, investigate                          classroom partnerships between teachers, students, and                          computers that are both efficient and effective, and conduct                    longitudinal case studies of participation and persistence                      in science that are both interactive and retrospective.                                                                                                         Building on our recent research on teaching and learning, we                    will seek to provide a new, more substantial research base                      for science education reform.  We will refine our proposed                      solutions by conducting in-depth studies of students in                         small groups.  We will then test these solutions in middle                      school classes taught by a project team member.  Finally, we                    will study students longitudinally from the eighth grade                        through high school to determine the effect of our approach                     and related interventions on persistence and participation                      in science courses and careers.  By comparing the beliefs                       and decisions of students who tend not to participate in                        elective science courses to those of students who aspire to                     be scientists, we will be able to provide a much richer                         understanding of persistence and participation than has been                    provided by other investigations.",
