 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental research aimed at elucidating principles that underlie              the conservation and restoration of biological diversity is of                  utmost importance.  This is the priority of Dr. Owen's research                 program.  The goal of this project is to continue his work at the               Santa Rosa National Park in Costa Rica on an endangered marine                  species.  These animals and several other large vertebrates in the              region are under severe over exploitation and accidental capture                pressure in their oceanic environment which, in turn, is causing                dramatic drops in their population.  Previous NSF support has                   resulted in state-of-the-art research on some of the most difficult             problems in marine animal biology.  Dr. Owens will now employ small             satellite, sonic and radio transmitters to monitor the migratory                behavior of these sea-going animals.  In addition, he will measure              the level of steroid hormones to determine the correlation between              endocrine physiology and reproductive and migratory behaviors.  A               major collaborative research effort has been established between                Dr. Owens and Costa Rican students and scientists.  Their goal is               to gain new insights into understanding the conservation of these               animals within their natural habitat.  The outcome of this work                 will not only provide a more complete understanding of their basic              biology but may lead to improvement in the conservation and                     survival prospects for this economically valuable marine species.",
