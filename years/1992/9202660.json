 "awd_abstract_narration": "The second order differential equations of motion governing the                 vibrations of a linear, viscously damped, discrete system are                   generally mutually coupled. The damping is said to be classical                 if and only if the equations of motion can be uncoupled by an                   undamped modal expansion. This proposal examines the problem, for               the case when the viscous damping is nonclassical, of how best to               uncouple and solve the governing equations of motion by                         approximation, with a real-valued coordinate transformation. It                 is proposed that the matrix equation of motion, with its mass                   matrix transformed to a unit matrix, be transformed by an                       orthogonal coordinate transformation to a new generalized                       coordinate system in which the bound on the norm of the error                   introduced in the response by discarding all the coupling terms                 is a minimum. A trial evaluation of this method is                              computationally effective for solving certain types of                          nonclassically damped systems. The proposal describes the general               approach and delineates the research plans for a comprehensive                  study of the proposed method. The proposed method has application               to large, multi-degree-of-freedom vibration problems in                         aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering.***    //",
