 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with removing divalent metal ions,                   present in dilute amounts, from aqueous solutions by ligand                     modified micelle enhanced ultrafiltration.  In this method,                     surfactant molecules are added to the aqueous solution in                       concentrations exceeding the CMC so that the molecules form                     micelles.  Micelles are aggregates of surfactant molecules in                   which the nonpolar chains of different molecules extend and                     stack together to form a ball-like hydrophobic core with the                    polar parts surrounding the core and remaining in contact with                  the aqueous phase.  Also added to the aqueous solution are                      metal complexing ligands consisting of a hydrophic tail and a                   moiety which complexes with the metal ion.  The ligand                          complexes the metal ion, and the ligand-metal assembly                          attaches itself to the micelle by solubilization of the                         hydrophobic tail into the membrane interior.  The aqueous                       solution is then forced through a membrane which does not                       allow passage of the micelles.  Thus the metal ion is                           retained, attached to the micelle, in the retentate on one                      side of the membrane, and the permeate contains a reduced                       level of the ion.                                                               The feature of this separation which is most attractive is its                  selectivity.  Ligands can be engineering which exclusively                      bind to a particular metal ion.  Therefore an aqueous solution                  that has only one ion at an undesirable high concentration can                  be cleansed of that ion without wasting materials on the                        removal of other ions.  The PI and CoPIs received an NSF grant                  to develop the process and study its selectivity in 1988.  As                   reported in the section of the proposal \"Results from Prior                     NSF Support\", research supported by the previous grant                          demonstrated the feasibility of the separation.  In                             particular, in a stirred-cell ultrafiltration of a solution                     containing a mixture of Cu2+/Ca2+, using the ligand NIDA which                  binds the copper ion prefentially, rejection of copper was                      upwards of 90 percent.                                                                                                                                          The present proposal extends the technique developed in the                     previous grant to the specific selective removal of divalent                    Pb2+, UO22+, Hg2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Ca2+ and synthesizing                   new ligands.  Binding constants of the ligands with ions, and                   their protination constants will be measured when the ligand                    is free in solution and solubilized in a micelle.  These                        measurements will be undertaken by a combination of titration                   and dialysis experiments.  Ultrafiltration experiments will be                  undertaken using a spiral wound membrane module.  The proposal                  remarks that this configuration allows for modelling of the                     laminar boundary layer, and concentration polarization                          phenomena.",
