 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two regulatory proteins alpha 1 and MCM1 from the yeast                         Saccharomyces cerevisiae cooperate to activate transcription of                 alpha cell type specific genes.  MCM1 protein, which is homologous              to the mammalian serum response factor, is a multifunctional                    protein implicated in several processes in the yeast cell.  Both                the alpha 1  and MCM1 proteins bind their DNA recognition sequence              in both duplex and single stranded DNA.  Since most DNA binding                 proteins recognize B form DNA and contact the sugar-phosphate                   backbone, this is an unexpected activity.  The hypothesis that the              proteins unwind duplex DNA to generate single stranded DNA will be              tested; thus two apparently different activities could be in                    reality a single activity.  The relationship between the duplex and             single strand binding activities will be analyzed by comparing 1)               the protein-DNA contracts, 2) the sequence requirements for binding             and 3) the domains of the proteins required for each type of                    binding. Selection of a alpha 1 mutations in vivo will be used to               extend mapping of the domains.  The unusual binding properties of               other proteins are integral to their function.                                  %%%                                                                             This research, which deals with issues potentially very important               for eukaryotic gene expression, has the potential for wide                      applicability in biotechnology. It is an interesting and                        potentially significant phenomenon, and the research planned will               help to delineate the biological role for the unusual findings to               date.  The planned research will also provide useful training for               student associated with the project.",
