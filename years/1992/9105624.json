 "awd_abstract_narration": "The insulin receptor binds its ligand, insulin, at the plasma                   membrane of the cell. This binding event initiates two processes:               1) Autophosphorylation of the receptor protein on tyrosine                      residues. This autophosphorylation ultimately leads to the changes              in cellular metabolism associated with insulin action. 2)                       Endocytosis of the insulin-receptor complex and the subsequent                  movement (routing or trafficking) of the receptor through the                   multiple compartments of the endosomal pathway. Both of these                   processes are affected by chronic treatment of the cultured cells               with either insulin or glucocorticoids. The hypothesis to be tested             in this project is that the key step by which these hormones                    regulate cellular insulin receptor number is by regulating the rate             at which the receptor is inactivated and degraded. From previous                work, the inactivation and degradation of the receptor occurs                   within the endosomal compartment. Therefore, the hypothesis will                be tested through the following goals: 1) The various endosomal                 compartments through which the active insulin receptor moves in the             basal or hormone-simulated states will be isolated by preparative               isoelectric focusing. By metabolically labeling the receptor with               32 P-phosphate, changes in the autophosphorylation state of the                 receptor as it moves through the endosomal compartments will be                 quantified. 2) The mechanism(s) by which the insulin receptor                   protein is inactivated will be determined in the basal and hormone-             stimulated states. Isoelectric focusing will be utilized to                     ascertain the endosomal compartment in which inactive receptor is               activated. The enzymes responsible for these processes will be                  characterized and isolated.                                                     These studies will provide the first characterization off the                   physico-chemical status of a receptor protein as it moves through               the various compartments of the endosomes, and will provide a                   mechanism by which a membrane-bound receptor is inactivated and                 removed from the cell.",
