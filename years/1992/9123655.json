 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and William W. Menasco of SUNY-Buffalo have               recently proved an enhanced version of the venerable Tait                       conjecture for alternating knots, as well as the cabling conjecture             for alternating knots.  They will broaden their investigations into             geometric questions concerning specific families of links.  They                will seek to characterize knots of unknotting number one within                 certain classes, for instance the classes of alternating knots,                 Montesinos knots, and arborescent knots.  They hope to establish an             effective procedure for determining the unknotting number of knots              within these classes.  They will also seek information on the                   unknotting number of a cabled knot and will investigate the old                 conjecture that unknotting number is additive with respect to                   connected sum.  They will seek to prove that alternating knots have             property P, that all boundary slopes of alternating knots are even              integers, and that alternating links are determined by their                    complements.  They will endeavor to develop techniques for                      constructing essential laminations in alternating knot exteriors,               and in the case where the boundary slope is rational, they will                 examine the completions of these laminations in the closed manifold             obtained by appropriate Dehn filling.                                                Knots are rather elementary geometric objects whose really                 interesting properties are topological.  By this we mean that two               geometric knots do not differ in an interesting way if one of them              can be transformed to look just like the other without cutting or               untying it, just by pushing its string about to rearrange the                   crossings.  Topologists say that they are two different geometric               realizations of the same topological knot.  Nevertheless, it is not             a trivial matter to recognize when one complicated geometric knot               is topologically different from another, rather than just a                     different geometric realization.  This problem can be addressed by              computing certain numbers or polynomials which are called                       \"topological invariants,\" meaning that they always have the same                value for different geometric realizations of the same topological              knot.  The problem would be reduced to pure algebra if there were               one invariant which also always had different values for geometric              realizations of different topological knots, but life is not so                 simple -- no single invariant achieves this ideal, nor even all the             known invariants taken together.  It is therefore valuable to                   investigate new invariants, some of the most useful being those                 inspired in recent years by ideas from quantum physics.  The                    investigator has been in the thick of this activity and has been                particularly successful in applying some new polynomial invariants              to settle old questions about alternating knots.  He will continue              to exploit these techniques.",
