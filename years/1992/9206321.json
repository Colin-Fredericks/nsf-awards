 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies will continue on the regulatory-metabolic network that                  modulates uptake, synthesis and utilization of tryptophan in                    Escherichia coli.  The effects of nutritional shifts will be                    examined in wild type, and in mutants lacking specific regulatory               functions.  Global effects of the TyrR protein will be explored.                in vitro band shift analyses will be performed with RNA polymerase,             trp superrepressor, and various target operators, to determine the              basis of the differential in vivo regulation of transcription                   initiation in the four operons controlled by the trp repressor of               E. coli.  in vivo experiments will be performed to determine the                effects of replacing the normal repressor by a slowly dissociating              superrepressor.  Second and third site revertants will be isolated              in tryptophan synthetase a mutants altered in catalytic residues;               residue changes should reveal important features of the active site             of this protein.  The basis of the defects in Crawford's trpB                   repairable mutants will be examined.  The amino and carboxy                     terminal segments of the tryptophan synthetase chains of E. coli                will be systematically altered in an effort to explain the order of             gene fusion that occured during evolution of the fused tryptophan               synthetase structural gene of fungi.                                            %%%                                                                             Much of what is known about metabolism of the amino acid tryptophan             in bacteria is due to the work of this laboratory.  Although many               details of the complex network of regulation controlling tryptophan             synthesis and utlization can now be explained, the problem still                offers many avenues of study that will provide information                      concerning a wide range of fundamental biochemical and genetic                  processes.",
