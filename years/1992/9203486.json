 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a graduate                   student in anthropology, studying the process of national                       identity formation among Bulgarian Turkish citizens who have                    recently emigrated from Bulgaria to Turkey and are being                        assimilated as national Turks.  The student will reside in a                    medium sized city where many Bulgarian Turks have settled.                      Using ethnographic methods of participant observation and                       structured interviews as well as archival research, the student                 will study how the national state has attempted to define the                   \"official\" Turkish national identity, and how Bulgarian Turks                   have responded.  The main question is how peoples of different,                 but historically related ethnicities interact to establish                      relations of dominance or equality.                                                                                                                             This research is timely and important as the world sees the                     intensity rising of ethnic conflict in Eastern Europe.                          Understanding general processes of ethnic relations through                     careful case studies can help us comprehend how states attempt to               establish ethnic dominance, and how subject peoples maintain                    their own precious ethnic independence.",
