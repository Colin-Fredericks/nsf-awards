 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transcriptional activation of genes during the defense response has             been widely establish as a major level of regulation.  However, the             cis-elements and trans-acting factors involved in transcriptional               activation have been characterized for only a few defense genes.                In addition to positive regulation, there is also evidence for                  negative regulation of gene expression during the defense response.             However, only 3 genes whose mRNAs are negatively regulated have                 been cloned and the cis elements and trans factors involved in                  their regulation are completely unknown.  A major overall aim of                this proposal is to identify and compare the mechanisms underlying              the positive and negative regulation of genes involved in the                   defense response.  A second major aim is to elucidate the                       mechanisms for the differential espression of the central                       phenylpropanoid and phytoalexin branch pathway genes.",
