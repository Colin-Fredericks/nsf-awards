This orientation can be conceptualized as                 predispositions along one dimension.  At one end of the                         dimension, some individuals appear to have an enduring                          predisposition toward altruism, kindness, social warmth, and                    cooperativeness.  At the other end, some individuals appear to be               predisposed toward behaviors that have been labeled hostile,                    aggressive, and cold-hearted.  An interlocking program of                       research will examine this individual difference dimension in                   children and adolescents.  Socialization patterns may be                        systematically related to its development.  This research will                  conduct basic foundational work upon which later work can build.                The first part of the research program will focus on reliability                and validity, using computer assessments to obtain self-ratings                 from children and adolescents.  This evidence will be compared                  with adult and peer ratings of the same children for the                        convergence in assessments.  In addition, an observational study                will focus on parental socialization of emotional self-                         regulation.  The research is designed to build basic links from                 personality toward developmental and social psychological                       approaches to social interaction.",
