Eight                          lecture/laboratory courses involving majors and non-majors are                  being affected by the technology.  Basic 13C and 1H one-                        dimensional and two-dimensional (COSY, HETCOR, INADEQUATE) NMR                  techniques are introduced in the sophomore Organic Chemistry                    course using known natural products and the students progress                   to structure elucidation of unknowns in Organic Qualitative                     Analysis.  Equilibrium constants and reaction rates are being                   measured in Physical Chemistry during the junior year.  At the                  senior level students study induction decay in the Molecular                    Structure and Reactivity course and multinuclear NMR                            spectroscopy in both the Advanced Inorganic Chemistry course                    and during participation in Senior Inorganic Chemistry Research                 Projects.  Inorganic Chemistry focusses on molecular structure                  determination of main group and transition metal compounds,                     molecular rearrangements, and electronic structure, while                       projects in Organic Chemistry involve both the kinetics of                      molecular rearrangements of organic compounds and the                           structural elucidation of complex bioactive natural products.",
