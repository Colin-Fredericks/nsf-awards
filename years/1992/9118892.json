 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research planned for this 1 year grant seeks to answer                 three questions using the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia                      smithii.  1) How does the average growth rate (size at adulthood                + days to reach adulthood) of individuals in a population predict               fitness (rc= capacity for increase)?  2) Are growth rate and its                underpinnings of size at the time to adulthood heritable traits;                are these traits independent or interdependent (genetically                     correlated)?  3) Can variation in fitness between nearby and                    distant populations be explained by genes acting independently                  (additively) or is interaction within genes (dominance) and/or                  between genes (epistasis) an important component of genetic                     differentiation of populations?                                                      The ability of mosquito populations to transmit disease                    (their vectorial capacity) depends upon their adult size and                    longevity, traits which should be predictable from growth rate                  and its components.  Answers to the first two questions will then               have application for mosquito control.                                               If, as they suspect, gene interactions are important in                    population differentiation, isolated populations may be harboring               greater genetic variation than is presently appreciated.  Answers               to the third question will then bear on the recovery of rare or                 endangered species that persist only as fragmented populations.",
