Each                   participant will present a plenary session or a contributed                     paper.  The workshop will review the present state-of-the-art                   in the areas of ceramic powder processing by colloids,                          aerosols, combustion and other processes, and will discuss                      critical issues, needs and research opportunities in the                        future.  The strength of the meeting will be its                                interdisciplinary character, with contributions from different                  disciplines and from a large spectrum of industrial processes.                  It is expected that the preparation of this workshop in                         conjunction with the 23rd Annual meeting of the Fine Particle                   Society will enhance the participation of a representative                      group of scientists from the U.S. and abroad.                                   The workshop recommendations and final report will address                      research issues of interest to the scientific community in                      ceramic powder processing.  An assessment of the state-of-the-                  art world wide will be made at the conference.",
