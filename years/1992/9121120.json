 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past few years, the field of low-dimensional topology               has undergone expansion.  The theory has significantly widened in               scope and has made use of more and more diverse techniques.  The                theory has branched out into such varied areas as combinatorial                 group theory, differential geometry, algebraic geometry and                     physics in general, spectral theory, representation theory, gauge               theory, and others.  Moreover, the role of computers in the                     theory of low-dimensional topology has become increasingly                      important.                                                                           This project will support the Conference on Low-Dimensional                Topology to be held in May 1992 at the University of Tennessee,                 Knoxville.  The major areas to be covered in this conference are:               (1) negatively curved groups and actions on R-trees, (2) minimal                surfaces in low-dimensional topology, (3) hyperbolic 3-manifolds                and their representations, (4) combinatorial 3-manifold theory,                 and (5) gauge theoretic aspects of 3-manifolds.  This conference                will be held as part of a special emphasis year in topology being               held at the University of Tennessee during the 1991-92 academic                 year.",
