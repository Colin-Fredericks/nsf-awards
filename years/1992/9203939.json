 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work of three investigators is involved in this project.               L. R. Taylor plans to study induction theory (and applications to               the algebraic K and L theory of finite groups), certain                         cohomological questions about low-dimensional manifolds, the                    modules over the symmetric group given by the cohomology of                     configurations spaces, and the theory of approximate fibrations.                W. G. Dwyer will study the classification of finite loop spaces,                realization problems involving Pi-algebras and unstable algebras                over the Steenrod algebra, homotopical questions related to the                 Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture, and some conceptual properties of               the cotangent complex.  E. B. Williams intends to study a general               framework for computing the homotopy type of spaces of                          homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms of manifolds, and various                    related questions about the linear and Hermitian K-theory of                    discrete rings.                                                                      The details of these three parts vary, but all are concerned               either with reducing geometric information to a subject for                     calculation or to perfecting one of the principal algebraic tools               used for this purpose.  The nature of the geometric information                 involved is the crux of the difficulty.  While questions about                  lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to              be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what are known             as topological properties of geometric objects.  These are                      properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),                      knottedness, having no holes, and so forth.  All systematic study               of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric              objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are              only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of                 differences that can occur, all these have only truly been                      comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of             calculation.",
