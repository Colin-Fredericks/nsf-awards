 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the 2.4 Ma old continental Chinese loess/paleosol sequences             large magnetic susceptibility peaks (in paleosols) and troughs (in              loess) correlate very well with sedimentological, geochemical and               paleotological signatures of climate change, as well as with the                dated global ice volume records ( 18O) from the oceans.  For                    interpreting the finescale   X record in terms of quantitative                  paleoclimatic parameters two models have been proposed in which the             magnetic source is either eolian and of constant grainsize, or                  pedogenic and thus finer-grained in the paleosol.  We have compared             the room temperature rock magnetic properties of a sequence of four             identical paleosol and loess horizons (that last 150ka) from one                arid climate and one humid climate site, equidistant from the                   source of loess.  First, we confirm that recent observations by                 others are correct:  that the magnetic grainsize is finer in the                paleosol layers than in the loess, suggesting a partly pedogenic                origin.  Next, we have extended the magnetic measurements to low                temperatures (to 15K) to obtain semi-quantitative estimates of the              ultrafine fraction and confirmed them by bulk grainsize                         distribution measurements.  Thirdly, using additional data                      (Mossbauer absorption spectra), we have shown that the magnetic                 mineral is not the same:  there is more eolian magnetic (> l um)                and less pedogenic maghemite (~10 nm) in the loess horizons.                    Overall, the humid site does show a higher pedogenic fraction and               a comparison of such paired magnetic depth profiles can separate                the eolian input from the pedogenic production.                                      This is an extended supply in which the average magnetic                   record from two nearby arid climate sites will be compared with the             average of two humid climate sites, to separate the common eolian               record from the regional pedogenic one.  Quantitative estimates of              magnetic mineral composition and grainsize will be obtained from                combined low temperature magnetic and Mossbauer data, and then the              inferred variations in pedogenesis (interpreted as regional                     paleomonsoon strength variations) will be checked for selected                  samples using independent measures of pedogenic alterations.  bulk              grainsize distribution, chemical indices such as (A1 2O3 + Fe2O3)               (Na2O +K22O), FeO/FeO3, CaCo3 content etc., authigenic clay                     mineralogy and SEM textural evidence of pedogenic maturation and                CBD- extracted soluble finegrained iron oxide content.  The results             will be a validation of the magnetic parameters used to measure                 paleoenvironmental changes, as well as the history of global (i.e.,             continental Asian) and regional climate changes in central China.",
