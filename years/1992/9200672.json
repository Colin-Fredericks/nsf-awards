 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor David J. Kaup of                                  Clarkson University to collaborate in nonlinear optics                          research with Dr. Heinz Steudel of the Central                                  Institute of Optics of the Academy of Science of                                Berlin, Germany.  The objectives of their joint                                 research are to develop new solutions and applications                          of integrable systems to nonlinear optics, including                            such phenomena as Stimulated Raman Scattering, Two-                             Photon Propagation, Superfluorescence, Three-Wave                               Interactions and Harmonic Generation.  This modest                              support for Dr. Kaup's visits to Berlin and other                               forms of communication will add impetus to their                                collaboration which has been extremely productive                               recently.                                                                                                                                                       With current technology, it is possible to generate                             coherent pulses whose widths are on the order of, or                            less than, typical relaxation times.  In these cases,                           entirely new coherent phenomena can occur which offer                           the possibility of new technological applications.                              While considerable effort has been devoted to the                               development of relevant mathematical techniques and                             solutions, very little work has been done to explain                            the experimental results.  The collaborating U.S. and                           German scientists in this project have been involved                            for many years in the development of the mathematical                           descriptions of such coherent phenomena.  They now                              propose to develop practical applications from the                              existing theoretical base.",
