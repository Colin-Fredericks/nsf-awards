 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Graduate School at Baylor College              of Medicine (BCM) to establish a Research Experiences for                       Undergraduates SITE.  Ten college undergraduates selected from a                nationwide pool of hundreds of applicants will be exposed to a                  research atmosphere through their participation in a 10 week summer             career development program.  Participants will be selected by a                 committee composed of faculty from each basic science department.               Students will be matched with volunteer faculty mentors and become              functioning members of their laboratories.  The unifying focus of               the REU Site will be cellular signal transduction.  BCM has an                  outstanding reputation in this area of fundamental biological                   research involving a number of basic science departments including              Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Molecular Physiology and Biophysics,                and Neuroscience.  The projects that will be offered will involve               subjects and techniques that will be appropriate for students with              a diversity of interests, backgrounds, and levels of experience.                The faculty of BCM have already gained experience in designing                  undergraduate research projects and interacting with college                    students through participation in a 3 year pilot program.  The                  laboratory oriented aspect of the program will be supplemented by               students' participation in research discussions, seminars, career               development activities and social/cultural activities sponsored                 through the SMART Program by the Graduate School.  NSF sponsored                participants will have the benefit of interacting with other                    undergraduates form throughout the nation who will be supported by              other sources and of entering an established career development                 program that effectively promotes interest in science and prepares              undergraduates to enter research oriented careers.",
