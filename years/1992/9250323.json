 "awd_abstract_narration": "For over 20 years College of the Mainland has been supportive                   of experimentation and innovation in the physics laboratory,                    leading to a wide variety of experiences for students in eight                  physics course offerings ranging from strictly conceptual-based                 courses to calculus-based modern physics, rather than the                       traditional set of experiments.  All courses may be taken in a                  traditional or individualized, self-paced mode.  The laboratory                 is open throughout the day and at least two evenings per week;                  laboratory work is worth 50% of the student grade.For over 30                   years the PI has developed, modified, utilized, built, bought                   and tried out software and hardware from a variety of sources.                  There are now over a 1,000 experiments that students may select                 to meet their laboratory requirement.  This has resulted in a                   tremendous bookkeeping and inventory problem because resources                  are utilized from several areas on campus that do not always                    meet the specific demands of the particular experiment.Support                  has been obtained for updated, uniform, particular hardware and                 software that is being maintained in the Physics Learning                       Center and thus is being made available to more students in an                  immediate teaching environment.  The essential equipment                        consists of eight microcomputers, two laser printers, four CD-                  ROM drives, four Labview 2s, four Universal Lab Interfaces, and                 associated sensors and probes.",
