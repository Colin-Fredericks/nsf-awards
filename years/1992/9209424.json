 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore the application of heterogeneous                 intelligent software composed of expert systems and artificial                  neural networks to manufacturing process planning.  Process                     planning is an important component of the manufacturing life cycle              where product designs are translated to steps and processes for                 manufacturing.  Process planning is critical to the subsequent                  quality of the product, and the unit cost during manufacturing.                 Therefore, it is an important contributor to an organization's                  ability to compete through the cost to manufacture, utility and                 performance of its products.                                                         The project will focus on developing a complete understanding              of process planning and its opportunities for intelligent                       computing.  This includes the many manufacturing operations, how                each applies to each product design feature and the correct                     sequence of operations.  An appreciation for the best                           process/sequence combinations leading to efficiency during the                  manufacturing phase and cost effectiveness on the line is                       fundamental for a final project which applies intelligent computing             in an effective manner.",
