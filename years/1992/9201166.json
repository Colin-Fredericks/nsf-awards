 "awd_abstract_narration": "William Gelbart is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                    and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work in                     statistical mechanical treatment of amphiphiles.  He is                         studying the self-organizing properties and phase                               transitions of amphiphiles in water as a function of                            concentration.  Three areas of new study are identified: a)                     coupling between micellar size/shape and long range order in                    concentrated surfactant in water systems; b) structures and                     flow properties of solutions of flexible micelles; and c)                       statistical mechanics of almost ideal solids under stress.                      Gelbart is using a whole host of analytical methodologies                       including density functional theory, mean field                                 approximation, renormalization group approaches, and spin-                      vector-like Hamiltonian approaches supplemented in a few                        cases with Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations.                      %%%                                                                             Amphiphiles are long chainlike molecules which have water                       soluble polar groups at one end and oily hydrocarbon groups                     at the other end.  Amphiphiles find widespread use as                           surfactants and detergents.  These molecules tend to                            aggregate together in solution and self-organize into layers                    or micelles which are enclosed surfaces having the polar                        groups on the outside, and the long chain oily portions on                      the inside.  Amphiphiles have widespread industrial and                         commercial use.  Gelbart's theoretical research will help us                    to better understand the physical chemistry of this                             important class of chemical compounds, and to design even                       better materials of this type.",
