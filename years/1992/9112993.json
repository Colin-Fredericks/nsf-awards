 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study of the dynamics of local segmental motion in polymers                will include polymer solutions in semi-dilute and concentrated                  regions and in miscible polymer blends.  The techniques to be used              are various types of dynamic light scattering, including photon                 correlation spectroscopy, Brillouin scattering and holographic                  grating relaxation.  Properties such as dynamic longitudinal and                shear compliances, dynamic longitudinal and shear moduli, hyper-                sonic velocity and attenuation coefficient, mutual and tracer                   diffusion coefficients of labeled chains in the semi-dilute or/and              concentrated polymer solutions will be investigated.  The spectrum              will be measured as a function of polymer molecular weight,                     concentration, scattering wavevector, and solvent qualities.                    Efforts will be made to relate the dynamic light scattering to the              mechanical relaxation spectrum of the polymer solution.  Experi-                mental verification of theoretical predictions is part of this                  research.  The kinetics and thermodynamics interaction in miscible              polymer blends will also be investigated by the static and dynamic              light scattering intensity measurements.  By combining the results              of mutual and self-diffusion coefficients of the polymer blend,                 the role of cross velocity correlations between segments of the                 same chain and between neighboring chains will be clarified.  The               mutual diffusion coefficient will be measured by using photon                   correlation spectroscopy, the self diffusion coefficient by pulsed              field gradient NM or by the holographic grating relaxation tech-                nique whenever appropriate.                                                                                                                                     Understanding of the thermodynamic interactions and the dynamics of             local segmental motion is vital to various application of polymers              in diverse areas, such as coatings, electronics, optics, and                    structural materials.",
