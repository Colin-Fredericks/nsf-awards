 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fate of most of Africa's savanna parks is to become                    islands in a sea of humanity.  The effects of park isolation n                  community dynamics will depend fundamentally on the degree to                   which wildlife populations are naturally linked by dispersal and                                                                                                                                                                                gene flow.  I propose to address an issue that will affect the                  future management of the large herbivores that to a great extent                                                                                                                                                                                are characterize and justify these protected areas:  To what                    extent are Africa's savanna parks already conserving naturally                  isolated lineages, and by implication, dynamically independent                  populations?                                                                    Since all parks and species cannot be studied, a framework for                  predicting the gross population structure of a given species is                                                                                                 required.  This is provided by the 'Resource Use Hypothesis'                    (RUH) which states that vegetation and geographic discontinuities                                                                                                                                                                               form barriers to gene flow for species that are habitat                         'specialists', but not for species that are habitat                             'generalists'.  While ecological and macroevolutionary evidence                                                                                                 supports the RUH, the microevolutionary component of the                        hypothesis has not been examined.  The RUH will be tested by                    examining the population structure of six large herbivore species                                                                                                                                                                               (elephant, buffalo, impala, zebra, giraffe, and wildebeest) that                                                                                                                                                                                are common to three savanna parks in Tanzania (Serengeti and                    Tarangire) and Botswana (Chobe).  These species were chosen                     because they have strongly contrasting food and habitat                         preferences.  These savanna parks were chosen because they have                                                                                                 similar large mammal communities and, most important, because                   their geographical attributes create an ideal setting to test the                                                                                                                                                                               RUH.  If the RUh is supported it will provide a mechanistic model                                                                                                                                                                               for prediction the population structure of species with known                   habitat requirements within a region of known habitat                           characteristics.",
