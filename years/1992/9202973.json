The research will address the problem of formation                  of thin films of compound materials by chemical vapor                           deposition (CVD) from organometallic precursors. The intent is                  to correlate the basic gas phase and surface chemical behavior                  of the precursors with the structure and purity of the                          resulting films, and with the efficiency of precursor                           conversion to final product. The system to be investigated is                   the production of AlN films from organoaluminum-ammonia or                      -amide precursors containing aluminum and nitrogen in the                       correct stoichiometric ratio. The gas phase and surface                         chemistry of these precursors will be studied using a                           combination of mass spectrometry with time-of-flight                            measurements of product species, and pulsed beam Fourier                        transform microwave spectroscopy.  Thin film deposition will be                 carried out in a cold-wall, hot-stage CVD system.  Films formed                 in this system and in the course of the surface chemistry                       studies will be characterized by a range of surface and                         analytical techniques to determine their composition, structure                 and orientational relationships.                                                %%%                                                                             This study will provide a comprehensive picture of the steps                    leading from precursor to film in AlN deposition, and in the                    process identify the critical reaction steps controlling                        composition and structure. This information can also be used in                 the design of improved precursor systems for AlN as well as                     serving as a paradigm for the CVD of other electronic and                       ceramic systems.",
