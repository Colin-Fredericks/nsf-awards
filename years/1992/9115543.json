 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most invertebrate phyla contain species which include a larval                  phase in their life cycle. In certain instances, however, there                 has been a tendancy to modify or eliminate the larval phase.                    Little is known about how modifications in development arise                    during evolutoin. In this proposal, a model system is developed                 and exploited to study the mechanisms underlying evolutionary                   changes in development. This model system consists of two closely               related species of ascidians that exhibit different larval forms                and are capable of interspecific hybridizatrion. Molgula oculata                (the urodele species) develops a conventional tailed (or urodele)               larva, which contains brain pigment cells, a notochord, and tail                muscle cells. In contrast, Molgula occulta (the anural species)                 develops a tailless (or anural) larva, which lacks brain pigment                cells, a notochord, and differentiated muscle cells. Hybrids                    produced by fertilizing eggs of the anural speies with sperm of                 the urodele species develop a brain pigment cell and notochrod                  but do not form differentiated muscle cells, suggesting that both               maternal and zygotic changes have occured during the evolution of               anural development. This proposal combines embryological and                    molecular approaches 1) to characterize the maternal and zygotic                changes involved in the switch from urodele to anural larval                    development, 2) to examine the molecular mechanisms responsible                 for lack of muscle cell differentiation in the anural species and               3) to determine the phylogenetic realtionship of anural and                     urodele ascidians. The results are expected to provide a more                   comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underying                         evolutionary changes in development.",
