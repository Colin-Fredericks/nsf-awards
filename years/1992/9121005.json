 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major theme of twentieth century mathematics has been the                deep connections between group theory and geometry and topology.                This connection began with Poincare's discovery of the notion of                the fundamental group of a space.  One of the most interesting                  aspects of this connection is the relationship between group                    theory and curvature in particular, nonpositive curvature.  The                 1980's saw a new influx of ideas in this last area including the                following:  (1) work on \"word hyperbolic groups,\" that is, a                    class which contains all groups which can act properly and                      cocompactly on negatively curved spaces, (2) the recognition of                 the algorithmic character of such groups leading to the                         introduction of the notion of \"automatic groups,\" (3) the study                 of groups acting on trees and R-trees, (4) work on polyhedra and                orbihedra of nonpositive curvature and applications to complexes                of groups, and (5) the Novikov conjecture for word hyperbolic                   groups and work on topological rigidity of nonpositively curved                 manifolds.                                                                           This project will support a research quarter in Nonpositive                Curvature and Geometric Group Theory to be held at the Ohio State               University during the Spring Quarter of 1992.  The activity will                include both long and short term visitors, as well as a                         conference which will be held during the first week of June 1992.",
