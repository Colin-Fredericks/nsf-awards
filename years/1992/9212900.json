The equipment will be used for                                    several research projects, including in                                         particular: the NSF sponsored project                                           \"Microdynamics and Nanodynamics: Materials                                      Structure and Devices:  the Semiconductor                                       Research Corporation project, \"Massively                                        Parallel Electron Beam Architecture for                                         Electron Beam Lithography; and a DARPA                                          sponsored project (with Raytheon) on RF                                         Vacuum Microelectronics.  All these projects                                    use 20 nm diameter silicon tips or arrays of                                    silicon tips to produce tunneling microscope                                    devices or to produce field emitter arrays for                                  electron beam instrumentation, or vacuum                                        microelectronic devices.  We have designed a                                    unique nanoelectromechanical instrument:  a                                     high-speed (5 MHz) scanning tunneling device                                    to be used to make unique sensors to detect                                     sound, radiation, mass, pressure, and                                           acceleration.                                                                                                                                                   The Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)                                         equipment and software requested in this                                        proposal will be used to drive our                                              nanoelectromechanical tunneling devices and                                     to characterize the tip formation processed for                                 both silicon field and tunneling tip structures.",
