 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of being able to decompose a large-scale                    engineering system into smaller subsystems which may be designed                independently (yet concurrently) and integrated into a whole cannot             be overemphasized.  Many algorithms for the analysis of decomposed              systems require that all variables, constraints, objectives and                 linkages between subsystems be precisely identified and rigorously              specified.  In practice, this extremely rigorous definition of the              system and subsystems is often unattainable.                                         The objective of this research is to develop a method of                   system analysis and synthesis based on the principles embodied in               fuzzy set theory; a mathematical approach that has been developed               to model imprecision rigorously. Specifically, the mathematics of               fuzzy set theory will be incorporated into methods for hierarchical             and non-hierarchical decomposition and resynthesis of problems.                 The resulting procedures will be integrated to provide a powerful               tool for effecting the design of complex engineering systems                    through hierarchic and/or non-hierarchic decomposition in a fuzzy               design environment.",
