The objectives are:  1) promote student growth in                 competence, confidence, and self-esteem by managing a research                  project; 2) enhance student written and oral communication skills               through research presentations; 3) interest students in research                careers and graduate study by having them join working research                 groups in agricultural or food engineering.  After selecting a                  topic area, each participant will join a research group and be                  assisted by faculty in defining a research problem.  The student                will define the problem in a proposal, carry out a project, and                 present results orally and in a written report.  The student will               refine the report and enter it in one or more undergraduate student             paper competitions.  Suitable papers will be published in refereed              journals.",
