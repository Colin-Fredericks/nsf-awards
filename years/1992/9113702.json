 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Phase II proposal is to explore                           the development of a new, low-cost, high-reliability,                           high-definition prototype three-color projection                                display system.  The proposed Membrane Projection                               Display (MPD) system consists of three electron-                                beam-addressed Membrane Light Modulators (e-                                    MLMs) that are read out in reflection with the red,                             green, and blue components of a single high-                                    brightness lamp.  The e-MLM makes use of Optron's                               proprietary high-density, multi-conductor Charge                                Transfer Plate (CTP) which acts as a supporting                                 substrate for the membrane.  The CTP, which                                     consists of a dense array of longitudinally-oriented                            conducting pins embedded in a wafer of insulating                               material, enables the electron-gun-deposited charge                             distribution to electrostatically deform the highly                             reflective metallized membrane which is stretched                               over wells etched into the CTP.  Schlieren filtering of                         the light reflected from the three e-MLMs yields an                             intense, high-contrast-ratio image that is projected                            with an achromatic imaging system onto a high-gain                              screen.  High brightness and multi-color image                                  registration are achieved by use of the zero-order                              readout beams.  The e-MLM offers flickerless                                    operation, is computer controlled, and offers the                               possibility of mixing different display formats (e.g.,                          graphics, text, standard video images) on the same                              screen simultaneously, and in real-time.  The MPD                               system to be developed in this program will have a                              75-mm diameter active area that will contain 1,000 x                            1,000 pixels, offer 60Hz framing rate, and projection                           into a 40o field of view with 2000 lumens at the                                screen.",
