 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a renewed investigation of the trace constituents in arctic             aerosols, using the Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA)             technique.  The technique is extremely sensitive and powerful,                  capable of determining the concentration of about forty elements,               including many environmentally crucial ones such as aluminum, zinc,             arsenic and antimony that are present in very low concentrations.               As a first priority, this study will complete the analysis of                   filtered samples obtained by the Atmospheric Environment Services               of Canada on Ellesmere Island since 1980, and secondarily will                  analyze samples obtained at Mould Bay and Igloolik during the                   winter/spring transition.                                                                                                                                       The occurrence of arctic haze, the general term for aerosol                     concentrations in the lower troposphere, reaches a seasonal maximum             in late winter when it becomes widespread through the arctic.  The              variation is the result both of seasonal differences in the                     northward transport, and in the removal process through wet and dry             deposition.  Multivariate factor analysis, potential source                     contribution functions, and time series analyses, combined with air             mass trajectories will provide advective patterns that will refine              our understanding of the transport mechanism and atmospheric                    pathways from the source regions to the Canadian Arctic, and allow              the investigations of trends in the relative composition of the                 arctic aerosol trace constituents.",
