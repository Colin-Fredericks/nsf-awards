 "awd_abstract_narration": "This four year project will provide 685 middle school and                       high school mathematics teachers in four counties in South                      Carolina with seminars by nationally known speakers,                            inservice workshops, and academic year short courses. In                        addition, a three year series of intensive five week summer                     institutes will be offered for 48 leader teachers.  The                         seminar series and workshops are designed to build support                      among the teachers and in the community for excellence in                       mathematics and to enhance administrative awareness and                         support for the efforts.  The project is designed to                            determine effective strategies for developing teacher                           understanding mathematics, teacher and student abilities to                     communicate mathematics, and to involve students in the                         discovery of mathematics.  Course materials will be developed                   to aid in implementation of exemplary classroom teaching                        practices.",
