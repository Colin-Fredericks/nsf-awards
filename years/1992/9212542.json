 "awd_abstract_narration": "Narrow dietary specialization in phytophagous insects has been                  hypothesized to evolve as a response to hostplant allelochemistry               for nearly three decades, but recent investigations have questioned             this hypothesis.  Genetic studies, in particular, have failed to                support the notion of trade-offs in insect performance across plant             species upon which the theory is based.  While ecological studies               which take into account three trophic levels have supported the                 hypothesis that predators may be a strong selective agent on insect             host range, there are currently no genetic studies of hostplant-                mediated predation.  The research proposed here uses an adapted                 specialist lepidopteran herbivore, Junonia coenia, which recycles               plant allelochemicals as a defense against predators to assess: 1)              the responses of invertebrate predators to intraspecific variation              in levels of sequestered allelochemicals, 2) the genetic basis of               allelochemical tolerance and sequestration, 3) the genetic                      relationship of oviposition preferences with physiological                      adaptation and protection from predation, and 4) the interaction of             adaptation to hostplant chemistry and the plant's chemical defence.             By combining field studies of predation with quantitative genetic               analyses of adaption to phytochemistry and predators, this study                will integrate these seemingly contradictory single-factor                      hypotheses.  A practical result will be a greater understanding of              the biology of plant pests.",
