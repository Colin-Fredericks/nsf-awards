 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to complete the research for a                   book to explore the interaction of the ideology of human                        perfectability and reproductive science and technology.  The                    author argues that, in the wake of the new sciences and                         technologies of reproduction, standards are being set for the                   \"perfect child,\" echoing an older ideal, the \"perfect man.\"  The                book examines trends, counter-trends and alternatives to                        pressures for a new health hierarchy of birth.  This grant will                 enable the investigator to study works in feminist and postmodern               philosophy that provide a way of examining the idea of human                    perfectibility and reproductive science and technology within a                 network of intersecting, unequal power relationships.  Drawing                  especially on feminist interpretations of the European                          philosopher Michel Foucault, the investigator finds a framework                 for illustrating how perfectibility standards are emerging, not                 through grand design, but through the intersection of the                       discourses and practices of differently situated groups:  through               medical professionals, parents, researchers, set against                        persisting negative attitudes toward people with disabilities.                  Feminist postmodernism provides a way of heeding counter-voices                 from genetic support groups, concerned medical personnel, parents               of affected children -- of linking them together and thus of                    offering alternative directions for reporductive science and                    technology and for framing procreative values and norms.",
