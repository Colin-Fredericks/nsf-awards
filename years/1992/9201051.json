Stanley of the Chemistry Department, Louisiana                    State University at Baton Rouge.  Bimetallic rhodium complexes                  of binucleating linear tetra(tertiaryphosphine) ligands have                    been prepared and used as selective catalysts for                               hydroformylation reactions.  The catalysts become inactive if                   the rhodium centers are separated by long ligand chains,                        suggesting that bimetallic cooperativity is an important factor                 in their activity.  Stanley will study the mechanism and                        kinetics of this reaction in order to understand the exact                      nature of the bimetallic cooperativity step.  In addition, the                  effectiveness of complexes containing other metals and mixed                    metals will be tested and the suitability of the system for                     asymmetric catalytic reactions will be explored.                                &&Hydroformylation is the chemical process of converting alkenes                into aldehydes, using hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide as the                   other reactants.  The process is widely used commercially to                    produce aldehydes as well as alcohols.  Stanley will study the                  reactions of new catalyts for this reaction with the goals of                   understanding the details of the reaction mechanism and of                      testing catalysts which can favor the production of specific                    products.",
