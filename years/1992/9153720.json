 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) AMP proposal seeks                funds to support the creation of an alliance between eight                      historically black colleges and universities (Tougaloo College,                 Miles College, Alabama A&M University, Oakwood College, Talladega               College, Stillman, Alabama State University, and Tuskegee                       University) in the \"Deep South\" with UAB serving as the lead                    university.  Alabama A&M is the only institution listed other than              UAB that offers a doctorate degree in an NSF fundable academic                  area.  The UAB AMP also has considerable business support with the              Coca-Cola Foundation, Rust International Corporation, Minnesota                 Mining and Manufacturing Company already on board.                                                                                                              The fundamental goal of the proposed alliance is to increase                    significantly the number of minority scholars that complete the                 B.S. degree in NS&E areas.  The UAB AMP Program will attempt to                 increase the number of science and/or engineering students on the               nine campus alliance by using a comprehensive and longitudinal                  approach involving thirteen programs that focus at different points             along the \"academic pipeline\".  The P.I. is requesting support for              five of these programs.  Many of the other programs are currently               supported by off campus sources ( including businesses, Federal                 government, local sources) or from UAB.  The five programs to be                supported in part from NSF are:                                                                                                                                 o    AMP Scholars,                                                              o    Summer Research Internship Program,                                        o    Science and Engineering Drop-in Centers,                                   o    High School and College Science Campus, and                                o    Instructional Enhancement Program.                                                                                                                         UAB AMP will couple these five programs with the existing programs.                                                                                             The P.I. presented a unique diagram tying together all the                      elements in the UAB AMP pipeline programs.  The complete list                   follows:                                                                                                                                                        o    The Titusville 200:  Partnership for excellence program,                   o    Grade School and Middle School Science Camp,                               o    Pre-college Summer Research Internships,                                   o    High School Summer Research Internships,                                   o    HBCU Summer Research Internships,                                          o    College Summer Research Internships,                                       o    Undergraduate Scholarship,                                                 o    AMP Scholars,                                                              o    Science and Engineering Drop-in Centers,                                   o    High School and College Science Camp,                                      o    Instructional Enhancement Program,                                         o    Graduate Fellowships,                                                      o    Postdoctoral and Visiting Faculty Fellowships, and                         o    Faculty Recruitment, and Faculty Retention activities.                                                                                                     The UAB AMP programs are located in a region with a high minority               population; the potential impact of this alliance is significant.",
