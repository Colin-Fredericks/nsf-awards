 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues observations of an unexpectedly \"strong\"                 1992 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event on corals and coral              reef ecosystems of the eastern Pacific Ocean.  Dr. Glynn is                     presently completing a 10 year monitoring program on the recovery               processes of coral reef ecosystems from previous ENSO events, which             were classified as \"very strong\" and \"weak\".  It now appears as                 this project is approaching completion, that a \"strong\" ENSO event              is in full swing and that the warming of surface waters is being                felt by several coral reef ecosystems in the eastern Pacific                    region.  Based on biological samples (corals) collected early this              year from sites off Panama, Costa Rica and the Galapagos Islands,               it appears that corals are once again experiencing loss of pigments             and zooxanthellae, termed \"coral bleaching\".  The project will                  obtain real-time responses of coral reef organisms to a \"strong\" El             Nino disturbance, which will be useful for comparison with past                 \"very strong\" and \"weak\" warming events in the eastern Pacific                  Ocean.",
