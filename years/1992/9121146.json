 "awd_abstract_narration": "The neuron, the single brain cell which is the basic unit of the                brain, was discovered 100 years ago.  It is now estimated that                  there are a trillion cells in the brain which are interconnected by             a vast and complex system.  Communication between any two neurons               involves the release of chemical neurotransmitters at the synapse,              or area of contact.  Dr. Lloyd's research is directed towards                   understanding the mechanisms underlying the modulation of synaptic              transmission.  While it was once readily accepted that an                       individual neuron only contained one specific neurotransmitter, it              is now clear that a neuron may have multiple transmitters as well               as other chemicals, such as peptides, that have modulatory action.              Dr. Lloyd has identified motor neurons in which conventional                    neurotransmitters are co-localized with neuropeptides.  He will now             use a combination of state-of-the-art biochemical and                           neurophysiological techniques to examine how peptides are released              from these neurons and their interaction with conventional                      neurotransmitters at pre-and post synaptic sites.  The results from             these studies will lead to new insights into the crucial role that              neurotransmitters play in the functioning of the brain.  Moreover,              given that alternation in neurotransmitters are implicated in a                 number of neurological disorders, these studies may be of potential             importance for the development of treatments to alleviate these                 diseases.",
