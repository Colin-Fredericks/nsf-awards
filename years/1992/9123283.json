 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in                  galactic astronomy between Paul W. Hodge of the University of                   Washington and Harvey MacGillivray of the Royal Observatory in                  Edinburgh, United Kingdom.  The objective of the research is to                 search for and identify and characterize star clusters in the                   Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud using unique                        instrumentation at the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh.  Dr. Hodge               brings to this collaboration his extensive knowledge about the                  cluster system and stellar content of the Magellanic Clouds and                 other local galaxies.  He has some of the best 4-meter telescope                plates of the Magellanic Clouds.  This is complemented by Dr.                   MacGillvray's extensive experience in image analysis and access to              the Royal Observatory's COSMOS instrument which is considered                   to be the finest plate-scanning instrument and software in the                  world.  The COSMOS machine will be used to scan the 4-meter                     telescope plates in order to eventually obtain a complete map of the            Magellanic Clouds' clusters.                                                                                                                                    The Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud are very useful                 objects for the general study of clusters, their evolution and                  formation, and for understanding the history of these two galaxies.             The results of this research will provide astronomers with new                  clusters to study.  It will also advance understanding of the                   evolution of galaxies in general.",
