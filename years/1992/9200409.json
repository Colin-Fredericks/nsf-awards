 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experiences for Undergraduates site involving six               students will be supported by this award.  Their work will focus                on carefully selected problems in applied probability.  Students                will be expected to combine collaborative and individual efforts                in their research.  At the end of the summer, the group will                    travel to a professional meeting such as the Institute for                      Mathematical Statistics/American Statistical Association joint                  meetings.  Students are expected to prepare written reports                     summarizing their work, many of which should lead to publishable                papers.  They will be encouraged to present their findings either               at meetings or at their home institutions.                                           The theme of the research is that of discrete probability                  structures such as occurrence patterns and runs, competition                    models or occupancy problems.  Principal focus will be on the                   application of the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation,                  but students will also consider Gaussian limits and other non-                  Poisson approximations.",
