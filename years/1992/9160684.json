The eventual                                   application of this work will be in the                                         design of orthopedic implants with a range of                                   surface geometries which will facilitate the                                    desired cellular response on the various                                        regions of the device.  The design of three                                     types of surfaces will be investigated;                                         namely, 1) one that promotes bone growth and                                    inhibits soft tissue growth, 2) one that                                        allows soft tissue growth but not bone                                          growth, and 3) one that acts as a barrier to                                    fibrous tissue growth.  The cellular response                                   to sputter coated Ti surfaces which have                                        various dimensions of square wave                                               microgeometries will be compared to a flat                                      surface.  If the square wave shape does not                                     produce the desired cellular responses, a                                       cusp shaped microgeometry will be evaluated.                                    Two cellular lines will be tested - rat                                         tendon fibroblasts and rat bone marrow cells.                                                                                                                   Phase II of the research will concentrate on                                    the design and in vivo testing of orthopedic                                    implants with the appropriate microgeometries                                   strategically placed on the implant to obtain                                   the desired cellular responses.",
