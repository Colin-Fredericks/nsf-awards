 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data from the developing world show a strong correlation                   between female household headship and poverty, due largely to the               status of women in society.  Household members suffer the direct                effects of poverty such as malnourishment, disease, and violence,               and they are often forced to trade off schooling for work.  On                  the other hand, research in the peripheral countries shows a                    greater devotion of women's income to household needs, a more                   egalitarian distribution of domestic chores, and a less violent                 domestic environment.  This has opened up to debate the issue of                the effect of female headship on women's and household poverty.                 This project will involve comparative research on the link                      between women and poverty in two Mexican cities.  It will examine               the circumstances under which female headship arises and the                    mechanisms by which these households fall into or break out of                  poverty.  Data will be collected for both female and non-female                 headed households in two different urban cultural environments.                 Both structured and unstructured interviews as well as                          ethnographic data on labor and household histories will form the                basis for the analysis.  Analysis will be performed with special                software designed for exploring patterns and themes in                          ethnographic data.                                                                   Results of this research will add new knowledge on the                     relationship between household structure and poverty in                         developing countries.  It will provide important insights into                  the position of women in society, the labor market, and the home.               It will also fill in important gaps in knowledge about female                   headed households in Latin America, an area of rapid demographic                and social change.",
