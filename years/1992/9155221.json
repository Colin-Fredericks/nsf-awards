 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Robert Yager of the University of Iowa has developed a                      teacher enhancement program (\"Iowa Chautauqua\") for middle                      school teachers across the state.  This program provides                        teachers with a three-week workshop experience in the                           Science-Technology-Society (STS) approach to science                            instruction. The STS approach stresses the societal impacts                     and issues of natural, technological, and anthropocentric                       activities.  Examples of STS issues would include drought,                      agriculture, hydroelectric power generation.  Teachers will                     have instruction on how to identify STS issues that are                         local concerns and are likely to engage students in                             meaningful inquiry.  Teachers will develop the ability to                       enable student investigations by facilitating data                              gathering, analysis, and design of alternative social                           action.  These social actions can be pursued as                                 out-of-school efforts to address real community issues.                                                                                                         The Iowa Chautauqua will reach 300 Iowa middle school                           science teachers in ten different areas during a two year                       period.  Scientists from industry and from science faculty                      at Iowa universities and community colleges are involved as                     science resources.  Dr. Yager's project leadership team has                     assembled an impressive array of information sources from                       which students and teachers may derive data for their                           investigations.  This teacher enhancement project will help                     teachers and students to develop as independent                                 investigators with an awareness of the relationships between                    science and society.                                                                                                                                            Cost sharing on this project represents 53% of the NSF                          contribution.",
