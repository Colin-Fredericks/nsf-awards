 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides undergraduate aerospace engineering                       students in design courses the means rapidly to manufacture                     accurate prototypes or scale models of parts they have                          designed, without recourse to skilled labor and well within the                 time constraints of a one semester course.  To do so, the                       University employs an apparatus (Stereolithographic press )                     which can use a CAD solid modeler database, already generated                   by students in the process of finalizing their designs, to                      produce prototypes as three-dimensional plastic solids.  Three-                 dimensional printing (stereolithography) is safe, dependable,                   state-of-the-art technology, well beyond the development stage,                 and already coming into wide use in industry.  This project                     represents a pioneering  use of this new technology, embodied                   in a commercially available apparatus, as a tool to bring the                   issue of producibility into the educational experience of                       engineering graduates.  The project is significant because it                   addresses the urgent national need to strengthen the design and                 manufacturing content of undergraduate engineering curricula                    while providing the crucial linkage between those two important                 aspects of production.",
