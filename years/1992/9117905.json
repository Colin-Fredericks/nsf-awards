 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work will investigate the sequences, rates,                   timing, and environmental controls of diagenetic changes in two                 types of mineral controlled alteration:  1.  Preneomorphic                      mineralogical and compositional changes in biogenic aragonites, 2.              The stabilization of biogenic high Mg calcites to low Mg calcites.              Materials for the work will be obtained from San Salvador Island,               the Bahamas, where Holocene and Pleistocene sediments of reef,                  shallow subtidal, tidal delta, lagoonal, beach and dune facies                  exist in close proximity to modern analogs occupied by the same                 genera and species of organisms.  Prior and ongoing work by others              on the stratigraphy and depositional and diagenetic histories of                these sediments, and age dates determined by a variety of                       techniques, provide and excellent framework for the proposed study.             Tools (reflectance and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and             techniques are now available for non-destructive characterization               of H20-, OH- and organic-containing phase in skeletons.  Because                abundances of these unstable phases in skeletons are taxonomically              controlled, work will focus on a small number of important                      sediment-producing taxa.  Comparisons of modern skeletons with                  suites of fossil skeletal material of the same genera and species               whose ages and diagenetic histories are well-known, and whose                   mineralogy, chemical composition, and micro- and ultrastructure are             thoroughly characterized will clarify the roles of several                      important mineral and compositional phases in the early diagenetic              alteration carbonate skeletons.",
