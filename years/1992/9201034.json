 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central goal of this interdisciplinary, continuing                     project is to develop fundamental understanding of phenomena                    involving the slow flow of dry granular materials.  Part I of the               research, the first of two parts, focuses on a biaxial                          constitutive test with two additional, innovative, features: (i)                the capacity to continuously measure the speed of sound in                      deforming granular material as a function of the accummulated                   deformation in the sample and the direction of propagation of the               waves and (ii) the capacity of continuously measure density                     changes and particle velocities with sophisticated X-ray imaging                equipment.  The goals of Part I include (i) experimentally, to                  construct and operate the apparatus and (ii) computationally, to                simulate deformation of a sample in the apparatus, including                    superimposed acoustic waves, up to and beyond the formation of                  shear bands.  Mathematical analysis has a major supporting role                 to play in extracting constitutive information from the                         experimental data and in developing an appropriate numerical                    scheme.                                                                              Part II of the research consists of several subprojects                    which probe more deeply phenomena discovered in the previous                    grant period.  These include (i) to study the flutter instability               as a possible cause of vibrations in silos, (ii) to further                     investigate experimentally and to understand analytically                       porosity waves in a discharging silo, (iii) to characterize more                fully and to explain the power spectra of time-dependent stresses               in a discharging silo, and (iv) to explore \"scale-invariant\"                    initial value problems as a possible paradigm problem in                        elastoplasticity (analogous to the Riemann problem in gas                       dynamics).                                                                           Regarding applications, this project has been most closely                 associated with the flow of granular materials inside silos.                    However, there are many geophysical occurrences of granular                     materials, and the rich supply of constitutive information on                   sound propagatioyn to be gathered from this project will be                     relevant for these.  Moreover, the simulation of shear banding                  has implications far beyond this project - mathematically because               shear banding involves PDE which change type and scientifically                 because shear banding is a widespread mechanism leading to                      failure in many materials.",
