 "awd_abstract_narration": "A core Facility for intensive computer and molecular graphics is                proposed for the recently expanded research initiative in                       Molecular Biophysics at Washington University School of Medicine.               This expansion during the past two years had included:  (a)                     recruitment of six new faculty whose research is on molecular                   biophysics of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, (b)                          construction of new faculty research laboratories, a new NMR                    facility and an x-ray structure facility.                                                                                                                       The requested instrumentation is a cluster of minisupercomputer                 workstations and associated peripherals that will provide optimum               cost/performance characteristics for both the compute-intensive                 and molecular graphics needs of the biophysics group comprised of               the new and previously-present faculty plus one or two additional               projected recruitments (8-10 laboratories total).  Research                     projects that will be critically dependent on the new                           Computational Core facility include:  (a) crystallographic                      refinement on a number of protein structures being solved with                  use of the current Xuong-Hamlin area detector, (b) distance                     geometry and simulated annealing analysis of NMR data for                       protein, nucleic acid and lipid system, (c) computational                       modeling of structural and thermodynamic properties of proteins                 and the development of improved macromolecular potential energy                 functions, and (d) modeling and analysis of the dynamics,                       energetics and linkages in large systems of macromolecules,                     including blood-clotting cascades, protein-DNA complexes and                    cytoskeletal systems.",
