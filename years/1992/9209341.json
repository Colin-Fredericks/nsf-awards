The primary                                                   objective of this research                                                      initiation project (RIA) is to                                                  formulate physically accurate                                                   semiconductor transport models                                                  which are suitable of the efficient                                             numerical computation and develop                                               paralledl algorithms for the                                                    evaluation of the electron                                                      distribution function.  The novel                                               aspect of the the work is to                                                    describe the motion of electrons in                                             a semiconductor by stochastic                                                   differential equations.

Specifically, transport models will                                             be fornulated by approximating                                                  discontinous random scattering                                                  processes with continous random                                                 processes; develop parallel                                                     numerical algorithms for the                                                    efficient solution of such                                                      transport equations; simulate                                                   MOSFET devices by solving the                                                   transport equations self-                                                       consistently with the Poisson                                                   equation; analyze the asymptotic                                                behavior in energy of the electron                                              distribution function, etc.                                                     The impact of this research is                                                  twofold.  First, it will introduce                                              a novel approach to the                                                         developement of semiconductor                                                   transport models based on the                                                   theory of stochastic differential                                               equations.  Second, the new                                                     numerical techniques will lead to                                               powerful CAD tools for                                                          comprehensive semiconductor device                                              analysis.//",
