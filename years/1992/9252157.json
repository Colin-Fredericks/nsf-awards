 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate education in fluid dynamics can be greatly                        improved if analytical descriptions are complemented by the                     experience of visualizing and controlling the dynamic behavior                  of real flow fields. This project employs modern                                multidimensional flow diagnostics and digital image processing,                 powerful and convenient educational tools, which take the                       student far beyond the usual scope of laboratory courses.  The                  student can see unsteady flows around complex configurations.                   These techniques are incorporated into assignments in a                         required first course in fluid mechanics.  A junior-level                       laboratory employs flow visualization from both the Eulerian                    and Lagrangian viewpoints.  Senior-level elective courses teach                 advanced flow diagnostics and flow control techniques, while                    Special Problem courses facilitate individual undergraduate                     research projects in these areas.  Argonion laser beams are                     expanded into sheets, with an acousto-optic beam modulator for                  fast, controlled strobing.  A laser schlieren system                            illuminates density variations.  Images will be captured                        through fast-shuttered CCD-array videocameras and analyzed                      using computer workstations.  Planar velocimetry and vortex and                 shock tracking are used for analysis of the spatial and                         temporal evolution of flows.  These will be used along with                     existing flow facilities and single-point quantitative                          diagnostics, to study flow control.  The project makes possible                 the incorporation of modern unsteady fluid mechanics into the                   undergraduate curriculum.",
