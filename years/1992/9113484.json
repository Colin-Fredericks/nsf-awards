 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Mark A. Ratner is supported by a grant from the                       Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study an                     extension of the static and dynamic self-consistent field                       technique.  Proposed development research includes the                          generalizaiton of static mean field techniques to work in                       optimized general coordinates, the use of specific correlation                  factors to surmount problems caused by static correlations, and                 the use of Fourier methods in time and space to increase the                    efficiency of mean field calculations.  Applications research                   will include lifetime studies of weakly interacting molecular                   clusters using both static and dynamic methods, perturbative                    studies of weakly bound molecules, work on lineshapes in metal                  clusters, and time dependent dynamics in electron transfer                      systems.                                                                        %%%                                                                             Recent elegant laser spectroscopic advances in the field of                     chemistry have greatly increased our knowledge of the rates,                    mechanisms, and the product distributions in gas phase chemical                 reactions.  These advances have placed new demands upon the                     theorist to develop, implement, and utilize theoretical tools                   capable of describing the results of such experiments, and to                   predict the behavior of reactions under differing conditions.                   The mean field approximation used by Professor Ratner is one                    successful theoretical approach to dealing with the quantum                     many body problems of this type.",
