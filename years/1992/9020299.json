 "awd_abstract_narration": "The High Pressure Rapid Freezer (HPRF) will be used to freeze                   samples of relatively large dimensions without the formation of                 large ice crystals, making it feasible to study complex cellular                systems, tissues, using rapid cryofixation.  This opens new                     frontiers in the exploration of rapidly fixed eukaryotic                        organisms.  Coupled with freeze substitution, rapid freezing will               allow study of labile structures, short lived events, and other                 advances over conventional preparations already shown when single               cell suspensions have been studied using this approach.  Projects               will use the superior characteristics of freeze substituted                     tissues prepared with the HPRF to investigate short lived events                (neural tissue alterations due to ion concentrations, secretion                 in salivary glands of ticks, secretion of calcium in plant                      cells), labile structures (oocyte cytoskeleton, cotton fiber                    cytoskeleton), osmotic-sensitive structures (mitochondria in                    chemotherapy, symbiotic interfaces), immunolocalization of                      various antigens (cytskeleton, cytokinin, anticancer agents), and               symbiology between dinoflagellates and sea anemone, and plants                  and nitrogen-fixing bacteria.  The project involves research in                 several regional institutions, and will examine plant, animal,                  and microbial systems that have been recalcitrant to                            cryopreservation using previously available equipment.  The                     instrument will be the only one in the southeastern United                      States, and would be made available to qualified regional users.",
