 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although post-communist countries vary in their approaches to                   economic reform, many share a common complaint:  the opposition of              sizeable groups in society to the basic values of a market economy.             Particularly in the Commonwealth of Independent States and the                  Baltics, pro-and anti-market leaders alike have noted what they see             as deep-seated public resistance to private property, market                    prices, and substantial inequality.  Cultural traditions and                    socialist values appear to have reinforced a public taste for a                 strong but benevolent welfare state, from early Tsarist times to                the post-Soviet era.                                                                                                                                            An adverse public reaction could surely undermine the transition to             a free market economy.  Not only is there a threat of outright                  resistance; reforms may simply be subverted by a resentful                      citizenry.  As some experiments with privatization elsewhere                    reveal, lack of public backing can breed chronic dissatisfaction or             simple disengagement.  And as the reluctance of post-Communist                  leaders demonstrates, fear of adverse public reaction influences                both the content and the sequencing of reforms.  The problem is all             the more challenging where economic restructuring is accompanied by             political liberalization.  Society is \"empowered\" just at the time              when many of its most cherished values, and its accustomed economic             security, are under attack by political leaders.                                                                                                                This situation leads to examining the extent to which there is in               fact resistance to the elements of a free market economy, such as               private enterprise, deregulation, and inequality of outcomes.  The              current project is designed to gauge the extent and nature of                   public resistance to a market economy, and to explain its sources.              It is also designed to address several other issues, some                       substantive (such as the relationship between cultural values,                  support for economic reform, and democratic attitudes); and some                methodological (such as the consistency and reliability of survey               data from former Soviet republics).  The research explores public               attitudes toward economic reform in four republics of the former                Soviet Union.  Based on a survey in Russia, Armenia, Lithuania and              Estonia the investigator examines support for, and opposition to,               different elements of a market economy, and the core values that                shape public views.  The research should help to inform the debate              both in the West and in the former republics over the prospects for             a post-Soviet market economy.",
