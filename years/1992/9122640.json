 "awd_abstract_narration": "A primary goal of transfer programs to the non-aged, non-disabled poor          in the U.S. is to improve the well-being of children in poor families.          In the past, most of the research which has been devoted to the study           of these welfare programs focuses on the incentive effects of the               programs for parents rather than on the question of whether the parents'        participation in such programs measurably benefits children.  Given the         large amounts spent on these transfer programs, an assessment of the            direct effects of parental participation on children is called for.                                                                                             This project will examine the relationship between a mother's                   participation in AFDC, the Food Stamp Program, and public housing, and          various measures of her child's well-being.  These measures will include        the child's birth weight, growth, health, and psychological and                 cognitive test scores.  The study will take advantage of the                    availability of a new data set which links a mother's welfare                   participation to these measures of her child's well-being: the National         Longitudinal survey of Youth Merged Child-Mother File.",
