These materials are derived primarily from                          prehistoric archaeological sites in the Great Plains and the                    state of Tennessee and have been accumulated over a number of                   years.  Unfortunately, they are not properly housed and curated.                The skeletal remains themselves need to be treated to prevent                   deterioration and should be repacked.  Ms Shelley Reisman Paine,                a conservation consultant will examine the collection, produce an               assessment report and recommend a plan of action.  On this basis,               remedial work can be carried out.                                                                                                                               Such skeletal collections constitute an important scientific                    resource which allow one to address a number of questions which                 range from historical origins to human adaptation.  These                       materials form the basis for much biological anthropology                       research and thus should be conserved and made available for                    study.  This grant will assist in these goals.",
