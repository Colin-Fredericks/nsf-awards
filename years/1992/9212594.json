 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last week of October, 1991, Hog Island of the Virginia               Coast Reserve LTER site was overwashed with sea water from the                  combined effects of three weather systems.  The relatively low                  relief of the island contributed to ca. 75% of the island being                 inundated.  There was a tremendous increase in salinity (a                      substantial freshwater lens underlying the island now is 22 ppt                 saline).  This situation presents a unique opportunity to examine               storm-induced changes in the ecosystem that may not happen again                for several decades.  Specifically, this project will study the                 impact of these storms on the dominant woody species of the                     islands, Myrica cerifera (wax myrtle).  Myrica is an \"impact\"                   species, either directly or indirectly affecting many terrestrial               ecological processes on the islands, from island stability, to                  nitrogen availability (it is a N fixer), to bird nesting.  A                    series of field measurements will be conducted to examine                       patterns of Myrica establishment, mortality, and production as                  related to variations in groundwater salinity and subtle changes                in elevation.",
