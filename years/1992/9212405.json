 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nervous systems encode and transmit information in the form of                  electrical signals.  At a cellular level, electrical impulses are               generated and modulated by a class of proteins that form ion                    channels.  One class of ion channel proteins that form calcium-                 activated potassium channels, will be studied.  The PI has cloned               the gene, slowpoke, that codes for these channels in the fruit fly.             A number of different mRNA transcripts that code for slightly                   different proteins are coded for by this gene.  Using molecular                 techniques, a high resolution map of the tissue and developmental               expression of each of the gene products of slowpoke in the nervous              system of the fruit fly will be generated.  This will be correlated             with the biophysical properties of the channels produced.  In                   addition, mutations in slowpoke which result in a unique 'sticky                feet' phenotypic behavior will be used to develop genetic screens               to identify other genes that control slowpoke gene expression.                  These studies promise to provide important information on the                   molecular signals controlling expression of proteins that form ion              channels in nerve cells.  Such information will be relevant to                  understanding development and function in the nervous systems of                both invertebrates and vertebrates, including human.",
