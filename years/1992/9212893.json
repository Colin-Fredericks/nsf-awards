 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arveson will investigate several areas of non-commutative                  analysis involving von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras, quantized              index theory, and the role of the non-commutative spheres of                    Bratteli, Elliott, Evans and Kishimoto in numerical quantum                     mechanics.  The research will involve the index theory and                      classification theory of semigroups of endomorphisms of factors,                the structure of the C*-algebras associated to such semigroups, and             the properties of C*-algebras associated with the discretized                   canonical commutation relations.                                                     The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently                being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
