Infrastructure refers to                                                        transportation systems, waterfront                                              structures, water retaining                                                     structures such as earth dams,                                                  underground structures, and in                                                  general, any structure built on or                                              of soils.  Losses in the                                                        infrastructure due to earthquake                                                damage has been a significant                                                   fraction of the initial                                                         construction costs.                                                                                                                                             Assessment and mitigation of damage                                             to the infrastructure involves                                                  identifying the potential damage to                                             the infrastructure caused by large                                              earthquakes, as well as the                                                     research needed to reduce these                                                 losses through improved design and                                              construction methods.  A particular                                             focus is on verification of these                                               design and construction methods.                                                It is motivated by questions such                                               as:  In the event of a magnitude 8                                              earthquake occurring, can an                                                    estimate be made of the damage to                                               the infrastructure?  Are the                                                    current methods of analysis                                                     adequate to evaluate the potential                                              damage due to a large magnitude                                                 earthquake and to provide an                                                    economic method for strengthening                                               the infrastructure?  These                                                      questions can be answered                                                       effectively only if the procedures                                              used for analysis have been                                                     verified.                                                                                                                                                       This workshop will build upon, and                                              bring together, the results from                                                recent workshops which addressed                                                particular aspects of this broader                                              earthquake hazard mitigation                                                    initiative.  It will be held on                                                 February 4-5, 1992 at the                                                       University of California at Davis.",
