 "awd_abstract_narration": "A full understanding of the crisis in science teaching in the                   elementary and secondary schools of the United States requires a                look at the historical background against which teaching of science             in this country has developed.  How were things done before?  Why               were the choices for presentation made? What were the goals of                  science teaching when it was first introduced?  How has the                     situation changed?                                                                                                                                              Professor Kohlstedt's project constitutes the first comprehensive               analysis of the Nature Study program of teaching science in schools             to consider its scientific outlook, its concern for social and                  environmental issues, the extraordinary diversity of its activities             by region and the ways in which gender issues influenced the                    program and affected its stability.  \"Nature Study\" was an                      international movement that came from Europe to the United States               in the 1890's.  It developed as a method to introduce children to               the natural world in a systematic way.  Professor Kohlstedt is                  examining the period from 1890 to 1930 when the Nature Study                    movement moved beyond the school system to extracurricular and                  public institutions.  She is probing the deceptively simple clarity             of Nature Study's basic proposition--learning from natural objects-             -that was elaborated in textbooks and lesson plans variously                    directed at rural and urban children in both private and public                 schools.  She is reassessing the outlook and activities of those                administrators and teachers who established Nature Study as a                   curriculum and publicized it through lectures and publications.                 Based on the records of normal schools, university archives, school             system records, and the papers of individual teachers and students              as well as the numerous published books and articles on Nature                  Study, this research will document its philosophy, content,                     pedagogy, scientific outlook, and public connections.  This study               promises to be a most important contribution to our understanding               of the processes of science teaching in the US.",
