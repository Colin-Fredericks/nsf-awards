 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major redevelopment project is being undertaken in the                        calculus-differential equations sequence which is taught each                   quarter to about 900 students in the sciences, engineering, and                 computer science.  The most basic concepts of these subjects                    are being developed graphically, and the visual impact of the                   graphical development is expected to lead to a stronger                         qualitative intuition for the subject.  Once the qualitative                    intuition that graphics provides is in place, the students have                 a framework in which to imbed a more quantitative algebraic                     development of the same concepts.  This approach will enhance                   the student's ability in analyzing and then solving scientific                  problems.  For these purposes computers and symbolic                            manipulations software are providing graphical capabilities.                    Equally important to the project is the interactive notebook                    feature of Mathematica which is imperative to the exploratory                   approach incorporated into laboratory projects.  A                              philosophical belief of this project is that experimentation                    fosters intuition; and intuition builds mathematical skills and                 the confidence to use them.",
