 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award is to renovate research and                                      research training facilities in three structures                                at the Nova University Oceanographic Center: the                                Schure, Forman, and Mellon Buildings.  Renovations                              include installation of fixtures and furnishings                                for 8 biological laboratories.                                                       The Oceanographic Center forms a department                                level division of Nova University.  Its mission is                              to perform quality scientific research and to                                   deliver high caliber scientific education.                                      Academic responsibilities have increased                                        considerably in the past two years: the                                         Oceanographic Center faculty is now responsible                                 for all undergraduate science offerings as well as                              graduate programs in Oceanography.  Community                                   outreach is also a priority.  New Center faculty                                have been added and more are planned to meet the                                Center's growing research and education mission.                                Most current biological facilities required for                                 this mission are either inadequate or non-                                      existent.                                                                            Renovations will promote faculty and student                               research activities.  Improved laboratories will                                enhance research efficiency and will allow                                      students to become directly involved in active                                  research projects.  It is anticipated that                                      renovations will attract more and higher quality                                undergraduate and graduate students into Nova's                                 programs in marine and biological sciences.",
