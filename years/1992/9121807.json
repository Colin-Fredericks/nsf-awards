 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two parts.  The first part is concerned with                   developing models for analyzing competition among financial                     intermediaries.  The role of competition in the banking industry                is of particular interest.  In contrast to most other countries,                the US has a long tradition of encouraging competition among a                  large number of banks.  Banks have many special features which mean             that standard economic analyses of competition cannot be directly               applied.  These special features include their role as information              gathering and processing institutions and the fact that there are               significant switching costs for customers.  Models which take                   account of these features and allow their effect on competition to              be analyzed will be developed.  Four areas that the project will                focus on are (i) competition and the costs of bank failure; (ii)                branch networks and competition; (iii) price-setting competition;               (iv) competition and risk-taking behavior by banks.                                                                                                             The second part of the project is concerned with the issue of stock             price manipulation and market microstructure.  In recent years,                 there has been a large literature on how stock exchange specialists             set prices when there is a group of investors that know more about              the stock than the specialist.  This literature has assumed that                there is a group of liquidity traders who are forced to buy or sell             their stock.  It is plausible that some traders have cash needs and             are forced to sell.  However, buyers will typically be able to                  choose the best time to trade.  This asymmetry between liquidity                buyers and sellers means purchases are more likely to be by an                  informed buyer than sales so the price movement resulting from a                purchase is larger.  As a result, profitable manipulation by                    uninformed investors may occur.  Standard models will be used to                consider the possibilities for manipulation, whether these                      activities should be regulated and if so how.",
