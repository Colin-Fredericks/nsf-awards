Drawing upon the scientific disciplines of mathematics,                         biology, physics and psychology, RHYTHM takes as its                            construct the idea of time, the articulation of which means                     for apprehending and understanding rhythm.                                                                                                                      Working with outside advisors in science education and                          specific content areas, Co-PI Michael Oppenheimer will                          develop and build 20 exhibits, which will be semi-                              permanently installed at Children's Discovery Museum and                        accessible to our annual visitor population of 350,000;                         exhibits will also be profiled on \"Kids\" Clubhouse,\" a                          television program developed jointly by the Museum and our                      local PBS affiliate, KTEH/54, viewed by 55,000 weekly.                          Matching funds are also being requested to support                              curricular materials and a traveling version of RHYTHM.                         Over a 2-year, 8-site tour the Association of Science and                       Technology Centers projects that the series will reach a                        national audience of more than 1,000,000 children and                           adults.                                                                                                                                                         As a comprehensive project, RHYTHM provides a compelling                        model for addressing imperatives articulated in Science for                     All Americans, the landmark report issued by Project 2061 of                    the American Association for the Advancement of Science.                                                                                                        Located in San Jose, California, the Museum serves an                           expanding urban area characterized by extraordinary ethnic                      diversity:  Santa Clara County's 1.5 million residents are                      42% non-Anglo, while San Jose is 50.8% Hispanic, Asian and                      Black.",
