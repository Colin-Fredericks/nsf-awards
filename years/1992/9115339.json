(1986) will be              taken to sea to run in real-time mode with the ambient physical                 forcing input to the model.  The real-time application will provide             a continuous view of the predicted water column while at sea, so                that physical and biological (especially photoacclimation state and             photosynthetic rate) samples can be collected at the appropriate                depths to directly test model accuracy.  One version of the model               will be initialized with preliminary measurements of the required               characteristics of the ambient environment using a variety of                   physical sensors as well as a specially designed biological sensor.             A second version will be re-initialized physically every tow hours              to ensure a more precise prediction of the instantaneous state of               the water column.  Validation data will include mixed layer depth               and depth profiles rate.  After the cruise, model refinements will              be developed based on subsequent reruns of the model with recorded              forcing to improve fits to the validation data by considering                   changes in both model formulation and parameterization.  The                    eventual goal is to use the validated biophysical model as a tool               to guide future field applications of the developing                            photoacclimation technology and theory.",
