 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the proposed research is to answer several questions                 regarding adequately formalizing common sense reasoning.  There                 will be three steps.  First, to evaluate and classify some of the               knowledge representation languages, in particular, to compare                   various semantics of logic programs and develop benchmark programs              that distinguish them.  Second, to consider features that are not               handled by the traditional nonmonotonic formalisms and suggest                  methods to handle them.  The particular features considered are:                defining the consistency of a set of default and strict rules, and              being able to infer new defaults from a set of default and strict               rules.  Third, to develop a prototype system to answer queries with             respect to more general knowledge representation language than can              be handled by the systems developed so far, in particular, to                   follow the lead of systems based on the well founded semantics of               normal logic programs to develop a prototype system to answer                   queries with respect to the well founded semantics of a default                 theory.  The significance of the proposed research is that if                   successful it makes both theoretical advances in formalizing common             sense reasoning and provides a prototype implementation of query                answering system for a more general formalism.                                   //",
