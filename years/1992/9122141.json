 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study of the synthesis and reactivity of highly strained                      allenes will be conducted. The proposed investigation will                      include studies of cumulene photochemistry, asymmetric                          photochemical processes, photogeneration of carbenes, and                       photoinduced reactions to give highly strained allenes. A major                 objective is to develop general synthetic methods for the                       generation of strained dienes and trienes. The identity and                     reactivity of the highly strained intermediates will be                         detected by use of matrix isolation methods and transient                       spectroscopy. In addition, attempts to make high molecular                      weight cyclic-type polymers will be conducted via pathways                      involving strained intermediates.                                               %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic dynamics Program supports the work                  of Professor Richard P. Johnson at the University of New                        Hampshire. These investigations will be aimed at the synthesis                  of highly strained organic molecules that are expected to                       undergo a variety of quite unusual reactions. By the                            development of general methods for the synthesis of such                        species, it should be possible to produce a variety of                          compounds which are currenty impossible to generate by any                      other process. The highly reactive strained ring species live                   for only very short periods of time and therefore specialized                   techniques are required to prove their existence.",
