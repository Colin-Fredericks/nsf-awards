 "awd_abstract_narration": "Skeletal muscle is a syncytium ensuing from the fusion of                       myoblasts.  Myoblast fusion is a complex process, involving                     differentiation, myoblast-myoblast adhesion, and cell union.                    Adhesion precedes and is necessary, but not sufficient, for fusion,             indicating separate mechanisms mediate the two events.                                                                                                          The molecules mediating adhesion are being elucidated and two cell              surface glycoproteins, N-CAM and N-cadherin, have been shown by us              to cooperate in promoting myoblast contact during membrane union.               N-cadherin seems to play the dominant role, perhaps reflecting its              intracellular linkage to the cytoskeleton via proteins currently                being identified by us.                                                                                                                                         Little is known about membrane union, except that it involves                   proteins, calcium, and a metalloendoprotease.  One of our goals is              to identify a putative myoblast \"fusion protein\".                                                                                                               Our long-term goal is to develop a comprehensive molecular                      description of myoblast fusion, which will enhance our                          understanding of skeletal myogenesis.  It may also optimize the                 potential success of myoblast transplantation as an approach to                 gene therapy, since long-term survival of donor myoblasts carrying              new genes depends upon their fusion with recipient muscle.                                                                                                      Our past approach has relied heavily on antibodies, but we now need             to apply molecular biology methodologies to our research.  The                  proposal is designed to re-tool our lab for this purpose.",
