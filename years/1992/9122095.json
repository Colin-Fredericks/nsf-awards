 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of research on programming environments is to increase            the productivity of the software-development process by providing               better tools for creating, manipulating, and understanding programs.            During the week of March 9-13,1992, a workshop on programming                   environments will be held at the recently established International             Conference and Research Center for Computer Science (IBFI) at Dagstuhl          Castle in Wadern, Germany.  The workshop will bring together about              forty active researchers in the area.  It will focus on new and recent          developments, with emphasis on the following topics:                                                                                                                      o  Single-programmer language-based environments                                                                                                                o  Generation of programming environments                                                                                                                       o  Tool-integration mechanisms                                                                                                                                  o  Debugging                                                                                                                                                    o  Merging and restructuring of systems                                                                                                                         o  Projection and understanding of systems                                                                                                                      o  Incremental computation                                                                                                                                 The intention of the workshop is to stimulate intellectual                 ferment among the participants.  The workshop's format will make it             possible for participants to give more in-depth presentations than is           customary at conferences.  Presentations that include demonstrations            of working systems or prototypes will be encouraged.  This award                provides funds to cover the transatlantic airfare of the participants           from the United States.",
