 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistical Computing Laboratory                                                Mathematics, engineering, and computer science majors at Tri-                   State University are analyzing real-life statistical data                       relating to environmental concerns of the area's surrounding                    lakes.  By using networked IBM compatible microcomputers and                    statistical software, students in the calculus-based                            probability and statistics sequence are better understanding                    statistical principles and methods.  The project involves                       several individual experiments and one group project for each                   course.  Each group is presenting their results orally in class                 and also completing a written report.  While all groups within                  the course are working on the same project, individual groups                   are presenting different approaches to the problem.  This                       experience of analyzing the problem, followed by analyzing the                  data, and then applying this procedure to actual environmental                  situations is good preparation for college graduates who will                   face problem-solving as young professional scientists and                       engineers.",
