 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to continue gravity monitoring as part of an                 earthquake hazards program in the Beijing region of China.  Gravity             is monitored by means of eight Geodynamics TRG-1 tidal gravimeters              installed at semi-permanent sites, and at a number of stations                  visited periodically with three LaCoste-Romberg Model G                         gravimeters.  The monitoring program was begun in 1981 as part of               the U.S./PRC Protocol on Earthquake Studies and has continued to                the present, thus forming a valuable continuous record exceeding                ten years.  Gravity  is related to elevation changes and subcrustal             mass movements that have been proposed to be a part of the process              of preparation for earthquakes.  This region surrounding Beijing                is designated by the PRC earthquake hazard program as one of high               probability for the next major earthquake in China.  This research              is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program              and the U.S./PRC Earthquake Studies Protocol.",
