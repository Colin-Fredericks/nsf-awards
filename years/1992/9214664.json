 "awd_abstract_narration": "A joint research project between the University of Missouri-Rolla               and the Dalian University of Technology in China is proposed to                 study optimum design of three-dimensional flexible and stiff                    structures with multiple constraints and objective functions.  The              constraints include stability, lateral-torsional motion, design                 code provisions of allowable displacements, stresses, and P-                    effects for various loading conditions.  Research efforts are                   concentrated on 1) structural modeling of reinforced concrete and               steel building systems, 2) development of optimization algorithms               for large structures built of different construction materials, 3)              formulation of objective functions including construction and                   damage costs, 4) serviceability and reliability studies of optimum              design parameters of various structures, 5) experimental                        verification of the damage model for a selected structural system,              and 6)development of optimum-based design criteria and assessment               of current design code provisions.  The collaborative study should              provide a unique opportunity to obtain and validate statistically               the new results for improving current design practice.",
