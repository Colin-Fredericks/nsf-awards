 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the end of his administration, President Eisenhower, himself                 having risen to the highest rank in the US military, a \"general of              the Armies,\" warned about the dangers of the \"military-industrial               complex.\"  A major portion of this complex is the government                    finance of research and development of new weapons of war.  Yet                 this phenomenon is not new:  governments began serious support of               the scientific study of weapons of war in the late 18th century.                The \"father of the chemical revolution,\" Antoine Lavoisier, served              France as the administrator of research on gunpowder.  Indeed,                  France was the locus of the most sustained tradition of scientific              involvement in the development of munitions and explosives up until             the rise of the great superpowers of the 20th century, the US and               the USSR.                                                                                                                                                       Dr. Mauskopf is examining the development of scientifically based               munitions and explosives, concentrating on but not limiting himself             to work in France.  On the basis of his prior investigations, he                has found useful an heuristic patterning involving a research focus             of material (i.e. chemical research) versus a dynamic focus in                  physics research.  There is also a pattern of research locus of                 laboratory versus field studies of the effectiveness of various                 munitions and explosives.  The material focus has to do with such               challenges as the production and purification of the constituents               of the munitions, etc.  The dynamic focus had more to do with                   physical aspects of explosion and to aspects including such                     parameters of explosion as temperature, pressure, rate of burn and              work performed and the relation of the actual physical                          characteristics of the munitions to their mode of explosion.                    Laboratory versus field locus distinguishes between those                       investigations conducted in scaled down laboratory conditions from              those carried out under conditions approximating military use.  Dr.             Mauskopf hypothesizes that there was a progressive amalgamation of              all four components (chemical vs. physical, lab vs. field research)             as research moved to the 20th century.                                                                                                                          The history of the scientific study of munitions and explosives has             hardly been studied before.  This study will not only rectify this              inattention, but will also address issues pertinent to the                      historical relationship between science, technology and industry;               the relationship between scientific research and military                       considerations; and the relationship of science to political and                commercial incentives and patronage.",
