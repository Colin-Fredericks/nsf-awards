 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complex analysis has developed vigorously in this century.                 In particular, there has been great progress in the theory of                   functions of several complex variables; this progress has come                  about as a result of efforts made in many other important areas                 of mathematics.  Three areas in particular have had a profound                  influence on the development of several complex variables.  These               are the methods of partial differential equations, the methods of               complex differential geometry, and the methods of algebraic                     geometry.  This conference will focus on stimulating more                       interaction among the diverse branches of the subject and                       emphasizing ideas common to all the above areas.                                     This project will support a one-week Conference on Several                 Complex Variables to be held at Princeton University from March                 16-20, 1992.  This conference will be held in honor of R. C.                    Gunning and J. J. Kohn.  In addition to the ten principal                       speakers who will give hour long addresses, there will be                       opportunities for shorter talks and more informal discussions.  A               refereed proceedings of the conference is being planned for                     publication.",
