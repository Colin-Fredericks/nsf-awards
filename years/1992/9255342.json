 "awd_abstract_narration": "The California Consortium for Minority Graduate Student                         Education Program is a partnership organization                                 composed of the California State University and the                             University of California systems.  The goal of the                              Consortium's forum is to increase graduate school                               access for underrepresented minority college students.                          Minority students in undergraduate institutions                                 throughout California will be provided with the most                            current information on graduate study opportunities.  A                         number of educators and administrators from federal,                            state and private agencies will present lectures and                            workshops to 500-600 undergraduate and graduate                                 students in a one-day forum at San Jose State                                   University in 1992.                                                             The forum's objectives are i) to provide information on                         sources of funding for graduate study including support                         from MARC and MBRS programs, NSF fellowships and                                minority supplements on federal grants; ii) to                                  demonstrate more effective ways to prepare for the                              graduate record examination;  iii) to expose students                           to graduate school recruiters, and encourage them to                            establish an early relationship with graduate advisors                          in their field of research interest.",
