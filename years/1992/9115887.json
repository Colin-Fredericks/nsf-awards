 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in              experimental physical chemistry between Tomas Baer of the                       University of North Carolina and Paul Marie Guyon of the                        University of Paris (South).  The primary objective of the project is           to investigate the mechanism for the formation of high-lying                    electronic states in gases by producing low-energy electrons.  The              experimental approach is based on the use of both pulsed                        synchrotron radiation as a light source and laser-based techniques.             The project will benefit significantly from access to unique                    facilities in France.  Dr. Guyon and his group will conduct the                 initial electron and ion timing experiments on the Orsay                        synchrotron.  The dispersed light from the synchrotron is                       advantageous for scanning molecules across a wide range of energy               levels.  This is complemented by subsequent experiments at the                  University of North Carolina using laser light in more limited                  energy regions.  This combined effort will result in improved                   experimental techniques for the physical and chemical analysis of               gases.",
