 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Shrinivas Kulkarni is receiving the Alan T. Waterman award for              his work on pulsars, the interstellar medium and astronomical                   instrumentation.  He was co-discoverer of the first known                       millisecond pulsar.  His research group has carried out surveys to              discover pulsars in globular clusters and is responsible for about              1/3 of the known examples.  He has also investigated many                       individual pulsars.  This work has included the detection of x-                 ray emission from a millisecond pulsar and the discovery of one of              the oldest known examples of a pulsar associated with a supernova               remnant.  He showed that a peculiar radio source was a supernova                remnant with a pulsar embedded in its rim.  This implies that                   supernova explosion was highly asymmetric and ejected the resulting             neutron star at high velocity.  His studies of the interstellar                 medium have demonstrated the existence of a magneto-ionic disk in               the galaxy which extends out to 25 kpc while providing the first                high-resolution images in the 3-mm line of CO for another galaxy,               M 51.  In the area of instrumentation he developed a pulsar timing              instrument with a wide band width and fast signal processor.  This              device permits the detection of fainter and shorter period pulsars              than had been possible previously.  He has developed an optical                 interferometer which can produce diffraction limited images of                  stars.  Observations of the long period variable star Mira with the             200 inch telescope at Mt. Palomar Observatory showed that the star              is not round and is, thus, likely to be undergoing non-radial                   oscillations.  He is currently carrying out studies of optical                  interferometry aimed at combining those techniques with                         developments in adaptive optics.",
