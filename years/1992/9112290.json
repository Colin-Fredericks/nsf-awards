 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, issues of access to scientific data have sparked               intense controversy and public policy debate.  Little has been                  written, however, on how scientists decide who gets access to which             data and under what terms and conditions.  Little has been written              about how laws, regulations and policies shape and are shaped by                data access practices.  This project provides empirical study and               analysis of this process.  Drawing on insights and procedures from              ethnographic studies of scientific laboratories, this project will              examine actual practices of scientists regarding access to data.                Using interviewing methods, the principal investigators will                    examine access practices in one scientific specialty:  research on              molecular structures (e.g., x-ray crystallography and NMR).  They               will interview four categories of respondents:  scientists who have             been involved in public debate about access to data, scientists who             are \"gatekeepers,\" such as journal editors; other scientists doing              molecular structures research; and attorneys who have been involved             in data access negotiations.  The interviews will examine how                   scientists and others construct and erase boundaries to access, the             relationship between circumstances and methods of control, and the              terms in which scientists and lawyers frame arguments concerning                data access and justify their practices and decisions.  Comparisons             will be made with results from a study of practices in molecular                genetics.                                                                                                                                                       This proposal comes from a uniquely qualified pair of investigators             who have found appropriate advisors with which to undertake the                 project.  The topic is a central one in Ethics and Values Studies.              Institutional auspices are very good.  The framework and approach               to the subject is suitable, and the research plan good.  The                    project is likely to improve our understanding of how laws and                  other social sanctions affect data sharing and acknowledgement.                 I recommend support.",
