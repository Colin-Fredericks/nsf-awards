 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Yau will study several fundamental problems in                   complex geometry including solutions to the complex Plateau                     problem and the embedding problem for three dimensional CR                      manifolds. He will also try to extend previous work on finite                   dimensional Lie algebras and isolated hypersurface singularities                to higher codimension singularities.                                                 This award will support research in three basic areas of                   complex differential geometry. The complex Plateau problem is a                 geometric minimization problem. The goal of the proposed research               is to classify those real odd-dimensional real submanifolds which               are boundaries of complex manifolds. This work is closely                       connected to research on CR manifolds - spaces which usually                    occur as subspaces of complex space. Although most of the work                  which will be supported by this proposal falls into the area of                 what has been called \"pure mathematics\", much of Professor Yau's                work in this field has found application in control theory and                  filtering. The work thus serves as a reminder of the link between               basic research and application.",
