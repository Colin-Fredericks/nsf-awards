 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to New Jersey Institute of                     Technology's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                Hazardous Substance Management, for a project titled \"Creation of               an Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers' Center                     Director's Handbook.\"  Currently the only document available to                 I/UCRC directors which provides operational guidance is a 10-year               old, 27 page document that only addresses three aspects of center               operations.  The Committee of Visitors, which recently reviewed                 the I/UCRC program, recommended that this document be revised.                  The new handbook, to be produced under this award, will codify                  and document the collective managerial knowledge acquired by                    I/UCRC participants and translate this knowledge into operational               \"art and science\" so that it can be communicated more efficiently               and effectively to Center directors.  The authors, Dr. George                   Walters and Dr. Dennis Gray, propose to research, develop and                   produce such a Handbook for I/UCRC Center Directors which                       incorporates the experience and wisdom possessed by a variety of                individuals such as NSF staff, Center Directors, and Evaluators                 associated with the I/UCRC program throughout the history of the                program.  The Handbook will contain the following elements: 1)                  introduction; 2) recommended policies, procedures, and/or                       practices for an I/UCRC; and 3) appendices.                                          The Program Director recommends that New Jersey Institute of               Technology be awarded $68,000, for 18 months, to undertake and                  complete the I/UCRC Center Directors Handbook.",
