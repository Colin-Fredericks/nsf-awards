 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project dramatically changes  the method of instruction of                 the engineering mechanics course, Dynamics, which is                            traditionally taught in a lecture discussion environment, to                    sophomore students from several engineering disciplines.  The                   project's innovative learning climate will consist of a                         classroom filled with NeXT computer workstations, ample desktop                 space, white boards, screen projection system, and symbolic                     algebra packages.This highly advanced classroom makes possible                  revolutionary teaching of dynamics, and in doing so will: (1)                   allow a focus on problem solving rather than mathematical                       gymnastics (2) allow the instructor to construct and                            illustrate, online and in class, the problem analysis and set-                  up using symbolic algebra; (3) permit the instructor and                        student to check answers to complicated problems using symbolic                 algebra; (4) experience \"what if\" conditions to problem                         analysis and instantaneously observe (graphically) the                          consequences of change; (5) continue to reinforce the                           workstation learning approach used in the integrated freshman                   curriculum and math department at Rose Hulman; (6) provide an                   opportunity to present material and problem solving heretofore                  omitted because less class time will be spent solving                           equations; (7) empower instructors with an opportunity to                       expand the complexity, scope, and fidelity of dynamics problems                 8) reinforce the question of \"Does the answer make sense?\"                      afforded by faster solutions, graphical verification, and                       online animation.",
