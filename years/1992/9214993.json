 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop an Hoo optimization                                       approach which will allow in addition to the                                    customary frequency-domain specifications,                                      explicit time-domain specifications.  The latter                                specifications include shaping of the transient                                 characteristics of the system by requiring that                                 the step response lies in a given envelope,                                     specifying that actuator signals do not exceed                                  certain hard bounds in order to avoid                                           saturation, etc.  We refer to this approach as                                  Constrained Hoo optimization.                                                                                                                                   In the proposed approach the time-domain                                        specifications are introduced as constraints onto                               the Hoo optimization.  We expect to establish a                                 decomposition of the latter problem to i) a finite                              dimensional convex optimization problem and ii)                                 a standard Hoo optimization problem.  This                                      method will be capable of handling structured                                   model uncertainty in as much the same way as                                    Hoo optimization methods such as u-synthesis                                    do.  The approach will also inherit the                                         algorithmic nature of Hoo optimization methods                                  and systematically provide trade-offs between                                   conflicting specifications, including specifications                            posed directly in the time-domain.  It will be                                  capable of revealing the achievable performance                                 limits at a reasonable computational cost.  We                                  expect to establish that the controllers produced                               within this framework will have properties that                                 guarantee effective degree reduction to the level                               of standard Hoo optimal controllers and                                         specialized controller reduction schemes will be                                developed.                                                                                                                                                      In summary, our expected results should provide                                 a general, systematic and practical approach for                                robust multivariable control system design with                                 structured uncertainty, in which established                                    measures of performance in the time-domain are                                  incorporated explicitly, while the applicability of                             standard Hoo methods is retained in full.  We                                   believe that the proposed research offers a                                     unique approach to the important subject of                                     Robust Control of Constrained Systems.",
