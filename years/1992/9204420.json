 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of molecular cations to migrate and undergo                         chemical reactions will be determined in a variety of different                 environments including low viscosity liquids at room                            temperature, glasses at 77 K, and highly viscous oligomers and                  polymers. Polymers to be investigated  range from                               chloropolymers such as polyvinylchloride to polystyrene and                     polyethylene. The cationic species will be generated by                         exposure of polycyclic hydrocarbons such as anthracene,                         naphthalene, and pyrene to high-energy radiation produced from                  a Fabretron. The resulting cationic species will be detected by                 transient spectroscopy on a picosecond time scale. In addition                  to the kinetic analysis of the cation migration rate, an                        investigation of the rate of fluorescence quenching of both                     absorbed and surface bound pyrene at solid-air and solid-liquid                 interfaces of silicon oxide will be conducted. The effect of                    the surface on the generation of charged species from                           exciplexes will also be determined by diffuse reflectance                       transient absorption spectroscopy. The results of these                         investigations will lead to a better understanding of the                       reactions of cationic species at surfaces and the factors                       governing efficient quenching processes.                                        %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor J. Kerry Thomas at the University                  of Notre Dame. The studies will be directed toward                              understanding the effect of surfaces on the reactivity of                       chemical substances and will provide critical data which will                   allow the development of more efficient chemical systems. The                   investigation will utilize equipment capable of detecting                       events on the order of less than a billionth of a second. Thus                  it will be possible to measure the rapid hopping of charged                     species in a variety of media. The use of target molecules                      which undergo rapid fluorescence decay processes provides a                     means of monitoring chemical processes on a time scale which                    would otherwise be inaccessible.",
