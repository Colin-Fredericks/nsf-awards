This research                  will finalize the methodology for a study of the impact of                      parents' occpuational experiences on family processes and                       children's well being among African-American families with                      preschool children.  Currently there are two limitations of the                 work-family literature: (1) a failure to consider the ways in                   which the cultural context in which families operate may                        condition linkages between work and family life, and (2) a                      failure to elaborate the mechanisms through which parental                      employment impacts children.  This support will facilitate                      instrument development and identification of an adequate sampling               frame from which to select respondents.  Other scholars, and                    service providers who have expertise in these two areas will be                 consulted.",
