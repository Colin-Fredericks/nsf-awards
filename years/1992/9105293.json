 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are a large number of proteins whose three dimensional                    structures have been determined.  However, virtually very                       little is known as to how these proteins are folded.  In order                  to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of protein folding, the                   role of the pro-sequence in the folding of subtilisin E, an                     alkaline serine protease produced by Bacillus subtilis has been                 studied.  This protein is produced from the pre-pro subtilisin                  consisting of the pro-sequence (signal peptide) of 21 residues,                 the pro-sequence of 77 residues, and the mature protease of 275                 residues.  The pro-sequence is absolutely essential for the                     production of enzymatically active subtilisin, and functions as                 an intramolecular chaperon for protein folding.                                 This is a novel, unprecedented finding and provides and ideal                   and unique system for studying the molecular mechanisms of                      protein folding.  In this application the exact role of the                     pro-sequence in the folding pathway will be elucidated. It is                   of interest to investigate how the pro-sequence interacts with                  mature, active subtilisin and pursue biochemical and                            biophysical characterization of pro-subtilisin and of pro-                      peptides of various sequences and lengths.  By using molecular                  genetic approaches as well as synthetic pro-peptides, the site                  or regions responsible for refolding denatured subtilisins will                 be determined.  The goal in this proposal is to elucidate the                   precise roles of the pro-peptide in the folding of subtilisin,                  which is expected to provide important insight into                             understanding of the molecular mechanisms of protein folding.                   For this purpose, the following experiments will be performed:                  1. Isolation of mutant pro-subtilisins defective in                             autoprocessing and their characterization; 2.  Isolation and                    characterization of mutations within the pro-peptide defective                  in producing active subtilisin; 3.  Isolation of second site                    suppressor mutations a new method developed in the laboratory                   will be extensively employed using localized PCR random                         mutagenesis; 4.  Characterization of folding intermediated                      accumulated as a result of mutations; 5.  Production of the                     wild-type and mutant pro-peptides by organic synthesis and by                   recombinant DNA technology.  Their biochemical an biophysical                   characterization and their interaction with mature subtilisin.",
