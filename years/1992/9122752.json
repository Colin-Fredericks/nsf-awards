 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines three experiments designed to test                       predictions of a new model of the evolution of distyly.  This model             differs from the most widely accepted model by assuming a different             ancestral state and by focusing on the efficiency of pollen                     donation, as well as receipt.  It also differs in predicting that               the morphological features of distyly evolve prior to the                       compatibility groups.  The first experiment examines pollen                     transfer by bumblebees between plexiglass flowers with varying                  anther and stigma heights.  Populations of flowers will be created              with the combinations of organ heights outlined in the models, to               see whether the purported changes in organ heights bring about the              increases in pollen donation predicted.  The other two experiments              will take place at the La Selva Biological Station, using                       Psychotria suerrensis and one of its butterfly pollinators.  In the             individual-level experiment, pollen donation will be observed on                controlled sequences of flowers and pollen carryover will be                    measured.  In the population-level experiment, the type of pollen               available in an isolated population will be controlled by                       emasculation of all other flowers of one morph and half of the                  flowers of the other morph.  This will allow a direct comparison                between pollen donation to like and unlike morphs.  As well as                  being among the first designed to test the new model, these                     experiments contribute to the study of pollination biology.  In                 addition, the field work will be conducted on a member of a                     distylous genus which has received relatively little study, despite             its large size and wide distribution.",
