 "awd_abstract_narration": "To improve calculus instruction by placing a greater emphasis                   on conceptual understanding, Elizabethtown College is                           incorporating the use of the computer algebra system DERIVE                     into its calculus sequence.  Shifting the burden of computation                 to DERIVE allows students to concentrate more fully on learning                 ideas and fosters a more inquisitive attitude towards                           mathematics.  Students meet in the computer laboratory twice a                  week to work through laboratory problems designed to teach,                     illustrate, and reinforce the concepts of calculus.  In                         addition once a week, they meet in the laboratory to work in                    groups solving problems involving applications of what they                     have learned.  The fourth weekly class is used for class                        discussion and group presentations.  An accompanying laboratory                 manual, which is being written, will be of interest to other                    institutions thinking of using a computer algebra system as a                   tool in calculus instruction.  Initially, two sections of the                   courses are running concurrently, one with laboratories and one                 without, so that a comparative study can be developed to                        determine whether and to what extent the new course structure                   is an improvement.",
