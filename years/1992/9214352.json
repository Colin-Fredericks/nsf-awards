 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biology Department of Seton Hall                                       University proposes to renovate and convert a 1200                              square foot laboratory into two research                                        laboratories and a common instrument room for two                               new faculty members with expertise in cell                                      signalling and molecular biology respectively.                                  The area has been dedicated to cell culture and                                 classical virology.  This facility has not                                      received major attention since 1951.                                                 The present laboratory space is poorly                                     designed to accommodate new faculty.  For example,                              there is a 400 square foot glassware washing room                               but no equivalent research area.  The temporary                                 walls that were constructed in 1968, divide the                                 space up into an extremely inefficient suite of                                 rooms without adequate ventilation and utilities.                               The area will be gutted, walls will be constructed                              to better divide the facilities and a new HVAC                                  unit will be put in to provide much needed                                      ventilation.  Two new laminar flow hoods as well                                as a fume hood will be added.  All new laboratory                               benches with appropriate utilities will be                                      installed.                                                                           NSF funding of this proposal will facilitate                               a symbiosis of research activity between new and                                veteran faculty.",
