 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the disparate nature of environmental conditions in oceanic              and freshwater systems, the characteristics of these environments               strongly influence total population structure of species with                   plastic life history patterns.  To conduct meaningful research on               these processes, it is essential to identify which life history                 stages and/or environmental events are significant.  The Arctic                 charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) is characterized by a variety of                  morphological types.  These morphs appear to be reflect differences             in environmental conditions.  This project will investigate the                 relationships between morph, growth and environmental history.                                                                                                  This research will apply novel analytic techniques to evaluate the              periods in the life history of the Arctic charr.  The otoliths of               fish have incorporated within their structural and chemical                     components a large amount of life history and physiological                     information.  Age, growth rate and environmental perturbations                  will be determined from otolith microstructure, while                           environmental trends in the history of an individual will be                    determined through elemental composition analyses of otoliths.                  The result of these investigations will be a comprehensive and                  detailed understanding of physiologically and ecologically                      induced changes in otolith microstructure and chemical                          composition.   This knowledge is vital to an understanding of the               processes foundational to adaptable life history patterns and                   should make it possible to link growth and migration to                         nutritional and environmental occurrences.",
