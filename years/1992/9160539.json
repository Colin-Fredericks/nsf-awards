This Phase I project will focus on high school                        geometry, and address the new NCTM Standards with an agenda based               on a discovery approach to mathematics realized through                         cooperative student learning.  The proposal describes an                        inservice model which addresses the issues of applying new                      pedagogical directions to existing classroom, schoolwide, and                   district structures; assessing inservice results with metrics of                both student and teacher-participant performance; and                           establishing a mechanism by which the inservice's dissemination                 can financially and motivationally self-perpetuation process.",
