 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                        Chemistry Division, Prof. Paul N. Schatz will study the                         magnetooptical spectroscopy of large polyatomic systems, such                   as fullerenes and porphyrins, in low-temperature noble gas                      matrices.   Prof. Schatz expects to obtain basic electronic                     structural information about the ground and excited states of                   molecular, ionic, mixed-valent, and radical species using                       magnetic circular dichroism and magnetic circularly polarized                   luminescence spectroscopies and their zero-field counterparts.                  He will also perform theoretical analyses to fit the spectra in                 order to obtain spectroscopic parameters for these systems.                     %%%                                                                             By studying the spectroscopy of atoms, molecules, radicals, and                 their respective ions captured in very cold matrices consisting                 of solids made from noble-gas atoms, scientists can learn much                  about their molecular structure and other important properties.                 Prof. Schatz will use magnetic fields and polarized light to                    aid him in understanding the electronic spectra of several                      chemically interesting species and to acquire information which                 can not be obtained any other way.  Among the most interesting                  are fullerene compounds (molecules made exclusively from carbon                 atoms arranged in closed geometric solids) and their positive                   and negative ions as well as porphyrin systems.  The former                     compounds are relevant to materials science because of recent                   applications to areas such as high-temperature                                  superconductivity.  The latter are important to bioinorganic                    chemistry and have relevance to a number of biological sytems.",
