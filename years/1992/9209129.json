 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators develop a two-dimensional (axisymmetric)                 nonlinear mathematical model of viscous flow in tapered free                    moving elastic tubes, a numerical method to solve the model, and                an ultrasonic method to measure the movement of vessel walls in                 an experimental model.  The model is intended to represent blood                flow in large arteries with stenoses and atherosclerosis.                       Detailed localized numerical solution for the flow in free moving               elastic tubes with local hardening, thickening and occlusions is                obtained.  Corresponding experiments are made in the lab using                  elastic tubes.  The numerical and experimental results are                      compared and the mathematical model may be further refined.                     Those results are also compared with published results of in vivo               measurements to verify the validity of the models and techniques.               The numerical results obtained and experimental techniques                      developed in this project will lead to better understanding of                  blood flow in large arteries and may be of clinical value in the                future.                                                                              As is well-known, cardiovascular diseases are the leading                  causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States.  Specific               diseases are typically atherosclerosis, stenoses, and aneurysms                 that often remain undetected due to inadequate diagnostic                       techniques.  This research aims to provide a valid improved                     mathematical model for blood flow in large arteries, an efficient               numerical method for mathematical simulations, and an accurate                  noninvasive ultrasound measurement technique.  These could be                   very useful for the early diagnosis of blood vessel diseases and                therefore have the potential to save many lives in the future.                  The numerical method developed in this project is also applicable               to many other free moving boundary problems and is itself of                    significance to applied mathematics.",
