 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamics in Glassy and Disordered Systems - The intent of this                  project is to continue previous studies of dynamics in glassy and               disordered systems, focusing on three areas.  The numerical enzyme              technique (previously developed by the PI) will be used to                      accelerate the dynamics of a two-component Lennard-Jones model, to              test and refine the PI's scaling theory of the glass transition.                The charge-density-wave depinning transition will also be studied,              in particular examining the sparse regime and phase-organization in             the avalanches which occur on the pinned side of the transition.                Finally, the study of logarithmic coarsening in Ising models                    without disorder will be shifted from three-dimensional to two-                 dimensional, and the scaling and critical properties will be                    extracted from the simulation.  A major theme in the proposed                   research is development of the PI's ideas concerning Darwinian                  selection of numerical enzymes to accelerate Monte Carlo                        simulation.                                                                     %%%                                                                             One of the principal areas of current research in statistical                   physics is the nature and formation of glassy states.  Despite the              lack of detailed understanding concerning the glassy state (even                the identification of glass as a well-defined thermodynamic state               is unclear), glass is the standard paradigm for random systems in               general.  Beyond the obvious benefit to be generated by obtaining               a better understanding of glass (one of our societies most                      important structural materials), the possibility of refining the                analogy between glass and other, closely-related systems as is a                relevant goal.  The techniques which are being developed for this               study (numerical enzymes) are quite new, and further investigation              of their properties, potential, and limitations is an additional                part of the project.  The impact of this new class of simulation                techniques on materials science is potentially very great.",
