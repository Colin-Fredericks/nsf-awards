 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for the                                    renovation of a portion of the research space of                                the Department of Geology of the University of                                  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Funding of this                                  renovation will provide substantially improved                                  facilities for an active group of faculty who have                              shown the capacity to effectively use available                                 resources.  The space is located in the Natural                                 History Building, which was built in 1892.  Most                                of the space has not been significantly renovated                               since the 1950's or early 1960's and is presently                               unsuited for modern research purposes.                                               The space to be renovated is devoted almost                                entirely to research and associated research                                    training.  It includes laboratories for                                         sedimentary petrology, paleontology, stable                                     isotope geochemistry, radiogenic isotope and trace                              element geochemistry, engineering geology,                                      experimental mineralogy and petrology, and rock                                 sample preparation.  Renovation of this space will                              provide 10 of the 19 faculty members of the                                     Department with new or substantially improved                                   research facilities and will significantly                                      increase their research capacity.",
