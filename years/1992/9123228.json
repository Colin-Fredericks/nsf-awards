 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many polar fishes produce macromolecular antifreezes that act in                non-colligative way to prevent freezing.  Some arctic fishes in the             Smelt and Greenling families use a novel method to avoid freezing.              These fishes increase the freezing point depression of their body               fluids by producing high concentrations of glycerol in winter.                  This study will focus on the high glycerol concentrations in arctic             fishes and the physiological and biochemical implications they have             on water balance, kidney and gill function, and metabolism of                   energy stores.  Conservation of glycerol by the kidney and gills                will be investigated by measuring glomerular filtration rate, urine             flow, drinking rate and permeability of the gills to glycerol.                  Because glycerol is present only in winter, seasonal variations in              these parameters will be determined.  The source and fate of                    glycerol will be determined with assays of glycogen, lipid and key              enzymes using cold- and warm-acclimated fish.  Additional studies               will be conducted to determine the maximum concentrations of                    glycerol that occur in cold-acclimated fishes, the environmental                conditions that regulate its production, and the occurrence of                  glycerol in other species.  A puzzling characteristic of the smelts             is that they have both colligative and non-colligative antifreezes.             Further studies will be undertaken to explain why two different                 antifreezes are needed in these species.",
