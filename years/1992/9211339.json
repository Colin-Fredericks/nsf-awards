 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in theoretical condensed matter physics will be performed              using both large scale numerical simulations and analytical                     techniques to study the properties of homogeneous, inhomogeneous                and artificially fabricated superconducting systems.  This work is              motivated by experimental discoveries and will, in turn, lead to                predictions which can be tested by experiment.  The problems to be              studied include quantum fluctuation induced transitions; metastable             magnetic properties; and, real time vortex dynamics, including                  self-field effects.  The results obtained from this research will               enhance our understanding of the physics of photolithographically               fabricated arrays of ultrasmall Josephson junction arrays and of                high temperature superconductors.                                               %%%                                                                             Research on a variety of problems of current interest in condensed              matter physics revolving around the properties of very large arrays             of ultrasmall Josephson junctions - a type of superconducting                   switch - will be undertaken.  These arrays are important in their               own right for possible applications to superconducting                          microelectronics and are also important for what they can tell us               about the basic physics of high temperature superconductors and                 problems in disordered systems.",
