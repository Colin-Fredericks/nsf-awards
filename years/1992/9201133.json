 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is directed toward the design of novel polyamides based               on the incorporation of sequential and mimetic residues, similar to             those found in proteins.  The research expects to find new                      structures which can form biomaterials.  The polymers are mimetic               structures related to or different from those present in standard               nylons and proteins.  For the characterization of these polymers,               Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism (where              applicable), solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance,               electron microscopy and fiber diffraction techniques will be                    employed.  The researchers will also utilize computer simulations               to determine the preferred conformations for the polymers and model             compounds.  The goal is also to design and synthesize a series of               optically active polyoxazolines.  These polymers represent a broad              class of novel peptidomimetic structures.  The conformations of                 these macromolecules and their model compounds will be examined.                Both sequence copolymers and the polyoxazolines should have                     potential uses as sutures, biomedical devices, and drug-delivery                matrices.  Through a study of structure, conformation and                       properties, the researchers hope to develop new classes of                      peptidomimetic polyamides.  This program has as its objective the               preparation and characterization of complex molecular structures                that mimic naturally occurring biopolymers.",
