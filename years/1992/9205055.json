 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rock weathering is an often underestimated yet ubiquitous                  force, sculpting and changing the landscape, predominantly                      influenced by rock composition and environmental factors.                       Previous research has recognized the importance of obtaining                    quantitative data on the weathering rates of rocks.  While                      research has shown that lichen overgrowth disrupts and erodes the               substrate, little quantitative data have been collected on this                 weathering phenomenon.  Lichens represent the dominant biological               species on eight percent of the Earth's surface.  Their                         ubiquitousness may establish lichens as a greater pedogenetic                   factor than previously understood.  This project will investigate               the quantifiable effect of lichen overgrowth on substrate surface               weathering , removal, and potential pedogenesis.  Research will                 be conducted in the Petra region of Jordan to determine lichen-                 induced erosion in controlled circumstances from the late                       Pleistocene to the present.  Regression models will be developed                and tested to determine rates of weathering under differing                     conditions of time, exposure of the rock to sunlight, proximity                 to surface, location of water flows, and other environmental                    variables.  Radiocarbon dating and timing of human carvings in                  sandstone will be used to establish when weathering took place.                      This study should fill several missing niches in the                       weathering literature by connecting the factors responsible for                 lichen growth, by providing information on the process by which                 lichen alters rock, and by estimating the quantity of weathered                 by-products.  Knowledge of the quantity of substrate weathering                 over time should inform archaeological research on lichen induced               alteration of petroglyphs and geoglyphs, pedological research on                substrate change into pedogenetic material, lichenology through                 the development of a potential dryland lichenometric growth                     curve, and geography through an assessment of spatial variability               of weathering rates.",
