The focus of this proposal is the characterization of a novel                   Drosophila melanogaster growth factor gene, defective dorsal                    discs.                                                                                                                                                          The objectives are to extend the molecular characterization of                  the ddd gene and identify genes in the same signalling pathway.                 The region encompassing seven DNA lesions that cause ddd                        phenotypes has been cloned but because off repetitive motifs, and               rarity  of the message, no transcription unit has been found.                   Two approaches will be used to identify the transcription unit:                 in situ hybridization to tissues using probes from the region,                  and sequence conservation with Drosophila virills.  Probes from                 the transcribed region will be used to isolate cDNAs which will                 be sequenced to predict the encoded protein.  Genomic DNA will be               sequenced if no cDNA can be isolated.  The transcription pattern                during development will be described.  Phenotypically related                   genes will be mapped, checked for complementation with known                    genes, and cloned by plasmid rescue.",
