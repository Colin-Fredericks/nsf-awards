 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                      (EPSCoR) in the state of South Dakota EPSCoR consists of an                     infrastructure improvement plan and two research clusters.                      Infrastructure improvements will take place within the                          context of cluster projects which are interdisciplinary in                      scope and inter-institutional in involvement.  EPSCoR                           improvements will enhance the research competitiveness of                       over 30 faculty at three institutions (the University of                        South Dakota, South Dakota State University, and the South                      Dakota School of Mines and Technology).  The research                           cluster areas are:  (1) Surface and Interfacial Chemistry                       and (2) Regulation of Biological Processes:  The Role of                        Membranes.  The state's infrastructure improvement plan                         focuses on the development of human resources, on providing                     an environment that is conducive to competitive research,                       and on building the visibility of scientific research in                        South Dakota.  Specific objectives are: to develop science                      faculty in both numbers and competitiveness, to strengthen                      graduate  programs through competitive recruiting efforts,                      to add research equipment and support personnel, and to                         establish an effective system for communication between                         scientists, between scientists and policy makers, and                           between scientists and the South Dakota citizenry.  A                           Coordinator for Human Resources Development will oversee                        activities aimed at students and teachers in elementary,                        middle and high schools.  Non-federal state and                                 institutional resources of over $6 million will be                              contributed to ensure the success of the state's EPSCoR                         effort over the three year award period.",
