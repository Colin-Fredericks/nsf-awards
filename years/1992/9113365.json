 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the research is to address the nature of sub-Tg                      relaxations in some high-temperature glassy polymers.  The                      relaxation behaviors of polycarbonates and other rigid aromatic                 backbone glassy polymers will be investigated.  The low-temperature             relaxation of bisphenol-A polycarbonate has an extensive in-chain               cooperative character.  This cooperative motion is thought to be                the key to polycarbonate's superior mechanical properties.  The                 origin of this in-chain cooperativity and the relaxation behavior               of other kinds of glassy polymers can be better understood by using             tailored molecular architectures together with dynamic mechanical               measurements.  Once the origin of cooperative motion is understood,             an important question will be answered:  How does the scale of this             cooperative motion affect intermolecular interactions?  Dynamic                 bulk relaxation experiments will be used to address this question.              Another question to be answered in the proposed research deals with             how the scale of cooperative motion affects the mechanical                      properties of the polymer in terms of ductility and brittleness.                Through this research, the relationships between molecular                      structure, relaxation and mechanical properties will be further                 clarified and the results can be used as guidelines to design and               synthesize new high-temperature ductile polymers with desirable                 properties.",
