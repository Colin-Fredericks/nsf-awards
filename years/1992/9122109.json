University will study vibrational potential energy surfaces in                  electronically excited states of molecules in a supersonically                  cooled jet.  Fluorescence excitation spectra and sensitized                     phosphorescence excitation spectra will be recorded for four-,                  five-, and six-membered ring compounds as well as for various                   carbonyl and aromatic molecules.  A comparison with potential                   functions and conformations for ground singlet and excited                      singlet and triplet states will be made.  Ab initio                             calculations will also be carried out to help provide a better                  theoretical basis for understanding the changes resulting from                  electronic excitation.                                                          %%%                                                                             The study of large-amplitude vibrational motions of non-rigid                   molecules provides information about the forces and energies                    which govern the conformational changes in these floppy                         molecules, that is, the changes from one \"stable\" structure to                  another \"stable\" structure.  This information can be described                  by a mathematical function called a potential energy surface.                   Information about the rate at which one structure will convert                  to another and back again is also provided by such studies.                     This project will gather information about potential energy                     surfaces of several types of non-rigid ring molecules,                          emphasizing the changes in the surfaces that occur when the                     molecule is supplied enough energy to excite an electron to                     higher energy states.  Calculations will also be carried out to                 provide a theoretical basis for understanding the structural                    and potential energy changes resulting from electronic                          excitation.",
