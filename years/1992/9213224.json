 "awd_abstract_narration": "This professional development fellowship will enable the                        recipient to immerse herself in the research activities at the                  Ames National Laboratory in three major areas:  materials                       chemistry, condensed matter physics and metallurgy and ceramics.                Over the course of two summers, by participating in lab group                   meetings, discussing research and research results and                          publications with group members, and attending symposia at                      scientific meetings, this historian of science and technology                   will gain scientific and technical literacy to help her in her                  research.  The research involves an exploration of the                          relationships between the process of scientific research and its                organization, management, and funding.  To explore this                         relationship the investigator will examine the history of                       scientific activity at Ames Laboratory.  In its forty-five year                 tenure the facility has expanded and become more complex.                       However, small-scale, single-investigator laboratory-based                      research continues to define its msision.  The investigator will                also be able to conduct oral interviews with present and former                 laboratory personnel, to chronicle their recollections of the                   history of Ames.  During the academic year, the investigator will               research other aspects of the project, including Frank Spedding's               papers and the archivals resources at the laboratory, Iowa State                University, the Department of Energy and its Chicago field                      office.  The internship will help to put those sources in                       context, while research during the academic year will raise new                 issues for discussion with the laboratory scientists during the                 second summer.  Results from this research will be of benefit to                policy makers and scientists as institutional bureaucracies and                 mechanisms of management and funding for science are                            restructured.",
