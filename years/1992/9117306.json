 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Ann Stahl, Mr. Andrew Black will                     collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  He will pursue                     combined ethnographic and archaeological research in the Brong-                 Ahafo region of central Ghana.  The area is interesting because                 it spans the transition from forest in the south to dry savannah                in the north and this ecotonal quality allows residents to                      exploit a wide range of resources.  Taken together                              archaeological, historic and ethnographic data allow the                        reconstruction of settlement and subsistence over a ca. 500 year                period.  Mr. Black will examine food utilization and the study                  will consist of two phases.  He will conduct four months of                     ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological research to learn how wild                 and domestic animals are integrated into contemporary diet and                  how diets can be reconstructed from faunal remains.  Secondly, he               will analyze collections from at least three different                          archaeological sites which span the period from 1400 AD to 1930                 AD.  The ethnographic data will be used to help interpret the                   archaeological material, serve as a basis for comparison, and                   help to model the essential components of prehistoric subsistence               patterns.                                                                                                                                                       The late prehistory and history of this region is complicated                   because it witnessed the development of complex polities as well                as the imposition of a European colonial system.  Local groups                  relied not only on domestic animals which they raised, but also                 on hunted and gathered wild resources.  Given the significant                   changes in social organization over this period, Mr. Black                      hypothesizes that subsistence practices changed as well and he                  wishes to understand how local residents changed their hunting                  and herding strategies to adapt.                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons.  While it has                   long been assumed that such Western African peoples have been                   solely dependent on domestic resources for hundreds of years,                   anthropological data suggests otherwise.  Understanding                         successful adaptations such as this may be useful in developing                 strategies in this drought ridden and rapidly changing part of                  the world.  The project will also assist in the training of a                   very promising young scientist.",
