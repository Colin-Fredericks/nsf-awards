 "awd_abstract_narration": "The gastrointestinal tract is a dynamic, chemosensory endocrine                 organ that integrates feeding behavior, digestion, absorption, and              assimilation. This proposal requests support for a one day                      symposium to examine how that integration is mediated by hormones.              Entitled \"Comparative Gastrointestinal Endocrinology: Integration               of Function,\" the symposium will be part of the American Society                for Zoologists annual meeting held in Vancouver, B.C. in December               1992. The symposium has three objectives. First, the ten speakers               will examine how the separate processes they investigate contribute             to the regulation of the whole digestive system. Second, examples               of the hormonal control of gut function will come from animal                   groups ranging from mammals to insects. Third, the symposium will               emphasize hormone actions, rather than gut hormone chemistry. The               outcome should lead to: 1) an evaluation of the integrative roles               of regulatory  factors for which functions are known; 2) strategies             for determining the actions of \"orphaned\" chemical mediators,                   having known structures but unknown functions; 3) knowledge of                  interactions between gut peptides and hormones released at sites                remote from the gut; and 4) an assessment of optimal biological                 models in nonmammalian vertebrates and invertebrates, for                       simplifying regularity complexity and for constructing the                      phylogeny of endocrine regulation.",
