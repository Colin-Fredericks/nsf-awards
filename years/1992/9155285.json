 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, PA, in                   collaboration with the Girl Scouts of the United States of                      America, the largest voluntary organization for girls in the                    world, requests NSF support for the National Science Partnership                for Girl Scout Councils and Science Museums.  This three-year                   project establishes partnerships between seven Girl Scout                       councils and six science-technology museums in six regions                      across the nation to promote science interest and knowledge in                  young American women.  The project provides hands-on science                    activity kits and training workshops for Girl Scout leaders that                assist them in conducting science activities with their troops.                 The science activities are directly linked to the existing Girl                 Scout badge program and help Brownie and Junior Girl Scouts                     (ages 8-11) fulfill science-related badge requirements.  Each                   council/museum partnership will develop a specific program that                 involves the local underserved populations in Girl Scout science                activities.  during the three years of federal support, the                     National Science Partnership will develop a specific program                    that involves the local underserved populations in Girl Scout                   science activities.  During the three years of federal support,                 the National Science Partnership will directly serve 11,500                     leaders and 138,000 Girl Scouts.  Extensive project                             dissemination will encourage the involvement of new partnerships                and the institutionalization of the National Science Partnership                by GSUSA, councils, science museums, and other formal education                 organizations so that the project has the potential to reach the                more than 2.3 million Girl Scouts and 780,000 leaders across the                United States.",
