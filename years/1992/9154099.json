 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of video images will be produced that can be used                      in a variety of formats to enhance student-teacher and                          student-subject matter interactions in chemistry education.                     The video, which extends the range of video images shown on                     the Periodic Table Videodisc produced by the same                               developers, will show primarily chemicals, their reactions                      and their practical applications.  These videodiscs will                        allow a great deal of descriptive chemistry to be introduced                    into beginning courses in an interesting way.  In addition,                     some hard-to-visualize theoretical constructs of chemistry                      will be included.  Historically important people, artifacts,                    experiments and documents will be shown including the                           contributions of those from groups underrepresented in                          chemistry.  The completed images will be distributed,                           probably on videodisc, through Journal of Chemical                              Education:  Software and will also be available for future                      publication in other formats.  Example lessons based on the                     published videodiscs in both computer-interactive and stand                     alone modes will be provided.  The materials will be                            suitable for use in grades 8-12 and also in introductory                        courses in two and four year colleges.",
