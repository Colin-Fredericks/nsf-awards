 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glycophorins are among the best studied mammalian integral                    membrane proteins, and yet, very little is known about their                    functions or about the regulation of expression of variant                      glycophorin forms.  This research will focus primarily on the                   development of approaches to the study of expression and function               of glycophorin. A transfection system will be developed for high                levels of cell surface expression of the introduced gene in NIH/3T3             cells.  The establishment of such a system will make it possible to             test hypothesized roles of sialoglycoproteins in the cell.                                                                                                      The long term goal of this project is to establish more detailed                information on the basic biology of glycophorins as membrane                    proteins.  Glycophorins are collectively the major class of                     sialoglycoprotein on the surface of mature red blood cells, and are             extremely well characterized in terms of protein and carbohydrate               chemistry.  Glycophorin has been implicated as a factor in a number             of diseases (e.g., as the receptor for entry of malaria parasites               into the erythrocyte).  Surprisingly, very little is known of its               function(s) in the cell.  These studies, if successful, will pave               the way toward understanding the biology of glycophorins.",
