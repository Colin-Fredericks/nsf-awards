Rao, Professor, Solid                              State and Structural Chemistry Unit, Indian                                     Institute of Science, Bangalore, and J.M. Honig,                                Materials Research Center, Purdue University.  The                              research will continue development of novel oxide                               materials with special attention to high temperature                            superconductors.  The research includes synthesis of                            interesting oxide systems and examination of                                    structure-property relations. Included are selected                             studies of high Tc 214-oxide superconductors with                               the K2NiF4 structure and related normal properties                              of this class of materials.                                                                                                                                     Scope:                                                                          The collaboration of Professor Rao's team at                                    Bangalore and Professor Honig's team at Purdue has                              been successful and resulted in a number of                                     significant publications.  Rao is one of India's                                most distinguished scientists.  He has done                                     pioneering research in numerous areas of materials                              and structural chemistry.  It is likely that this                               project will result in significant advances in                                  the field of new materials and better material                                  characterization.  Dr. Honig is a participant in a                              newly established Indiana Center for Innovative                                 Superconductivity Technology, which was provided                                $500,000 for the first year of operation by the                                 State of Indiana.  His work with Dr. Rao would fit                              well with the objectives of that center, and with                               enhancing materials science research in the U.S.",
