 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our previous study of the paleoenvironments of the                         southwestern margin of the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway used              a joint investigation of clay minerals and foraminifera to yield                some new ideas on the interaction of sedimentation, tectonics,                  climate and oceanography on a regional scale.  Specifically, we                 have been able to discriminate between eustatic and climatic                    influences on sediment distribution during the Late Cretaceous, and             we have correlated changes in source area and circulation patterns              to foraminiferal populations.  In this study, we intend to expand               the scope of our scrutiny to more rigorously evaluate short-term                changes in depositional conditions, water-column stratification,                and the development of oxygen-minimum zones at a proximal basin                 locality spanning the upper Cenomanian to basal Campanian (Mesa                 Verde, CO).  The principal methods to be used will be sedimentary               geochemistry (Fe, Mn, S, CaCO3, TOC and Rock-Eval pyrolysis)                    coupled with foraminiferal population and shape studies, and                    integrated into the detailed stratigraphy gathered previously                   during two field seasons.  Moreover, we will correlate the                      environments at this site to those at a neritic basin site (Lohali              Point, AZ) further west where we have a detailed section from the               Cenomanian to the upper Turonian.  This will provide us with the                basis for comparing conditions in this nearshore locale with those              that have been documented for distal basin sites to the east, (such             as at Pueblo, CO) and will enable us to reconstruct the                         comprehensive paleoceanography of this southwestern sector of the               Western Interior Seaway.",
