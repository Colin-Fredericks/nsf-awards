 "awd_abstract_narration": "A zinc-finger is an independent polypeptide structural unit                     that is shaped by the co-ordination of a  zinc atom.  Hundreds                  of genes for potential zinc finger proteins have been                           identified in the genomes of eukaryotes.  Yet the function of                   only a tiny fraction of these is known or can be predicted.  To                 learn more about the recognition of RNA by zinc finger proteins                 Xenopus TFIIIA and p43 will be altered by recombinant means.                    These proteins have a similar organization of nine zinc                         fingers, yet TFIIIA binds specifically to RNA and DNA, whereas                  p43 binds only to RNA.  Mutant zinc finger proteins will be                     constructed in which amino acids or groups of amino aids from                   DNA-binding zinc fingers will be replaced with amino acids from                 the corresponding position in RNA-bindings zinc fingers and                     their affinity for RNA and DNA will be compared.  As a                          preliminary to designing sequence-specific RNA-binding                          proteins, mutant proteins will be synthesized in which the                      order of zinc fingers has been changed.  To identify the RNA                    substrates of these mutants, oligonucleotides containing a                      random sequence will be transcribed to produced a population of                 RNA substrates.  RNA molecules that bind to the mutant proteins                 will be selected, amplified and sequenced.                                      %%%                                                                             Many essential cellular functions are controlled through proteins               that bind to RNA or DNA.  One class of these proteins contains a                protein structure call a 'zinc finger'  -- a loop of amino acids                shaped into a finger-like structure by the coordination of a zinc               atom.  Zinc fingers mediate protein binding to DNA and RNA.                     However, the molecular features that allow some zinc fingers to                 distinguish RNA and others DNA are unknown.  This research seeks to             understand the molecular basis for selectivity of zinc finger                   containing proteins for RNA or DNA.  Two zinc finger proteins,                  TFIIIA and p4, provide and excellent model system for this study,               because these proteins have a similar organization of nine zinc                 fingers, yet TFIIIA binds to both RNA and DNA, whereas p43 binds                only to RNA.  Therefore, the differences and similarities between               these two proteins should enable us to learn which features of the              zinc finger are  needed for interaction with RNA and which features             of the zinc finger are needed for interaction with RNA and which                DNA.  Using recombinant DNA technology to synthesize hybrids of                 TFIIIA and p43 in which different zinc fingers or parts of zinc                 fingers have been combined, the specificity and affinity of                     individual zinc fingers for RNA and DNA will  be measured.  These               studies will lay the groundwork for designing protein molecules                 that bind to specific RNA sequences or structures.  Such molecules              could form the basis for a new class of therapeutic agents that may             be able to block RNA function, for example by inhibiting                        translation of a specific messenger RNA into protein.",
