 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Russell will conduct archaeological excavations at the site                 of Cerro Mayal which is located in the Chicama Valley of northern               coastal Peru.  The site, which dates to Moche times, consists of                a ceramics workshop, a ca. 5000 square meter area with numerous                 piles of wasted ceramics which protrude up to one meter above the               ground surface.  Also associated with this is a habitation area                 where the remains of buildings of both masonry and adobe brick                  architecture can be discerned.  During a single season of                       fieldwork, Dr. Russell and colleagues will excavate in the                      workshop area to identify the spatial organization of features                  and artifacts.  They hope to reconstruct the ceramic technology                 and associated labor organization.  Dr. Russell will also dig in                the waste pile area to recover tools, molds and partially                       competed vessels.  Finally, he will focus on the habitation zone                associated with the workshop.  He hopes to learn how this group                 was organized and how the products were distributed over a                      broader area.  Dr. Russell will also conduct laboratory analysis                of clays and ceramic materials from both Cerro Mayal as well as                 other Chicama Valley sites in an attempt to reconstruct the trade               network.                                                                                                                                                        The Chicama Valley served as the focus for the Moche culture                    which built monumental architecture in the form of temples and                  associated habitation complexes.  They also produced fine craft                 items.  The Moche spread over a large area, controlled large                    numbers of people and dug and administered an extensive system of               canals which captured water from the Andes Mountains and                        permitted agriculture in this extremely dry desert environment.                 It is unclear how large societies such as this arise and are                    maintained and many archaeologists believe that control of                      manufacturing and trade play an important role in this process.                 Cerro Mayal is important because its large size suggests that                   pottery production was under centralized control.  This research                will help to determine whether this hypothesis is correct.                                                                                                      The project will produce data of interest to many archaeologists                and will increase our understanding of how complex societies                    arise and are maintained.",
