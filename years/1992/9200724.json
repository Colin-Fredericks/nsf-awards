 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the present classification for fungi, the Basidiomycota and                  Ascomycota are classified on the basis of the \"whole fungus\" (i.e.,             the vegetative and reproductive structures, with the latter                     weighted) whereas the Deuteromycota were form taxa based on                     relatively few, usually artificial, characters.  This problem,                  which will be addressed  in the workshop, \"Higher Fungal                        Classification,\" was clearly enunciated by Thomas Bruns, \"If all                fungi can be compared through their nucleic acids and placed on a               single phylogenetic tree, do we need to maintain the                            Deuteromycetes?\"  Clearly from a scientific perspective the answer              is an unqualified \"yes.  This taxonomic solution for these asexual              forms will be most feasible and practical if the phylogeny of the               basidiomycetes and ascomycetes has been solidly based on rigorous               methods of data collection and analysis.  Various laboratories in               the U.S.A. have initiated studies that incorporate detailed                     analyses of macro- and microcharacters of the phenotype, molecular              sequence data, and cladistic algorithms to develop those                        phylogenies; however, it appears that protocol has not spread as                widely as is necessary to complete this endeavor.  Therefore, this              workshop could have a secondary effect---the continued spread of                molecular techniques in the study of phylogenetic relationships                 within the fungal kingdom.",
