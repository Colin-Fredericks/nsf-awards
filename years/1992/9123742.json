 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project continues work on inverse boundary problems and                their application to inverse scattering theory.  Inverse problems               are common in physical experiments where one only knows the                     outcome of some process and tries to determine the physical                     parameters which could produce such a result.  In this work, one                seeks the coefficients of a partial differential equation from                  knowledge of the associated map taking Dirichlet data (boundary                 values) to Neumann data (boundary flux).  Inverse problems have                 clear applications to electric current tomography.  In addition,                it is an example of how specific applications can lead to new                   methods, which then lead to new and unexpected theoretical                      developments.                                                                        In the present context, the new method is the use of                       exponential solutions of elliptic partial differential equations.               It may be viewed as an elliptic analogue of geometrical optics.                 The method has led to major advances in inverse scattering  and                 several other, related problems.  It is now beginning to yield                  results on problems involving systems (such as Maxwell's                        equations) rather than scalar equations.  The success of this                   viewpoint for elliptic problems has also spurred work on                        analogous questions for hyperbolic equations.                                        The goals for future work involve further exploration of the               global uniqueness question in two dimensions (a major concern in                all inverse problems, with two dimensions being the most                        difficult) and further progress on systems such as Maxwell's                    equations or those of elasticity.",
