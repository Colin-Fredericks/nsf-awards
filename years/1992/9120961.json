 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neurotransmitters and hormones are synthesized in specialized                   tissues and are secreted from the cells of those tissues in                     response to environmental stimuli.  When secreted, these molecules              provide signals to other cells which enable these cells to adapt to             the physiological conditions.  The requirements of the cell for                 increased or decreased amounts of transmitter or hormone changes                with the environmental status of the organism.  The synthesis of                neurotransmitters and hormones is catalyzed by enzymes which are                present only in those cells destined to secrete the                             neurotransmitter or hormone.  The focus of this study is to                     understand the mechanism of biosynthesis of the enzyme which                    catalyzes the synthesis of norepinephrine, a hormone and                        neurotransmitter which is important for cardiovascular function and             adaptation to stress.  This enzyme, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, is               localized to the cellular secretory granule, which is the                       compartment which stores the neurotransmitter.  Within this                     compartment, the enzyme is in two forms; one form is in the soluble             contents of this granule, while the other form is attached to the               membrane which forms the boundary of the granule.  This research                project will study the biochemical differences between                          these two forms which are important for the different                           localizations.  An antisera will be prepared which specifically                 recognizes amino acid residue, which may be present in the                      membrane-bound, but not the soluble portion of the protein.  This               antisera will be used to monitor the presence of this segment on                two forms of the protein.  The results of these experiments may                 uncover a novel mechanism of protein biogenesis.",
