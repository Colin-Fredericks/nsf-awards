 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will write a review essay on the economics of                  science that will serve as the basis for a workshop discussion                  among a group of eight scholars from economics and STS                          disciplines.  The day-long workshop will consist of three or four               sessions focusing on broad questions of the application of                      economics to science issues.  Possible session topics are:  \"The                Maximizing Model Applied to Science,\" \"The Organization of                      Scientific Inquiry,\" and \"The Allocation of Scarce Resources.\"                  The review essay, written responses to the review essay, and                    perhaps other readings suggested by participants, will be                       distributed before the workshop and will serve as the common                    starting point for the discussions.  Based on comments and the                  workshop discussion, the investigator will revise and submit the                review essay for publication.  Participants will submit their                   thoughts on whether further research in economics of science is                 promising and, if so, what questions it should seek to answer.                  The investigator will also compile these results in a form                      suitable for publication.  The purpose of the project is to allow               exchanges to occur between scholars with overlapping research                   agendas and complementary research methods.  Results should lead                to deeper and more useful understanding of the behavior of                      scientists and organization of the scientific enterprise, and to                identification of areas where collaboration will be fruitful.  It               may help to form a new subfield of scholars who specialize in the               study of the economics of science, whose issues range from the                  cognitive status of scientific knowledge to the efficient                       allocation of scientific funds.",
