 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical weathering is of fundamental importance because it is the              process by which silicate minerals formed at high-temperatures and              pressures are converted to the constituents of sediments and soils.             Despite this, the structural and compositional controls on the                  mechanisms and rates of transformations of many reactions are still             poorly understood.  This proposal describes two research projects               designed to use high-resolution transmission electron microscopy                to investigate the microscopic characteristics of weathering                    reactions where significant structural exists between the parent                and product minerals.  The first of these involves hydration and                oxidation of amphibole-group minerals.  The second project focuses              on perovskite weathering, where hydrous minerals are not formed and             oxidation does not occur.                                                       The weathering reactions of a selection of microstructurally                    complex amphiboles with close to end-member compositions,                       intergrown and exsolved amphiboles, and amphiboles containing                   chain-width defects will be examined.  Intergrown amphiboles offer              the opportunity to compare weathering rates and mechanisms under                the same physiochemical conditions and to evaluate the degree to                which reactions are focused by coherency strain, defects, and grain             boundaries.  The Weathering of perovskite will also be examined.                Hydrothermal dissolution of perovskite, a possible component of                 nuclear waste storage ceramics, has been studied extensively, but               the natural weathering reactions have been largely ignored.  The                chemically simple transformation to TiO2 minerals may involve                   considerable structural inheritance.  The aims these projects are               to clarify the crystal chemical details of the natural weathering               processes, thus enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms by                which these reactions occur.",
