 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will support an                       investigation that will pursue the underpinnings and implications               of the coevolution to the edge of chaos, based on entirely novel                models of molecules or goods as symbol strings which act on one                 another to produce new symbol strings according to a \"random                    grammar\".  The principal investigator seeks new insights into how               complex adaptive systems collaborate, compete, and coevolve. In                 particular, the investigator expects to find new models of                      economic take-off based on achieving a sufficient diversity of                  goods and services in an economy. Similar concepts will apply to                ecosystem structure. Most broadly, it is hoped that investigation               of random grammars will yield insight into the self organized                   behaviors of far from equilibrium systems.                                                                                                                      Among the fundamental phenomena in biology and beyond, in                       economic and cultural systems, is the coevolution of complex                    adaptive systems. In the past few years, work carried out on                    diverse fronts by a small number of physicists, biologists,                     mathematicians, and economists, has begun to suggest a broad new                conceptual framework and candidate universal features of such                   coevolution: Complex coevolving systems may evolve the the edge                 of chaos.  The new theory is built upon the recognition that such               coevolving systems, whether symbionts or interlocked firms,                     mutually build the world they jointly inhabit. Such                             coevolutionary systems can behave in three regimes. The first is                a chaotic regime, where each adaptive agent struggles to improve                on multipeaked \"fitness landscapes\" which deform so rapidly due                 to moves of other agents that no agent comes to rest. This regime               is called the Arms Race in evolutionary biology. The ordered                    regime occurs when all agents climb to local fitness peaks that                 are mutually consistent. Adaptive chance ceases. The third regime               is the boundary between order and chaos. Two new facts have                     emerged: 1) Mean fitness, or \"payoff\" is low in both the chaotic                regime and in the ordered regime and is optimal at the edge of                  chaos. 2) A kind of \"invisible hand\" can act such that each agent               tunes the structure of its own landscape and couplings to other                 landscapes to its own advantage, and by doing so the entire                     system coevolves to the phase transition between order and chaos.               If generally true, the implications are broad. We must consider                 that adaptive agents mutually alter the games we play with one                  another, in evolution, in economies, and perhaps elsewhere, to a                characteristic poised state between order and disorder.                         Signatures of this poised state include a power law distribution                of avalanches of change initiated by small perturbations. Just                  such a distribution of sizes of extinction events in the                        evolutionary Record are known. Similar avalanches may occur in                  technological evolution.",
