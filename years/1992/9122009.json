 "awd_abstract_narration": "Indigenous people control significant amounts of biological                     diversity and knowledge about that biodiversity.  They are                      important sources of knowledge and resources.  Deforestration and               genetic erosion threaten these sources.  While industrial countries             have implemented intellectual property protection through                       legislation and regulation, these formulas are not easily extended              to indigenous knowledge.  This scholarly conference on the                      relations between intellectual property and indigenous knowledge                will bring together both advocates and disinterested specialists to             discuss topics covering the nature of intellectual property regimes             and indigenous knowledge, the benefits and drawbacks of extending               intellectual property, the interests involved, and alternative                  approaches to protecting the rights, knowledge, and biological                  resources of indigenous peoples.  Thorough discussion of these                  themes requires participation from specialists on national and                  international policies and administration of biological resources,              indigenous groups and advocates, users of biological resources,                 legal scholars familiar with indigenous rights issues and                       intellectual property, and ethnobotonists.  The primary criteria in             selecting participants are their familiarity with the issues and                the expectation that they will contribute a significant scholarly               paper on their topic.  Papers commissioned from each of the 25 or               so conference participants will be presented and circulated two                 months prior to the conference.  After each presentation at the                 conference, two pre-assigned discussants will respond prior to open             discussion.  The six days will include three days of presentations              and discussions, and two days for work group preparations of                    summary reports on the conference themes.  One day will be devoted              to a final plenary session and conference closure.  Results will                include scholarly publications and reports in the newsletters and               journals of appropriate professional, scientific and stakeholder                organizations.",
