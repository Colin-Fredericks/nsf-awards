 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative                      research in galactic astronomy involving Thomas Troland,                        University of Kentucky, Richard Crutcher, University of Illinois,               and Ilya Kazes at the Observatoire de Meudon in France.  The                    investigators propose to continue their successful research on                  magnetic field strengths in the evolution of interstellar clouds and            star formation.  Magnetic fields have emerged as a mechanism for                explaining star formation and other cosmic phenomena.  The only                 known technique for measuring magnetic field strength is detection              of the Zeeman effect in radio frequency spectral lines.                                                                                                         The U.S. and French investigators will continue their survey                    observations of the OH Zeeman effect of dark clouds using the                   VLA (Very Large Array), Green Bank and the Arecibo telescopes.                  They will extend their research to denser regions by observing the              Zeeman effect in the 3-mm lines of CN using the IRAM 30-m                       telescope.  This experiment will allow direct probing of magnetic               fields at a crucial stage in star formation when core fragmentation             and collapse are taking place.  Observations with the IRAM                      telescope is essential since its collecting area is sizeable and will           allow for observations in denser regions of space.  The project will            benefit from French expertise in observation and access to the                  IRAM facility in Europe.  Through the observational program, the                investigators will be able to test fundamental theories of magnetic             fields in interstellar clouds and enhance our understanding of the              role of magnetic fields in star formation.",
