 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Piedmont of the Southern Appalachians has been shown to                involve major overthrusts of crystalline rocks, possibly due to                 crustal delamination, but have also been shown to have evidence for             major extensional features of the Piedmont in the southern                      Appalachians is therefore controversial, with competing models                  having the same terranes both autochthonous with respect to North               America and exotic, and having major boundary faults extensional                in one model, compressional in another with strike-slip motion in               a third.  This collaborative, field-based project centers on                    establishing the history of the more important terranes and their               bounding faults.  The work involves mapping, petrology and age                  dating within the Belair, Savannah River and Carolina terranes near             Macon, Georgia, and on the Modoc fault which separates the Carolina             and Savannah River terranes.  Results are expected to resolve                   points of major disagreement among current tectonic models and                  provide a further means of testing the fundamentally important                  hypothesis that crustal delamination occurred at the onset of the               late Paleozoic Alleghanian orogeny.",
