 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide variety of plants, marine or estuarine animals,                          microorganisms and certain cells in the tissues of higher animals               (gut, kidneys, etc.) show resistance to salt stress (highly                     concentrated salt solutions) by using a variety of small molecular              weight, electrically neutral organic molecules as intracellular                 osmotic buffers. The mechanism of drought resistance is closely                 tied to the mechanism of salt stress resistance. Cells that cannot              regulate these organic solute concentrations are not salt stress                resistant. The proposed research builds on previous work and                    focuses on the mechanisms used by cells to regulate the                         intracellular concentration of these organic solutes. We propose                that production and metabolic turnover of these solutes are                     compartmentalized within intracellular organelles such as the                   mitochondria and/or chloroplasts and that the rest of the cell                  serves as the compartment of accumulation. Using gill tissue from               a highly salt stress resistant bivalve mollusc as a model system,               we plan to identify the elements (enzymes) regulating production of             these solutes in the mitochondria and study how the cell controls               the regulation of these elements so as to adjust the internal                   osmotic pressure of the cell to be more or less equal to that of                the media bathing cell. The research involves use of a variety of               analytical chemical equipment, radiochemical tracers, some tissue               culture studies, enzymatic assays and the separation of metabolic               elements using various centrifugation, chromatographic,                         electrophoretic, and antibody precipitation techniques for specific             analysis. The result will be a better understanding of the                      mechanisms of cellular salt stress resistance and the physiological             controls regulating these processes.",
