 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated device capable of performing edge and motion                      detection in real time for image processing system is to be built.              The device is based on the \"silicon retina\" of Carver Mead, but                 adds optical outputs, allowing the preprocessed images to be fed                directly to further optical parallel processing stages.  These                  \"retinas\" are VLSI (very large scale integration) implementations               of neural networks which duplicate many of the functions of the                 vertebrate retina.  The technology used here, the addition of                   ferroelectric liquid crystal light modulators to standard CMOS                  (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) VLSI, can utilize the                 full repertoire of VLSI electronic functionality including                      photodetection, and can be applied to individual die, making for                rapid research iterations and the economical application to custom              products.  its 104Hz readout rate is accomplished with minimal                  power dissipation, and is more than fast enough for neural image                processing.                                                                                                                                                     The work focuses on developing techniques for isolating read light              from write light in these completely optically interconnected                   devices, and on developing retinal binocular images.  The device                should have many commercial applications for example, in the fields             of optical inspection and robotics.",
