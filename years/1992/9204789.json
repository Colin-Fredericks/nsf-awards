 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's goal is to provide data critical to                         understanding vertebrate faunal evolution during the Late Triassic,             which includes the origin of mammals as well as other major                     tetrapod groups (e.g., dinosaurs, turtles, crocodylomorphs,                     Pterosaurs).  Although major originations took place during this                time, almost half of known Late Triassic tetrapod families became               extinct by the Early Jurassic.  The temporal, taxonomic and                     geographic extent of this faunal turnover has been debated,                     principally because well-dated, fossiliferous rock sequences are                rare.  The Late Triassic Fleming Fjord Formation offers a greater               range of stratigraphic and lithologic exposures (representing                   lacustrine, fluviatile  and subaerial environments) than those in               which Late Triassic faunas have previously been found.  The Fleming             Fjord fauna is now known to include a substantial representation of             European taxa, including prosauropod (Plateosaurus) and theropod                dinosaurs, a turtle (Proganochelys), an aetosaur (Aetosaurus                    ferratus), a pterosaur (Eudimorphodon), plagiosaurid (Gerrothorax)              and capitosauroid (cf. Mastodonsaurus) amphibians, as well as other             taxa (a phytosaur, sharks, lungfish, and semionotids).  The Fleming             Fjord fauna is potentially a key biostratigraphic link between                  continental sediments of Europe and North America.                                   Evidence of one of the earliest known mammals has been found               in the Fleming Fjord Formation.  Only the scantiest record of                   mammalian evolution has been found prior to the Early Jurassic.                 The cranial and postcranial anatomy of Late Triassic mammals is                 little understood with the result that current phylogenetic                     hypotheses suffer from a lack of substantive evidence.  At the end              of the 1991 season four fossiliferous horizons were discovered in               the upper Fleming Fjord Formation; these quarry sites, together                 with investigation of new, recently identified areas for                        prospecting, hold great promise for producing additional material               of mammals as well as other constituents of this fauna.",
