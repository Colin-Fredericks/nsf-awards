 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is directed towards finding classification                algorithms that are trained from examples and achieve good                      generalization performance.  A new training procedure is                        investigated that adjusts the complexity of the classifier to the               problem at hand in order to optimize the tradeoff between perfect               memorization and good generalization.  The new algorithm applies                to a large variety of classification functions, including                       polynomial classifiers, two layer neural networks, or radial basis              functions.  Initial experiments on optical character recognition                problems demonstrate both its performance relative to other                     learning algorithms, and its efficiency regarding time and memory               requirements.  Topics for investigation include the estimation of               the VC dimension of the resulting classifiers, and the study of the             relationship between VC dimension and generalization performance                on a wide variety of problems in order to obtain a robust algorithm             that performs well even when no expert knowledge in the training                procedure to further improve performance will be considered.  the               ability of the algorithm to find atypical, misclassified, or                    meaningless, or misclassified patterns will be investigated to                  automatically clean databases.",
