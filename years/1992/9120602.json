Takeuchi of the                   Chemistry Department, State University of New York at Buffalo.                  New complexes will be synthesized which utilize tertiary                        phosphine ligands, cis-chelating ligands, trans-spanning                        ligands, and macrocyclic bis(dioximato) ligands.  A variety of                  steric and electronic environments will be created around the                   metal by use of these ligands.  The kinetics and mechanism of                   the oxidation of alcohol, amine, and sulfide substrates will be                 studied in detail, for the purpose of monitoring the                            sensitivity of the catalyst to these environmental changes.  In                 addition, ruthenium(II) aquo complexes of these ligands will be                 prepared and their substitution and aerobic oxidation reactions                 with alkenes will be investigated.                                              %%%                                                                             Ruthenium(IV)oxo complexes have been found to serve as                          effective catalysts for the oxidation of certain organic                        compounds.  Previously, Takeuchi has determined the details of                  action of some complexes of this type.  Here, the complexes                     will be modified and their catalytic activity tested to                         determine if the activity of the catalyst can be controlled to                  give specific products under predetermined conditions.",
