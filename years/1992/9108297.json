 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to undertake the                      first comprehensive thermal studies of vertical-cavity                          surface-emitting semiconductor lasers and two-dimensional                       laser arrays.  Although there is a general consensus that                       thermal problems are of utmost importance for vertical-cavity                   surface emitters, they remain virtually unexplored.  The                        underlying goal of this project is to reach a good                              understanding of main factors which govern the thermal                          behavior of vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser and to use                   this knowledge to improve the device performance.  In the                       initial phase of the project, we will concentrate on studies                    of individual surface-emitting lasers.  We will develop a                       thermal-electrical self-consistent model, with realistic                        distribution of heat sources and accounting for two-                            dimensional current- and heat spreading, and apply it to                        several types of state-of-the-art vertical cavity laser                         structures.  We will also examine impact of thermal effects in                  individual emitters on their integration into two-dimensional                   arrays.  The thermal-electrical self-consistency will then be                   complemented by inclusion of optical phenomena and fully self-                  consistent treatment will be developed to examine effects of                    heating on optical properties of individual surface emitters                    and two-dimensional arrays.  The proposed research is expected                  to provide important information for advanced design of high-                   performance vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers and two-                    dimensional arrays for novel applications such as optical                       processing and optical interconnects.",
