This  instrument will be equipped for                          computer-controlled X-ray diffraction in both wide angle and                    small angle modes, complete with control and data processing                    software, for use in diffraction analysis of powders, fibers,                   and films.  The areas of chemical research that will be                         enhanced by the acquisition are the following:                                                                                                                  1)  Crystallinity studies of materials for the construction of                      energy efficient membranes used in organic and azeotropic                       liquid separation;                                                                                                                                          2)  Structural characterization of membrane mimetic systems                         for energy conversion;                                                                                                                                      3)  Crystallinity and morphology characterization of composite                      materials such as polymer alloys and blends, and surfaces                       of catalysts;                                                                                                                                               4)  Crystal structure analysis of fibrous polymers used in                          membranes and polymers blends;                                                                                                                              5)  Crystal structure analysis of polymers used in enhanced                         oil recovery programs.                                                                                                                                      Single crystal X-ray is the most powerful analytical method for                 structure determination of solids.  In synthetic inorganic,                     organic, bioinorganic and organometallic chemistry, single                      crystal X-ray diffraction is an invaluable tool to characterize                 molecular structure.  The information gained from the knowledge                 of the intermolecular composition and structure helps to                        develop new reactions of potentially general interest in                        catalysis or organic synthesis.",
