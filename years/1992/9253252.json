 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an effort to increase both the use of technology and actual                  data in education, this project will utilize computers and CD-                  ROM technology to bring scientific data and curriculum                          material developed by NASA, NOAA, and USGS in the Joint                         Education Initiative (JEdI) Project into the classroom.  The                    use of these materials will allow teachers and students to                      investigate their own questions relating to global and                          astronomical phenomena.                                                                                                                                         Scientists that help develop the CD-ROM discs, university                       faculty, and industry personnel will serve as mentors                           assisting teachers on the access and use of government data                     and in its instructional application.  Two hundred and twenty-                  five teachers from around the country will be trained during                    the three year project which runs from September 1, 1992                        through August 31, 1995.  Training will occur at the                            University of Maryland (College Park) and Western Washington                    University.  Another 660 teachers will receive training from                    lead teachers, increasing the total number of teachers reached                  in the project to 885.  There will be an approximate cost                       share of 27%.",
