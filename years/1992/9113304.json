 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a complex of genes                located close together on a single chromosome.  The MHC, or a                   complex much like it, is found in probably all vertebrates.  An                 extraordinary feature of the MHC in humans and mice and possibly                many other species is that it is by far the most variable part of               the entire genome.  This extreme genetic diversity among                        individuals reflects the role of the MHC in controlling the                     immune system.                                                                                                                                                  Research by Yamazaki and his colleagues shows that the MHC may                  function in behavior in ways that strongly affect the frequency                 of various MHC genes in populations.  Male mice of certain inbred               strains tend to avoid mating with other mice carrying the same                  MHC genes as their own, a phenomenon known as disassortative                    mating.  Because close relatives tend to carry the same genes,                  disassortative mating would tend to favor unrelated individuals                 as mates.  These MHC preferences of males are learned and can be                reversed by rearing pups with an appropriate foster mother.                                                                                                     Dr. Brown's research is concerned with understanding how the MHC                affects behavior and populations at a behavioral level.                         Preliminary work in his laboratory using other strains of mice                  confirms disassortative mating based on MHC genes, but with                     female choice and not male choice of mates.  In this project, he                will determine if wild mice can employ MHC-coded odors in                       choosing a mate, and if these mice learn their preferences for                  MHC types from their rearing associates, primarily the nursing                  mother.  Other work suggests that wild mice are more choosy in                  mating that the inbred mice used by Yamazaki and by Brown; Brown                will measure the difference in choosiness between wild and inbred               strains.  This research project will help to estimate how strong                a role is played by the MHC in avoiding inbreeding in wild mice.                In general, the project will help to explain both genetic and                   environmental determinants of mating preference in mammals.",
