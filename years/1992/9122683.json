These                    disputes typically presume a conception of scientific knowledge                 as a body of representations whose content and relation to the                  world must be explained, whether by reasons and evidence                        \"internal\" to science, or \"external\" social and practical                       embodiment of scientific knowledge and its temporal dynamics.                   Dr. Rouse believes that these disputes oversimplify and distort                 the political and cultural significance of the sciences in their                attempt to vindicate or challenge the legitimacy of the                         scientific enterprise.  Dr. Rouse is attempting to develop a more               adequate account of these aspects of the sciences, using his                    account to criticize directly the concepts of the \"content\" of                  scientific knowledge and the \"ontological status\" of its objects                which are at issue in the rationality and realism disputes.  He                 aims to show how the positions in these disputes derive their                   apparent significance from their place within what he sees as                   problematic cultural conflicts over the \"legitimacy of the modern               age.\"",
