 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally, the American legal system has operated on the                    presumption that both sides in a lawsuit will pay their own                     litigation costs, the bulk of which is likely to be attorney fees.              This \"pay your own way\" procedure is known as the \"American rule\"               because the so-called \"English rule,\" in which the losing party in              a lawsuit pays the expenses of the winner, is much more common in               other Westernized countries.  Underneath the issue of who pays the              cost of litigation lie profound questions about the role of the                 legal system in American society.  On one side are those who                    perceive that Americans are excessively litigious and support a                 loser-pays rule assuming it would deter frivolous claims and                    defenses.  On the other side, however, are those who focus on                   Americans who are hardly litigious but in fact are excluded from                using the legal system because of inability to pay the costs                    required.  These persons' support or opposition to laws that shift              legal fees from one party to another would depend on their                      likelihood of increasing \"access to justice\" for legitimate claims.                                                                                             The empirical research question underlying this controversy is                  whether fee-shifting laws do in fact affect people's decisions to               litigate.  The purpose of this planning grant is to develop a                   research design for examining the effects of statutes that shift                the costs of litigation, especially attorney fees, to losing                    parties.  The investigator will adopt a sociolegal perspective on               outcomes which would require a combination of aggregate and case-               level analysis, including disputant surveys.  Fee-shifting statutes             will be reviewed and interviews will be conducted about the                     implementation of such statutes.  This work will provide the basis              for the ultimate selection of jurisdictions for a comparative study             of outcomes in jurisdictions with and without fee-shifting.  The                research design in the full proposal will test the economic and the             socio-cultural models of litigation against the behavior of                     disputants with an opportunity to shift their legal fees to the                 other party.                                                                                                                                                    This research will be of considerable policy relevance as well as               add to scientific knowledge about how the change of the fee                     structure in the legal system can affect the quantity and quality               of litigation.  The findings will contribute to sociolegal research             on claiming and law and economics research on settlement decisions.             The opportunity to compare economic with socio/cultural models of               litigation behavior will be unique.",
