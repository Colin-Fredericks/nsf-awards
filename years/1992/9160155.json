 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research is to develop a precise mathematical              model (based on a piecewise-deterministic Markov process) for the               uncertainties in capacity expansion planning and to study the                   construction of optimal plans with this framework by means of                   stochastic control theory.  To provide a concrete context for the               Phase I work, the research plan is directed toward the specific                 capacity expansion plans faced by electric utilities.  The                      investigator plans to achieve the research goal by: (a) formulating             a representative class of capacity expansion problems using demand              and completion time data from electric utilities; (b) determining               optimal controls or investment strategies for these problems using              analytic and numerical techniques; and, (c) implementing these                  optimization techniques on a computer and generating a set of                   clear, illustrative examples of their effectiveness.                                 Successful completion of these objectives will demonstrate the             feasibility of extending the approach to a prototype capacity                   expansion decision aid.  An optimization technique for generation               expansion planning would have direct application to determining                 reserve margins, adopting new technologies, selecting units sizes,              and ensuring reliability.  In addition, such a technique would                  provide important leverage for addressing complex capacity                      expansion problems in other industries.",
