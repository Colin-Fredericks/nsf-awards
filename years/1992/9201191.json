 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) will design and                 construct a prototype underwater Acoustic Local Area Network (ALAN)             for real-time communication with remote ocean-bottom scientific                 instruments.  The ALAN will rely on a newly developed underwater                acoustic modem that was designed to interface to a wide variety of              oceanographic data acquisition systems, ranging from relatively low             data-rate thermistor or current meter arrays, to high-rate sensors              such as acoustic Doppler current meters and video imaging systems.              The ALAN is conceptually similar to land-based cellular telephone               networks.  It will enable real-time, interactive, long-term,                    offshore monitoring, as well as adaptive sampling and experimental              control.  Data throughput of 10 kilobits/sec is anticipated.  The               operational range will extend 5-10 kilometers from a central                    controller in deep water and up to 100 instruments may be                       eventually accommodated.  The initial test deployment in Monterey               Canyon will consist of a dozen two-way sensors transmitting to a                surface receiver that will have a HF radio link to shore.  The                  capability to receive oceanographic data in real time and                       communicate with remotely deployed data gathering instruments has               long been desired by ocean scientists.  Having this new capability              will open new research opportunities as well.  Investigators from               Northeastern University and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research                  Institute are collaborating on this project.",
