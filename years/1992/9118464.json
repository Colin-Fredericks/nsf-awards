 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to harmful environmental stresses, such as heat and                 viral infection, organisms synthesize proteins called stress                    proteins or heat shock proteins.  Stress proteins may either                    protect organisms from the effects of stress or aid organisms                   during the recovery from stress.  Although stress proteins are                  induced in response to stress, some stress proteins are                         constitutively expressed.  This suggests that stress proteins                   also participate in normal cellular activities.  Stress proteins                may play a role in development, signal transduction, receptor-                  mediated endocytosis, and protein translocation.  The ability of                stress proteins to associate with other proteins suggests that                  they may mediate protein-protein interactions and facilitate                    protein folding and assembly.  Preliminary evidence presented in                this proposal suggests that a cytosolic factor facilitates the                  dissociation of complexes between cytosolic 70K stress proteins                 and other proteins.  During the proposed research I will purify                 and characterize this factor.  The isolation and study of the                   dissociation factor will provide insight into the molecular                     events leading to proper folding and assembly of proteins in                    vivo.",
