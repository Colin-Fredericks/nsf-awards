 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overall, this project addresses three areas of time series                      econometrics and empirical macroeconomics.  The first area                      consists of methodological and empirical issues in business cycle               forecasting.  The second concerns econometric inference about the               long-run properties of economic time series.  The third part of                 the project examines econometric issues about dynamic equilibrium               macroeconomic models.                                                                                                                                           Recent advances in computational technology and data availability               have made it possible to contemplate macroeconomic forecasting                  with literally hundreds of economic time series.  This large                    number of potentially important time series raises important                    methodological issues.  This project addresses empirical and                    methodological issues related to parameter instability, changing                cyclical patterns, and forecasting in high-dimensional systems.                 Economic theory suggests and studies of individual relations                    (such as the money-income relation) provide evidence of                         instability in reduced form forecasts of the business cycle.                    Obtaining a better empirical understanding of this instability is               of interest from the perspectives of both macroeconomic theory                  and economic forecasting.  Understanding whether, how and when                  relations have changed provides an empirical foundation for                     theoretical investigations of macroeconomic dynamics and suggest                ways to develop adaptive forecasting models.                                                                                                                    This project is part of our economics of global change research                 agenda.  It relates to the very high priority goal of developing                forecasting tools for assessing the economic consequences of                    global climate change.  The tools that are now used by government               and industry to make forecasts are subject to serious                           methodological criticisms.  The time series methods developed in                this project could provide much better forecasts of the impacts                 of the types of structural changes in the economy anticipated                   from global warming and from government policies to constrain or                sharply reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.",
