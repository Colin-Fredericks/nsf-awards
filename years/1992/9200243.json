 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort consists of installing a low.end                               McIDASWorkstation in Kuwait City, enabling                                      (asynchronous)communications between the workstation in Kuwait                  and McIDASmainframe facility in Madison, Wisconsin.  It is                      anticipated thatNOAA personnel will dial into the mainframe                     facility and downloaddata on demand.  Besides METEOSAT, other                   data relevant to thedispersal of the smoke are also available via               McIDAS (e.g. NOAA.11 and 12 AVHRR imagery, surface and upper air                data from the Gulfstations, NMC forecast products, etc.), which                 will also beaccessible from Kuwait.  SSEC provided similar                      capability inBahrain in support of the University of Washington                 and NCARaircraft during May and June of this year.                                   A McIDAS workstation located in Kuwait would also be a                     veryuseful research tool.  It would allow the scientists                        locatedthere to investigate the effects of the smoke on the                     localweather including: the effects of the smoke on visibility                  andtemperatures, the predictability of the smoke based on the                   localconditions, the probability of \"black rain\" in the coming                  wintermonths, etc.. The workstation can also provide a means                    ofexporting local data such as those gathered on the 15                         towersinstrumented by NOAA for use by scientists in the US                      through themainframe McIDAS.  Other research opportunities                      include theinvestigation of the impact the smoke has on Kuwait's                environmentas well as the impact of dust storms on local                        activities such asaviation.",
