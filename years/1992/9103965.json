 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed conference will be held in Kona, Hawaii from August                25-27, 1992 as a satelite meeting to the IX International Congress              on Photosynthesis which meets the following week in Nagoya, Japan.              CO2 in the atmosphere has been increasing steadily primarily from               increasing human activities.  If this trend continues, the concern              is that global warming through the so-called \"greenhouse effect\"                will occur and result in severe environment changes.  There is also             concern over depletion of the ozone layer and the resulting                     increased exposure to potentially harmful UV-B radiation.  The                  effects of these and other environmental factors on photosynthetic              capacity and the ability of plants, globally to withstand or                    reverse these trends are of considerable importance to mankind.                 The problem is obviously large and complex.  Yet, fundamental                   mechanisms in photosynthesis offer a way to evaluate the processes              that largely contribute to the ability of plants to successfully                respond to environmental change.  The purpose of the proposed                   conference is to provide a much-needed interdisciplinary forum on               how photosynthesis relates to this problem.  Three dimensions will              be examined: (1) the underlying physiology of photosynthesis, (2)               comparison of terrestial and marine/aquatic systems, and (3) global             responses.  This meeting of interdisciplinary groups should                     stimulate new insights, reveal new research opportunities, both                 disciplinary and interdisciplinary, and open new opportunities for              collaborative research.  These outcomes are especially important                for researchers early in their careers.",
