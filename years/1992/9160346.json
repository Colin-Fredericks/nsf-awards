 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)  Phase 1 project is              in the general area of polymer modification in the subfield of                  organic synthesis.  The selection of a polymer for use in a                     biomedical application is based upon the physical characteristics               of the polymer such as strength and flexibility and upon the                    biocompatibility of the material with tissue.  Often compromises                must be made between these two conflicting requirements.  The                   ideal solution to this problem is to enable the selection of the                polymer based solely on the physical properties and then provide a              tenacious surface coating which imparts the required                            biocompatibility properties.  The coating reagent must be capable               of covalent bonding to a variety of polymer surfaces and imparting              the desired surface properties.                                                                                                                                 This project will focus on the synthesis of new photoreactive                   groups having improved photocoupling capabilities including                     wavelength of activation and reactivity toward less reactive                    polymer surfaces.  These new reagents will be incorporated into                 coating molecules to assess their ability to surface modify the                 polymer.  Two representative coating systems will be                            investigated, one intended to impart a lubricous surface and the                other to generate a nonthrombogenic coating.  A variety of polymer              substrates will be utilized and these reagents will be used to                  coat devices provided by customers.",
