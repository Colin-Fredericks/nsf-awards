 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamentally new course on electricity and magnetism is                      being developed.  The goal of the course is to teach students                   a unified approach to reasoning qualitatively about a wide                      variety of electrical and magnetic interactions.  The students                  then use this approach in the process of solving both                           qualitative and quantitative problems. The qualitative work is                  based on the physics of the basic Coulomb interaction and of                    the atomic structure of matter. This is done initially without                  the use of secondary concepts such as electric field, electric                  potential, and Kirchhoff's rules. There is a heavy emphasis on                  teaching students how to construct rigorous, qualitative                        explanations of physical phenomena, including how to construct                  and use good diagrams as tools for both reasoning and                           explaining. Experimental work is central to the course, but                     does not require special laboratory sessions.  Students work                    collaboratively in the lecture hall on desktop experiments in                   electrostatics and DC circuits, and on the unified analysis of                  these experiments, including circuits, in terms of the basic                    Coulomb interaction and of the atomic structure of matter. The                  fundamental physical understanding that results from this                       qualitative work is the foundation for the more traditional and                 more quantitative material that forms the remainder of the                      course.  Instructional materials are being created and refined,                 and are being used evaluate in detail the effect of instruction                 on the reasoning and problem-solving processes of students.",
