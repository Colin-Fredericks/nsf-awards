Twenty                         middle school and twenty high school science teachers per                       year from northern and southern California will work with                       industry experts and museum staff to learn about latest                         innovations and developments, having access to industry                         research and development facilities through  summer workshop                    activities including behind-the-scenes tours and hands-on                       labs at the Museum that replicate industry applications                         useful in biology, computer science, chemistry, physics, and                    mathematics taught at participants' schools.                                                                                                                    \"Challenge activities\" based upon these real-world                              applications will be developed by each of forty, four-person                    teams beginning in the two-week summer workshop for the                         teacher-participant and then completed and implemented by a                     team formed by that teacher with three other teachers of                        science. They are supported by a mid-year teleconference of                     participants, project staff, and industry experts in                            addition to at least one half-day coaching visit and \"as-                       needed\" consultation by project staff and industry experts.                     Dissemination includes each of the 120 participants                             receiving the publication of all 120 challenge activities as                    well as presenting their projects in person at a spring fair                    open to all teachers and community members.                                                                                                                     Cost sharing by the museum, school districts, and industry                      accounts for 88.7% of the NSF budget contribution.",
