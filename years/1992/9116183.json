 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unlike traditional data networks, future broadband-ISDN (BISDN)              wide- area networks will be required to carry a broad range of                  traffic classes ranging from bursty, variable-rate sources, such as             voice and variable- rate coded video, to smooth, constant bit rate              sources.  Moreover, these networks will have to do so while                     providing a guaranteed performance or quality-of-service (QOS) to               these traffic classes.  The problem of characterizing performance in            such networks is thus particularly important since this must be done            not only for traditional off-line tasks of dimensioning and design              (e.g., determining link bandwidths, buffer capacities and processing            capacities at network switchpoints) but also for on-line,                       performance-driven traffic control purposes such as session- level              admission control.  In this proposal the principal investigators                outline research aimed at providing the analytical tools and                    techniques for analyzing such networks and their diverse workloads              and for designing and characterizing the properties of scheduling               policies in these networks. The principal investigators propose to:             1.develop techniques to upper bound a variety of per-session                    performance measures such as probability of buffer overflow and the             distribution of packet delay and to do so in a network environment              in which sessions may traverse several hops,    2.develop                       approximation techniques for estimating the probability of buffer               overflows in a network handling diverse classes of (potentially                 bursty) traffic sources, and    3.develop a sample path based on                methodology for characterizing optimal scheduling policies.",
