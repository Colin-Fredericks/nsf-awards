 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will recruit 105 middle school teachers from                       the Chicago area to participate in a month-long summer                          workshop that originates from Columbia College in Chicago,                      Illinois.  The project starts in November 1, 1992 and ends                      October 31, 1995.                                                                                                                                               This program extends previous work by Dr. Zafra Lerman from                     elementary schools into the middle schools, with the primary                    objective being to enhance middle school teachers' content                      and pedagogical knowledge in science.  The PI and others                        have developed, and are developing, curriculum that                             integrates science and mathematics.  The interdisciplinary                      approach to the curriculum extends beyond the linkage of                        math and science, since the physical, chemical and                              biological sciences will also be integrated.  Methods                           developed to excite science learning in teachers and                            students include the use of art, plays, music, dance, etc.                      These approaches also enable teachers to make connections                       across the curriculum for the students and illustrate the                       everyday context of science and mathematics.                                                                                                                    There is an approximate cost-share of 27%.",
