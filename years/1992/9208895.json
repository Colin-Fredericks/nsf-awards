 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                  of Professor Scott Gronert at San Francisco State University.                   Ab initio theoretical methods will be used to characterize the                  transition states of several fundamental organic reactions.                     Gaussian 90 will be used to examine the mechanisms and                          energetics of proton transfer, E2, and SN2 reactions.  Bader                    electron density analysis will be used to examine how the                       molecular electron density responds during chemical                             transformations and how it shifts to stabilize transition                       states.                                                                         %%%                                                                             Theoretical calculations will be undertaken in order to                         determine the changes in energy during an organic reaction and                  to determine the three dimensional structure of any                             intermediates formed on the way to product.  The calculations                   will be performed on small molecules in order to limit the                      number of assumptions that must be made.  These reactions,                      however, can serve as models for more complicated systems and                   the theoretical results will give new insights into the factors                 that affect these important reactions.  These calculations                      refer to the gas phase and will either confirm or question                      conclusions obtained from gas phase experimental studies.",
