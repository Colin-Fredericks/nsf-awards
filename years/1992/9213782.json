Fruits exposed to chilling injury have                  reduced storage length, as well as quality, due to adverse                      alterations in ripening process.  Acclimation to chilling                       injury leads to accumulation of new proteins that may be                        involved in ethylene biosynthesis, cell wall hydrolysis,                        turnover of pectic fragments, and/or accumulation of                            carbohydrates which serve as cryoprotectants.  The project will                 emphasize the early stages of acclimation process and                           mechanisms related to chilling tolerance which are not well                     characterized.",
