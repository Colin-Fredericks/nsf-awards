 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight undergraduates will be supported by this Research                    Experiences for Undergraduates renewal award.  It is an activity                which articulates closely with the institution's own                            project-based undergraduate research program.  The three faculty                advisors are well-versed in the philosophy of undergraduate                     research participation.  Excellent results achieved during the                  past four REU sites amply demonstrate their capabilities.                            Students will work in teams in one or more problem areas.                  Typical of these include studies of highly irregular graphs, edge               domination numbers of graphs, Hamming distances, pseudo-Boolean                 functions and excess problems related to birigid graphs.  Much of               the research involves a degree of computer experimentation which                will be integrated into the early stages of the program.                             All students will be required to communicate their completed               work as well as work in progress both orally and in writing.                    Finally, they will be encouraged to present their results at an                 appropriate academic meeting and to revise their reports for                    journal submission where significant progress has been made.",
