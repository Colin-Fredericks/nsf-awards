 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Department of Chemistry is purchasing a high field FT-NMR                  spectrometer with 13C and 1H resonance capabilities for use in                  the improvement of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  A                   particular effort is made to integrate the theory learned in                    formal courses with the undergraduate student research program.                 The basic principles and practice of 13C and 1H FT-NMR                          spectrometry are first introduced in the sophomore Organic                      Chemistry Laboratory courses where students personally use the                  new instrument to determine organic structures.  The junior-                    senior laboratory courses (Physical Chemistry, Analytical                       Biochemistry, and Instrumental Analysis) center on the                          technical aspects of fourier transform methods and the                          applications of 13C NMR alongside 1H NMR spectroscopic                          techniques for quantitative measurements of chemical systems.                   Specific NMR experiments include the determination of                           equilibrium constants, thermodynamic properties, pka values,                    and substituent constants; and studies on enzyme kinetics,                      stereospecific reactions, hydrogen exchange rates, and reaction                 mechanisms.  The use of the 13C/1H FT-NMR spectrometer also                     enhances the quality and quantity of student independent                        research which is an important component of the curriculum.",
