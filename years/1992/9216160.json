The board                       considers questions of the relation of engineering and technology               to costal and offshore resource development and operations; to                  navigation and the commerce of the sea, waterways, and ports; to                related human resources and onshore activities; and their                       relation to the establishment and implementation of public                      policies.  The Board identifies opportunities and needs for new                 technologies and other developments and recommends appropriate                  actions.  It stimulates the exchange of information and                         cooperative activities, and provides a forum for the national and               international professional community.                                                                                                                           The activities through which the Board accomplishes its program                 are: (1) assessments of the technical capability to undertake and               manage offshore and maritime developments and uses, including the               adequacy of knowledge to support technology development; (2)                    evaluations of safety of personnel and of the environment; (3)                  assistance in the preparation and assessment of the government's                program directed to ocean and maritime developments and uses; and               (4) identification of future opportunities for the integration of               advanced technology into marine or maritime systems and the                     influence of technical advances on the establishment and                        implementation of public policy.",
