 "awd_abstract_narration": "To have a broad impact on pollution prevention at the source                    in the chemical process industries (CPI), a multifaceted                        approach to the underlying fundamental problems is needed.                      Developing totally new processes involves huge new capital                      investments in order to affect a fraction of the pollutants                     produced by the CPI today.  With many trillions of dollars                      invested in existing chemical and oil refining plants in the                    U.S., it will be many years before research directed at                         totally new processes will have widespread impact on pollution                  reduction.  In order to have an important effect in reducing                    the production of pollutants in the next 10-20 years, focusses                  process revamps which require modest capital investments and                    maximize the impact of pollution reduction are desirable.                       These approaches, while complementing important research on                     totally new processes, can have greater impact in the next two                  decades because they require the least investment and produce                   the greatest benefits.  A requirement for success is                            identifying good candidates for process modeling, design, and                   operation in order to achieve the desired pollution reduction                   goals.  This research is directed towards developing new basic                  engineering tools for analyzing and designing processes so as                   to make modifications for pollution prevention, and then                        demonstrating the tools and the underlying principles on real                   problems form the CPI.                                                                                                                                          This research consists of fundamental studies of new basic                      engineering tools for precision process technology directed                     towards improvements in process design and process operation                    so as to eliminate pollution at its source.  The project will                   be broken into four components:                                                   (1) The application of detailed process models and the                              emerging results in dynamic stability theory in order to                        create parameter maps in process design and operation                           space which simultaneously satisfy product                                      specifications, production goals, and process dynamics                          which avoid process runaway episodes or large scale                             venting for safety reasons.                                                 (2) The development of fundamental control strategies for                           nonlinear processes subject to runaway because of                               process sensitivity and limited controller power (e.g.                          limited heat transfer capabilities).                                        (3) The development of general principles and strategies for                        product grade transitions for high volume processes in                          which off-spec product must be disposed of as waste.                        (4) The development of new polymerization processes which                           avoid the use of solvents in production and ultimate                            application.                                                              The research will be carried out in collaboration with some of                  the twelve industrial sponsors of the University of Wisconsin                   Polymerization Reaction Engineering Laboratory (UWPREL).",
