 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improving our ability to design and construct high quality                      facilities will require technological innovations.  Research plays              an important role in originating innovations.  However, there are               many barriers to implementing innovations.  A major new paradigm                is necessary in order to stimulate technological innovations within             the Construction Industry.  One proposed strategy is based on the               creation of an \"Institute\" dedicated to the promotion of \"                      Quality Constructed Facilities\".  The Institute would serve as the              catalyst for research directions, and the development and                       implementation of interdisciplinary approaches to design and                    construction.                                                                                                                                                   The goals of the workshop are as follows:                                                                                                                       1)   To establish whether there is a strong consensus for an                         \"Institute for Constructed Systems\".                                                                                                                       2)   To explore the role of the proposed institute within the                        National Science Foundation and the Civil Engineering                           Profession.                                                                                                                                                3)   To explore how the Institute could be implemented and funded.",
