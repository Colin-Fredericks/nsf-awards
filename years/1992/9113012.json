 "awd_abstract_narration": "A three year program of very low frequency (VLF) observations               at multiple sites across United States is proposed for the                      purpose of 'imaging' ionospheric disturbances that occur in                     association with lightning discharges.  The first year experiment               involves measurement of amplitude and phase of VLF transmitter                  signals at Puerto Rico, Huntsville, College Park, Houston and                   Stanford, providing a grid of great circle paths over the                       continent.  The location of transient ionospheric disturbancesare               determined by means of simultaneous occurrences on crossing and                 collinear VLF paths.  The lightning-induced ionospheric                         disturbance events are recognized on the basis of their                         characteristic signatures and occur due to (i) lightning-induced                precipitation of energetic particles from the radiation belts,                  and (ii) direct upward coupling of lightning radiation to the                   lower ionosphere producing intense heating and ionization.  The                 second year program involves measurements  at five closely spaced               sites in the vicinity of Huntsville, Alabama for the purpose of                 tomographic imaging on a tight (but irregular) grid of paths.                   The proposed measurement program synergistically benefits from                  Stanford observations at Palmer, Antarctica and a recently                      developed three dimensional model of VLF propagation in the                     earth-ionospherewaveguide.  The third year observation program                  emphasizes measurement of event occurence in the south western                  and south-cenbtral United States region of known high                           thunderstorm activity.",
