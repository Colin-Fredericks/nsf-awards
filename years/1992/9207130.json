 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Nutrient Enhanced Coastal Ocean Productivity program (NECOP) of             NOAA will use the R/V LONGHORN simultaneously and in collaboration              with the R/V PELICAN for 30 days in the general area of the mouth               of the Mississippi River (Southwest Pass) and the adjacent shelf                waters. Several transects of stations across the shelf will be                  occupied along the Louisiana shelf and intensive biological process             sampling will occur in the river plume and hypoxic areas ranging in             depth from 5 meters to 150 meters. Special sampling of river plume              fronts and other surface features will occur when encountered using             standard hydrocasts and/or underway surface mapping. A minor amount             of sampling time may be allocated to collection of samples in the               lower Mississippi River, Atchafalaya Bay, and the Mississippi shelf             canyon. The ship operation will consist of CTD/rosette hydrocasts,              net tows, and sediment boxcoring. Special deployments of in situ                zooplankton samplers and moored current meter and in situ                       instrumentation arrays will occur at a few selected sites near the              river mouth and nearby shelf.                                                                                                                                   Immediately following the NECOP cruise, R/V LONGHORN will load in               Cocodrie, Louisiana, to begin work on the Gulf.Cet program.                     Gulf.Cet is a study of the Distribution and Abundance of Marine                 Mammals in the North Central and Western Gulf of Mexico by Dr.                  William Evans. The work is being coordinated under contract to the              Minerals Management Service with funding through the Texas                      Institute of Oceanography, Texas A & M University. The study area               will be covered by 14 transect legs in the Gulf of Mexico offshore              from about the Louisiana/Alabama border to the Texas/Mexico border.             High powered binoculars will be used for the visual part of the                 survey and a specially modified hydro acoustic streamer will be                 used for acoustic detection. A cruise of fifteen days is schedule               for each quarter. The first quarter follows NECOP; the second                   quarter will be in late August or early September; and the third                quarter is tentatively scheduled for November (a final quarter will             fall in calendar 1993).                                                                                                                                         Two weeks in the first part of June will be devoted to work along               the Texas/Louisiana Coast for the NSF project, Stable Carbon and                Nitrogen Isotopic Compositions of Selected Organic COmpounds by                 Dr.s M.C. Kennicutt (Texas A & M University), S.A. Macko (U. of                 Virginia.), and R.R. Bidigare (U. of Hawaii.). IN addition to                   boxcoring and hydrowinch work, this project will also utilize R/V               LONGHORN as a mother ship, with work taking place off Zodiacs and               other small boasts.                                                                                                                                             Two or more student cruises, for The University of Texas at                     Austin's Department of Marine Science, to be scheduled during the               summer months, constitutes the remainder of the schedule.                       Traditionally the R/V LONGHORN has been able to respond on short                notice to last minute requests for shorter cruises within the Gulf              of Mexico during open periods of her schedule. We are prepared to               schedule some additional work if requested.",
