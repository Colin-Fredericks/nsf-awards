 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intercellular biochemical communication is a ubiquitous feature in              biology serving to mediate an enormous range of regulatory                      functions.  In vertebrate nervous systems, targets of innervation               secrete proteins known as neurotrophic factors, which are                       subsequently received by the innervating neuron.  Acquisition of                sufficient neurotrophic factor by individual innervating neurons                is essential for the proper development and maintenance of the                  nervous system.  Interruption of the flow of neurotrophic factor                from the target to the neurons result in the rapid neuronal                     destruction of the affected region.  In Dr. Feinstein's project,                he will examine the molecular mechanisms by which Nerve Growth                  Factor (NGF), the best understood among the neurotrophic factors,               mediates its action upon responsive neuronal cells.  NGF action is              known to be initiated by the interaction of NGF with \"slow\" (also               known as \"high affinity\") NGF receptors located in the neuronal                 plasma membrane.  He will first utilize a variety of immunological              strategies to generate novel molecular probes.  Then, he will use               these probes as tools to investigate the molecular composition of               the slow NGF receptors as well as the functions mediated by the                 slow NGF receptors.  These studies should markedly contribute to                our understanding of neurotrophic factor action and the development             and maintenance of the nervous system.*** //",
