Therefore,\r\nfor prevention of damage to adjacent structures and equipment nearby, in\r\nmany cases it is necessary to significantly reduce the transmission of such\r\nvibrations. For high frequency vibrations, this objective can be achieved by\r\nplacing a wave barrier between the source of vibration and the area to be\r\nprotected. In-filled concrete and soil-bentonite trenches have been used in\r\npractice for many years as wave barriers.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the completed research was to conduct an\r\nexperimental investigation on the influence of various geometrical and\r\nmaterial parameters on vibration screening effectiveness of in-filled trench\r\nbarriers and then utilize the experimental data to verify and calibrate the\r\nanalytical findings. To achieve this objective prototyped model tests were\r\nconducted in field in a remote area near the north campus of SUNY at\r\nBuffalo. Both near field (active) and far field (passive) vibration\r\nscreening by concrete and soil-bentonite in-filled trenches were studied. An\r\nelectromagnetic vibratory oscillator was used as a vibration source to set\r\nout continuous wave trains at selected frequencies. Measurements of ground\r\nvibration at selected pickup points were made 'with' and 'without' the\r\nin-filled barrier in place. The effectiveness of the barriers was computed\r\nas the ratio of the ground motion 'with' and 'without' the barrier. These\r\nresults were then compared with analytical solutions. Detail of this\r\ninvestigation has been presented in technical conferences, and will be\r\npublished in ASCE's Journal of Geotechnical Engineering.As a result of this\r\nresearch, the present level of knowledge among engineers and scientists on\r\nvibration screening by in-filled trenches will advance considerably.\r\n***\r\n",
