 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Elisabeth McFarlane and                                     Valerie Hillgren, two graduate students of                                      Professor Michael Drake, University of Arizona,                                 to travel to Germany to take advantage of an                                    unique combination of facilities and personnel                                  at the University of Bayreuth to carry out                                      experimental geochemistry research.  Professor                                  Drake made an extended visit to the Geological                                  Institute there in 1991.  Now he has arranged                                   for further related work to be carried out by                                   his students under the guidance of his principal                                collaborator at Bayreuth, Dr. David Rubie.  In                                  addition to fruitful interactions with Dr. Rubie                                and other experts at the Geological Institute,                                  the students will benefit from the availability                                 of two highly advanced and very rare pieces of                                  equipment: a multi-anvil press and an x-ray                                     microdiffractometer.  Both of these apparatus                                   are invaluable in conducting ultrahigh pressure                                 trace element partitioning experiments between                                  various metal and silicate phase pairs.  The                                    results of their experiments will be applied to                                 understanding the early thermal history and                                     differentiation of the Earth and Mars, and the                                  origin of the Moon.                                                                                                                                             The principal research program of Professor                                     Drake involves experimental studies of elemental                                partitioning among solid silicate, oxide, and                                   metal phases and silicate and metallic melts at                                 high pressures and temperatures.  Knowledge of                                  these partition coefficients is essential to the                                interpretation of elemental systematics in the                                  mantle and mantle-derived materials.  This bears                                specifically on the question of the formation                                   and early differentiation of the Earth and the                                  intimately associated problem of the origin of                                  the moon.",
