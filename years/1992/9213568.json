 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to develop a theoretical model                  capable of predicting the turbulent double-diffusive transport                  during the continuous alloy ingot casting process, and its                      implication on macrosegregation.  These issues, while critical to               meeting demands for enhanced performance of the US aerospace and                power industries, have not been properly addressed.  The motivation             of the work is that for the ingot casting processes of the                      production scales, their physical sizes and operating conditions                cause the convection field to be in the turbulent regime.                       Consequently, contrary to the information gathered from the small               scale laboratory studies that the mushy zone is generally thin                  everywhere, evidences indicate that turbulent convection makes the              instanteous mushy zone thickness and local solutal/thermal                      distributions vary considerably.  The classical way of deducing the             materials structure based on the casting speed and mean temperature             gradient is largely based on the conduction analysis alone, and                 hence may no longer be valid for the large scale production.  The               new model to be developed attempts to address the scaling issue and             will be validated by the experimental information specifically                  designed for the present collaboration.                                              The research will contribute to the production of defect free              metal ingots, which  will improve the productivity of the ingot                 casting process.",
