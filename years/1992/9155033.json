The program will consist of morning lectures in mathematics,                    statistics and the philosophy and ethics of science with afternoon              laboratory experiences in biology, chemistry and physics.                       Participants will be divided into three groups of twelve to rotate              through the afternoon laboratory sciences, and all 36 students will             spend the first 2 weeks of the camp attending the sessions on                   mathematics, statistics and philosophy.  During Week 3 the students             will cover career exploration and visits to various laboratories on             the campus of the Oklahoma State University.  Evening programs to               include astronomic observations as well as time to visit the                    library and to work on class assignments will be arranged.  In                  addition, a trip to the Omniplex -- a science museum and                        planetarium in Oklahoma City -- is planned for one of the Saturdays             during the project.",
