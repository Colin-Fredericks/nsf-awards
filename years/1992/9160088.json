 "awd_abstract_narration": "Management and search of large databases is a computational                     bottleneck in many domains.  One attractive approach to                         eliminating it is to exploit recent advances in parallel computer               hardware and processing.  However, the development of software                  that permits this represents one of the major challenges facing                 computer scientists.  This project proposes to develop a generic                approach to parallel database management that should be                         especially suitable for large databases of complex objects in                   which even single object comparisons may be computationally                     costly.  (Examples include databases of image data, in which                    database search may require numerous comparisons of complicated                 images.)  This approach is based on the use of Linda, a                         commercial product of Scientific Computing Associates, Inc.                     Linda systems provide convenient access to parallelism from                     within familiar high-level languages such as C or Fortran.  In                  Phase I, a fast text retrieval system will be developed for                     asynchronous multiprocessors.  This will serve as proof of                      concept for more general software to be investigated in Phase II                work.  Due to the use of Linda, the technology developed will be                not only efficient, but also portable across vastly different                   parallel architectures including both explicitly parallel                       computers and local-area networks of workstations functioning as                parallel \"hypercomputers\".",
