 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue support for another year in               the Department of Biology at Augustana College.  The program will               support undergraduate participation in a focused research program               which integrates the research activities of ten investigators from              Augustana College (6), Univ. Nebraska (1), The Nature Conservancy               (1), South Dakota State Univ. (1), and Black Hills State Univ. (1).             The projects are integrated at the scientific level because of the              common interests in prairie ecology and paleoecology, and because               aspects of each project benefit from the applications of the stable             isotopes of C and N to the research methodology.  A coherent group              and a unique methodology will be used to continue ecological and                archeological reconstructions in a geographic area of rich                      ecological resources and to encompass growing interest in diets and             physiology.                                                                                                                                                     Ten students (half women, half from off-campus) will study field                and laboratory problems with a common focus.  They will be expected             to gain some mastery of the theoretical basis for their study as                well as the experimental design and ultimate interpretation.                    Weekly seminars and workshops will review each project's                        theoretical basis and research design; enhance the students'                    library, laboratory, data handling, and scientific writing skills;              and broaden their understanding of the related projects.  The ten-              week summer program and academic year independent study will                    culminate in an REU Symposium in which each student will present                his/her interpreted results and conclusions and help develop the                hypotheses and research designs for next summer's projects.                     Outstanding women in the field will be selected as seminar speakers             and serve as role models for all students and faculty.  We will                 invite 20 high schools to select an outstanding woman student to                attend the REU Symposium and return for one day in the summer.",
