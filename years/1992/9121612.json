 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current research and practice in production planning and control                is dominated by hierarchical, material requirements planning-                   based methods.  Despite advances in computer technology, little                 real advance has occurred in the performance of U.S.                            manufacturing logistics management.  The objective of this                      project is to assess the merits of a major re-direction in the                  design of manufacturing planning systems which exploits computer                technology.  This project will test the relative performance of                 two fundamentally different classes of manufacturing planning                   systems: Those that make no use of sequencing and scheduling                    information in the order release planning process, and those                    which use such information to determine order releases.                                                                                                         A computer simulation model of a general multi-item, multi-state                manufacturing system will be used to conduct controlled                         experiments for evaluating the relative performance of the two                  approaches as measured by a number of different criteria over a                 wide range of operating environments.",
