 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tissue Engineering is a new discipline that has as its                          goal the reconstitution of tissues and organs for use as                        model systems in basic and applied research as well as for                      use as grafts to replace damaged of diseased body parts or                      body functions.  The tissues and organs built ex vivo may                       consist of living cells combined with extracellular                             molecules, or of acellular structures designed to be                            remodeled in vivo.  It is perceived that the products of                        Tissue Engineering must be standardized and                                     quality-controlled.  Regulatory issues related to their                         manufacture and use need to be formulated and resolved.                         Tissue Engineering is a nascent science and technology                          that draws support from many fields, including cell                             culture, extracellular matrix biochemistry, cell and                            developmental biology, immunology and biomechanics.                                                                                                             Shaping Tissue Engineering through the synthesis of the                         sub-disciplines on which it depends is one of the                               objectives of this Conference, which is organized around                        challenge topics that attempt to highlight the roles of                         the sub-disciplines.  Tissue Engineering has the potential                      of accelerating the application of discoveries made in                          basic research to useful products for both the laboratory                       and the clinic.  How this potential is realized is in                           large part the focus of this Conference.",
