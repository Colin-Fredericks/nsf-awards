 "awd_abstract_narration": "The studies proposed here focus on the physiology and biochemistry              of the polyacetylenes, fatty acid derivatives which are present                 mainly in the roots of Asteraceae.  Polyacetylenes show a wide                  range of biological activities (nematicidal, fungicidal and                     antiviral), and may play an important role in protecting plant                  roots against challenge from soil pathogens.  By transformation                 with Agrobacterium rhizogenes, we have obtained \"hairy roots\"                   cultures of five genera in the Asteraceae.  These fast growing                  roots have shown stable, long-term production of root                           polyacetylenes and are therefore an ideal experimental system.                  Using precursor label incorporation, HPLC and GC-MS analysis, and               cell-free assays, we propose to establish the pathway for                       polyacetylene biosynthesis in root cultures.  Fungal and nematodal              bioassays have been developed, and will be used to monitor the                  biological activity of the polyacetylenes produced in rootcultures.             The de novo formation of polyacetylenes in root cultures can be                 induced by treatment with fungal elicitors.  This approach will be              used to identiy the rate-limiting enzymatic steps in polyacetylene              biosynthesis, and test the proposed involvement of lipoxygenase.                Although roots normally grow heterotrophically both in isolated                 culture and \"in planta\", we have found that they can also be grown              photosynthetically and photoautotrophically.  We will also study                the quantitative and qualitative effects of photosynthesis and                  photoautotrophy on root polyacetylene patterns. ***//",
