 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project consists of three related components on               the impact of legal and political events on the West German steel               industry.  Part 1 studies the anticipated profitability changes due             to protectionist policies enacted after 1974 on behalf of the                   Western European steel industry.  The study focusses on German                  steel producers and is based on a stock market event study.  Part               2 is devoted to the study of electoral competition and its effects              on German federal steel policy after 1974.  The analysis is based               on a rational choice model which includes post-election                         institutional rivalry as a novel component.  Part 3 focusses on the             distorting effects of political precommitments to supply                        protectionist policy measures on the investment and output behavior             of steel producers.  Based on a theoretical model, the study                    analyzes the role of the Treaty of Paris (1951) as a determinant                for the long-term development of European Steel after 1974.                                                                                                     The results of this research are theoretically and methodologically             important in the areas of economics, political science, and law and             social science.  Also, its policy implications are provocative.                 The United States is surrounded by countries in which governments               take a much more active role in the regulation of economic change.              In Western Europe, industrial policy has become an essential                    instrument for securing a long-term growth and employment base.                 The EC authorities and national governments guided and regulated                the structural adjustment of the EC steel industry and, today                   unlike the U.S., European steel producers are again competitive on              the world market.  Also, as the nations in Western Europe move                  closer to a \"United Europe,\" it is more important than ever for the             U.S. to learn more about how the European market place is                       interconnected with political institutions on the various levels                of the political hierarchy to be able to take advantage of the                  newly developing economic opportunities.",
