 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decisions made during the design of a machined part can                    significantly affect the product's cost, quality, and lead time.                Thus, it is important to evaluate the machinability of the design,              providing feedback so that the designer can change the design to                improve its machinability.  For machining purposes, a part is often             considered to be a collection of machinable features.  However,                 often there can be several different interpretations of the same                part as different collections of machinable features.  Each                     interpretation corresponds to a different set of machining                      operations, in a different order, with different machinability.                      To determine the machinability of the part, all of these                   alternatives should be generated and their machinability evaluated.             This research will develop ways to do this automatically.  For                  generating the alternative feature interpretations, the                         investigator's will use an algebraic approach, in which new                     interpretations will be produced via algebraic operations on old                interpretations.  For evaluating the machinability of each feature,             the researchers will take into account the feature geometry,                    tolerance requirements, surface finish requirements, and                        statistical variations in the process capabilities.  The                        information provided by such an analysis can be used in several                 ways: (1) To provide information to the manufacturing engineer                  about alternative ways in which the part might be machined.  This               information can be useful in developing process planning                        alternatives depending on machine tool availability.  (2) To                    provide feedback to the designer identifying problems that may                  arise with the machining.  By comparing the best achievable                     tolerances with the designer's tolerance requirements,                          investigator's should be able to suggest small changes in the                   design that will significantly improve the machinability.",
