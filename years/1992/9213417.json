The workshop                    objective is to discuss the future needs and future directions of               U.S-Turkey collaborative research on the use of cementitious                    materials in concrete.  This workshop will follow the Fourth                    CANMET/ACI International Conference on Fly Ash, Silica Fume, Slag,              and Natural Pozzolans in Concrete to be held 03-08 May 1992 in                  Istanbul.  This proposal supports the travel of approximately eight             U.S. engineers who will participate in the workshop and also                    present papers at the conference.                                                                                                                               This workshop to plan future collaborative research activities                  involving construction materials fulfills the program objective of              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the               United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents and pool              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                       competence.",
