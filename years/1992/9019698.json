Paes Leme of the Polytechnic Institute of Rio de                                Janeiro, Brazil. The objective of the project is                                to mode., analyze and design numerical methods                                  for the simulation of multiphase flow in a                                      naturally fractured porous medium.  The                                         introduction of an appropriate system of                                        differential equations with proper boundary                                     conditions have recently improved various aspects                               of such flow.  For single and two-phase flow this                               will lead to a better description of the                                        interaction between fluids in fractures and in                                  porous rock.                                                                                                                                                    A further goal of this work is to extend this                                   approach to other flows where the effect of                                     compressibility, as well and the interchange of                                 mass between phases is considered.  Also, another                               objective is the study of macroscopic properties                                of the parameters of these models from                                          microstructural analysis.  This award will allow                                continuation of a productive U.S.-Brazil                                        collaboration.",
