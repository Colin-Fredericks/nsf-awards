By                                                         manipulating the aperture of an                                                 ultrasound transducer, a line type                                              echo spectra will be produced from                                              which the 3-D blood velocity                                                    vector, rather than merely the                                                  velocity components along and                                                   normal to the sound beam axis, will                                             be estimated.  Capillary blood flow                                             and perfusion also will be                                                      measured through the use of                                                     ultrasound contrast materials which                                                                                                                             can be injected into the blood.                                                 These contrast agents have a                                                    much stronger echo at the second                                                harmonic of the incident                                                        radiation than does tissue and                                                  therefore the ratio of the                                                      capillary blood echo to that of the                                             surrounding tissue will be                                                      enhanced.                                                                                                                                                       This research is important since it                                             could lead to advances in                                                       ultrasound technology, including                                                the improvement of the                                                          performance of current transducers                                              and the design of transducers with                                              certain operating features.  The                                                research also could enable flow                                                 measurements to be made in some                                                 locations where conventional                                                    systems are ineffective.  The                                                   contrast studies should enable more                                             effective visualization of the                                                  degree of perfusion.  These latter                                              studies also should enable the                                                  first measurement of capillary                                                  flow to be made using ultrasound.",
