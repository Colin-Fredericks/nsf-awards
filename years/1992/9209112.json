 "awd_abstract_narration": "Age dating of rocks from manson crater in central Iowa                     indicates that this crater was formed in the same time frame as the             K/T boundary, and the impacted strata are of the correct                        compositions to have generated the shocked minerals found in the                boundary clay layer worldwide, but most abundantly and of the                   largest grain sizes in the North American boundary clays.  Although             Ar40/Ar39 dating places the crater age at 65.7+1 m.y., a 4-sample               paleomagnetic study reported the crater rocks to have only normal               polarity magnetization.  Because the K/T boundary is found                      worldwide in a reversed polarity interval, the normal polarity                  results have led to the inference by some that the Manson impact                did not happen at the K/T boundary.  However, the study was                     exceedingly small, and moreover, the samples displayed some                     ambiguous magnetization behavior.  This study involves a two-fold               paleomagnetic study of the rocks in Manson Crater to determine the              polarity and age of magnetization.  First is a detailed study of                the magnetization of the impact breccia.  Both the matrix magneti-              zation and a \"conglomerate test\" of the clast magnetizations                    potentially can reveal the polarity of the geomagnetic field at the             time of the Manson impact, hence whether or not the crater was                  formed in the same polarity as the K/T boundary.  Further the                   magnetostratigraphy of the post-impact, as well as the pre-impact               sedimentary sequences will be studied to further narrow the age                 range of the impact event.   The magnetostratigraphy study also has             the potential to narrow the uncertainty of the radiometrically                  determined age of Manson crater from 2 m.y. to less than 0.5 m.y.               It is important to determine whether the Manson impact is an                    indication that the K/T boundary phenomena are the result of                    multiple impacts.",
