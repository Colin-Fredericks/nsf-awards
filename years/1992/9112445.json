 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this grant, Dr. Shrader-Frechette is examining three                      methodological issues that are central to community ecology or                  population biology.  (1)  Are explanations in community ecology                 particular, as many biologists have claimed?  (2) Are there                     empirical laws or laws of nature in community ecology?  (3)  Are                there individually testable hypotheses, including null hypotheses,              in community ecology?  After evaluating these three methodological              questions in terms of the arguments and examples that ecologists                on various sides of the issues have employed, Dr. Shrader-Frechette             will attempt to draw two sets of conclusions.  One set concerns the             nature of scientific explanation in ecology.  The other set of                  conclusions concerns what, if anything, the status of law and                   explanation in community ecology might reveal about scientific law              and explanation in general.  This project promises to contribute                to the on-going debates about whether the alleged explanations and              laws of ecology are like those of the physical sciences; what is                the empirical status of alleged ecological laws; what is the scope              of realistic hopes for improving he \"scientific\" status of ecology;             whether, and if so, in what sense, ecology is a science; and what               the nature of explanation and law in ecology reveals about                      scientific law and explanation in general.",
