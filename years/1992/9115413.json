 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted on microscopically realistic models of               interfacial patterns in non-eqilibrium condensed matter systems.                These models should be sufficiently accurate so as to allow for                 quantitative tests of current theoretical concepts.  These concepts             include the \"solvability\" theory for ordered structures,                        bifurcation theoretic analysis of secondary instabilities in                    cellular patterns, mean field methods for \"ensemble-averaged\"                   Diffusion Limited Aggregation and ideas regarding the emergence of              braod-band spectra in non-linear systems via self-organized                     criticality.\"  These ideas must be combined with specific and                   detailed models if they are to yield quantitative predictions                   regarding pattern forming behavior.  In the course of this work,                studies will be made of the solidification of monolayers, where the             reduced dimensionality enables one to perform exact shape                       calculations and compare to general schemes for bifurcation of                  cellular states;  a new mathematical model will be developed for                the recent stream instability experiment which exhibits a                       transition to broad-band dynamics;  solvability theory for free                 dendritic growth will be extended to the realistic case of non-                 axisymmetric crystals with cubic surface tension anisotropy so as               to be able to directly compare with experiment; and, mean field                 Diffusion Limited Aggregation calculations will be done on a                    variety of geometries and dimensions so as to ascertain the                     generality and usefulness of this new approach.                                 %%%                                                                             A variety of problems in the exciting new field of nonlinear                    science which impact condensed matter physics and materials                     research will be studied.  The problems focus on models of the                  nonlinear dynamics of interfacial patterns which are realistic and              can, thus, be compared with experimental results.",
