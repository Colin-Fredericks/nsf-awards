 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Narrative:  This is a travel award to finalize a                      research proposal in the area of high resolution laser                          spectroscopy which will be submitted to the NSF.  Dr. Rao of                    Adelphi University will finalize a collaborative research                       proposal with Dr. Srivastava of the Indian Institute of                         Technology, Kanpur.  The proposed research is high resolution                   doppler free laser spectroscopy.  This enables the study of ultra               narrow atomic/molecular lineshapes, linewidths and small energy                 shifts.  Many new physical phenomena which are not normally                     accessible can be measured now.  High precision and extreme                     sensitivity offered by the high resolution Doppler free laser                   spectroscopy techniques will be employed to study  1) the                       hyperfine structure of the atomic levels including Rydberg states               and the excitation and autoionization of atoms and molecules in                 electron-ion collisions 2) atomic hyperfine structure and the                   nonlinear polarization of the atoms using Degenerate Four Wave                  Mixing 3) of collision cross sections, rate coefficients,                       collisional electronic excitation transfer and other atomic and                 molecular parameters.                                                                                                                                           Scope:  This proposal is to support Dr. Rao's travel to Kanpur,                 India where he has been invited by the Department of Physics,                   Head to develop a collaborative program to utilize the                          sophisticated facilities at their high resolution laser                         spectroscopy laboratory.  This is the only laboratory of its kind               in India and has been identified by the Department of Science and               Technology as a high interest area.  Dr. Rao in collaboration                   with several scientists at Kanpur expects to provide the                        necessary expertise to initiate the project.",
