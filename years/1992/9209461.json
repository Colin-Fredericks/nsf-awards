In inducing such a code children must use                   information available in the speech that they hear and the events               that they witness in combination with preprogrammed constraints                 on syntactic hypotheses.  The process of induction has come to be               called \"bootstrapping\" in the acquisition literature.                                                                                                           Previously, the speech streem has been largely overlooked as a                  potential source of information about linguistic structure.                     Recently, however, an increasing number of scholars in a range of               disciplines have begun to investigate the relationship between                  input speech and the acquisition of syntax.  These researchers                  include theoretical and computational linguists, acousticians,                  speech pathologists, and psychologists and cognitive scientists                 specializing in speech perception and language acquisition.                                                                                                     Unfortunately, most of these researchers work in relative                       isolation, having little opportunity for contact with those from                other disciplines.  It is time to bring them together, that they                might share insights and chart directions for future research in                this vitally important new area of research.  PIs Morgan and                    Demuth are therefore organizing a working conference on                         bootstrapping from speech to syntax.  The proceedings of the                    conference will be published.",
