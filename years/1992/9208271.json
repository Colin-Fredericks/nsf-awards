 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this US-Poland research project between                        Dr. A. W. Castleman of the Pennsylvania State University                        and Dr. H. Wincel of the Institute of Physical Chemistry,                       Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw is to investigate                            mechanisms of heterogenous chemical reactions of                                environmental importance and to underdtand the coupling                         between cycles involving both natural atmospheric                               constituents and pollutants introduced through various                          industrial processes.  The researchers will investigate:                        (1) cluster distributions, and studies to unravel the                           dynamics of formation and the growth of clusters; (2) the                       stability and reaction energetics of cluster ions through                       measurements of their thermochemical properties; (3) the                        reactivity of clusters of varying size to elucidate the                         reaction mechanisms as influenced by various chemical                           constituents and degrees of aggregation/solvation; and (4)                      photostability and photodissociation, which complement                          studies on the thermodynamic stability of ion clusters and                      elicit some spectroscopic information as well as                                information on the influence of light on pollutant                              conversion reactions.  During the course of the work, the                       researchers will intend to probe directly the spectroscopy                      of clusters via multiphoton ionization, so that the                             effects of clustering on electronic states can be                               determined.  The results will provide further insight into                      the nature and strength of cluster bonds, energy transfer                       following photoabsorption, and hence reactivity.                                                                                                                This project in atmospheric science fulfills the program                        obvjective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                      combine complementary talents andn pool resources in areas                      of strong mutual interest and competence.",
