 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computer laboratory classroom is being used full-time and                     exclusively for undergraduate mathematics instruction.  Through                 the laboratory, instruction will be enhanced, providing                         significantly improved versions of calculus courses that are                    taken primarily by undergraduate majors in mathematics,                         engineering, and the physical sciences. The computer equipment                  will be used to significantly enhance student conceptual                        understanding of the fundamental mathematical ideas.  By                        incorporating computer graphics and symbolic algebra software                   into the lectures, students can focus on the main ideas instead                 of the routine algebraic manipulations that most students                       associate with mathematical activity.  In addition,                             experimental versions of undergraduate courses in multivariable                 calculus, ordinary differential equations, and linear algebra                   will be developed.  During each of the fall and spring                          semesters, about twelve sections of first-year calculus courses                 (totaling 480 students per semester) will meet in the                           laboratory at least weekly, and four sections of the more                       advanced courses (totaling 160 students per semester) will be                   taught exclusively in this laboratory.In the summer, the                        laboratory will provide a greatly expanded, full-time facility                  for the Arizona State University Minority Youth Program, the                    goal of which is to increase the supply of students from                        traditionally under represented ethnic groups majoring in                       mathematics and science.  During each summer 200 high school                    student participants will be taught in this facility.",
