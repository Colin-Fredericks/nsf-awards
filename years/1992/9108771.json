The research clusters include: (1)                          Multidisciplinary Approach to Molecular Analysis of Plant                       Biotic Stress; (2) Surface Hydrology; (3) Rock-Fluid                            Interactions in Crustal Rocks; (4) Advanced Materials for                       Photonics, Lasers, and Electro-optics (AMPLE); and (5)                          Laboratory for Electronic Properties of Materials.  The                         participating research universities, Oklahoma State                             University, University of Oklahoma, and University of Tulsa,                    will strengthen their research infrastructure during the                        present EPSCoR grant through (1) an increase in faculty, (2)                    establishment of an endowed chair program, (3) an investment                    in research of over $65 million during 1985-90 through                          Oklahoma Center for Advancement of Science and Technology,                      (4) assistance in the relocation of technology-sensitive                        industry to Oklahoma, (5) establishment of three Centers of                     Excellence and (6) special programs to increase research                        competitiveness of faculty.  The State and institutions will                    contribute over $2.6 million in support of the EPSCoR                           effort.",
