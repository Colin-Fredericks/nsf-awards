 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has as its goal the                   development of machines that can perceive, reason, communicate, and             act in complex environments much like humans can, or possibly even              better than humans can.  Even though the field has produced some                practically useful machines with rudiments of these abilities, it               is generally conceded that the ultimate goal is still distant.                  That being so, there is much discussion and argument about what are             the best approaches for AI in the sense of laying the core                      foundations for achieving ultimate goals as well as best in the                 sense of producing practically useful shorter-term results.  Thus,              a number of different paradigms have emerged over the past                      thirty-five years or so.  Each has its ardent advocates, and some               have produced sufficiently many interesting results so as not to be             dismissable out of hand.  Perhaps combinations of these approaches              will be required.  In any case, the advocates of these approaches               often feel that theirs is the \"breakthrough\" methodology that                   deserves special support. In order to acquaint researchers and                  others with these paradigms and their principal results, the Santa              Fe Institute organizes a workshop to which advocates actively                   working in the different approaches will be invited.  Such a                    workshop allows leading workers to understand each others' points               of view and the relationships among them.  Specifically the                     workshop is not organized around what classically have been the                 main sub-disciplines of AI, namely machine vision, natural language             processing, knowledge representation, planning, expert systems, and             so on.  Instead, different perspectives are presented on how the                whole, or major parts, of AI ought to be attacked.",
