 "awd_abstract_narration": "Barrington's nucleus is a collection of cells in the brainstem that             projects to spinal cord neurons innervating the bladder.  Based on              lesion and stimulation studies, this nucleus has long been thought              to be involved in the micturition reflex.  Recently, Dr. Valentino              noted that this nucleus contains one of the most dense clusters of              corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-immunoreactive neurons in the              brain.  Since CRF is the primary brain hormone that initiates the               stress response and that stress increases the synthesis of CRF in               these neurons, she has proposed that Barrington's nucleus is                    involved in the regulation of autonomic function under stressful                conditions.  Dr. Valentino will systematically study this major                 CRF-containing brain nucleus and its possible role in stress.  She              will employ state-of-the-art anatomical methods to map the afferent             and efferent connections of CRF-containing neurons of Barrington's              nucleus in the brain.  These studies will identify the neural                   circuitry by which stressors are able to communicate activity to                this nucleus.  In addition, Dr. Valentino along with her                        collaborator, Dr. Aston-Jones, will use electrophysiologic criteria             to determine how different kinds of stressors alter activity of                 these CRF-containing neurons in this region.  The results will not              only provide new information about the function of Barrington's                 nucleus but may lead to a better understanding about how the brain              integrates the multicomponent response to a stressor.",
