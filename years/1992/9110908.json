 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much research focuses on the development of specialized architectures.          To increase the utility of task-oriented or specialized parallel                networks, one can simulate one parallel network on another.  Of                 primary interest are lower bounds on the cost of such simulation.               This project investigates the actual performance of proposed                    theoretical embeddings strategies by simulating them on a hypercube             machine.                                                                                                                                                        The contribution of this practical investigation will be to establish           how quickly the increase in embedding costs prohibit an actual                  simulation.  By simulating different architectures on the hypercube,            one may compare how similar measures of embedding costs, and their              growth, are affected by architectural design.  For example, an edge             congestion cost greater than one may be more deleterious for an                 asymmetric network.  Furthermore, the effects of even a slight                  increase in such a cost may have more dramatic effects in asymmetric            architectures.  However, such differences may be minimized if the cost          can be localized or redistributed.  Pure embeddings do not consider             these possible revisions but a simulation may suggest an efficient              means for obtaining improvements.",
