The                    program provides undergraduates contemplating a career in the                   biological sciences with:  1) an introduction to current research               in the areas of soil ecology, plant and insect ecology and                      evolution, plant physiology and behavioral ecology; 2) the                      opportunity to conduct original research in a supportive,                       interactive environment; 3) instruction in the planning, execution,             and interpretation of research in the areas of ecology, evolution               and behavior.  All participating students will attend a course that             will introduce them to the fields of ecology, evolution and                     behavior, aid in planning and executing an original research                    project, give them an introduction to statistical analysis, and                 provide information on applying to graduate school.  They will also             present the results of their research in a short seminar at the end             of the summer.  Students will work with faculty members on their                projects, and will also be able to interact with other students and             post-docs in their laboratories.",
