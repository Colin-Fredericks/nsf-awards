 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical need exists to develop the technology that will allow                processing polymers at faster speeds and that will result in                    polymeric materials with higher degrees of molecular orientation.               Such advances will make existing processes more competitive and                 will increase the prospects for manufacturing valuable new                      products.  It is likely that these goals can be reached if                      experimental techniques for studying polymers at high strain rates              are improved and the resulting information is used to develop a                 microscopic understanding of how polymer liquids flow.  This                    project is intended to provide this fundamental knowledge.  It                  describes experimental research work on the molecular and fluid                 mechanics of polymeric liquids subjected to flow types that contain             a mixture of shear and extension typically found in commercial                  processing operations.  The experiments will investigate, using a               range of techniques, the most important parameters affecting the                rheological response:  entanglement density and molecular-weight                distribution.  A data base of this type on materials that have                  well-characterized molecular structures is the necessary starting               point.  The molecular understanding so obtained will be used to                 continue the development of models described in the project.  The               ultimate goal is to have a detailed understanding of the highly                 nonlinear response that exits under these conditions and to use                 this information to devise new processing procedures that will                  optimize the macroscopic properties of polymers.                                                                                                                This research is jointly supported by the Polymers Program in the               Division of Materials Research and the Fluid, Particulate and                   Hydraulic Systems Program of the Division of Chemical and Thermal               Systems.",
