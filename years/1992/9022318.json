 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project constitutes a portion of U.S. joint global ocean                   flux study (JGOFS) of the  central equatorial Pacific.  Several                 observations have been made in this region which contradict some                of our conventional concepts of trophic status and the                          relationship between plankton community structure and vertical                  flux.  High nitrogen concentrations and supply rates, usually                   associated with eutrophic conditions, co-exist with relatively                  low chlorophyll, primary productivity, and \"new production\" -                   which are characteristics of oligotrophic waters.  Smaller pico-                and nanoplankton cells dominate the phytoplankton (Chavez, et.al.               in press), yet significant rates of biogenic sedimentation occur                and is correlated with primary production. High flux rates are                  usually thought to be associated with large cells, such as                      diatoms, sinking out of surface waters or being consumed by                     larger cells, fecal pellet-producing metazooplankton.  These                    apparent contradictions indicate that the consequences of                       phytoplankton size structure, protozoan versus metazoan grazing,                and their relationship to vertical flux of material out of the                  surface layer are not fully understood.                                                                                                                         This project will examine these contradictions by measuring the                 abundances and biomass of the phototropic picoplankton,                         phototrophic and heterotrophic nanoplankton, and phagotrophic                   protozoans in the surface water, and the grazing impact and                     growth rates of protozooplankton.  We study will employ proven,                 state-of-the-art color image analysis combined with                             epifluorescence microscopy to describe the size, trophic and                    taxonomic structure of the plankton.  Results will be used to                   determine the role of protozoan zooplankton in the coupling of                  production, consumption and export of particulate of particulate                organic matter in the surface waters of the central equatorial                  Pacific.",
