 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze the distortions arising               from the corporate income tax.  In the past attention has been                  focused on the impact of the corporate income tax on the rate of                corporate investment, corporate debt policy, and dividend policy.               In contrast, this research focuses on the effects of the tax on                 the organization structure of the firm, the type and composition                of labor compensation, and the location of borrowing by                         multinational firms.  This research is important because it will                provide a better understanding concerning the extent to which                   this tax might effect the performance of the U.S. economy.                                                                                                      The project consists of four empirical studies to measure                       distortions arising from the differential taxation of corporate                 and noncorporate income.  The first study will use a panel data                 set of individual tax returns to examine tax effects on                         individual investment in corporate and noncorporate firms.  The                 second study will use a panel data set of unemployment insurance                records to measure the effects of taxes on the composition of                   firm entrants and exits, the relative growth rates of corporate                 and noncorporate firms, and the frequency of reorganizations of                 existing firms.  The third study will analyze the extent to which               corporate entrepreneurs have an incentive to identify their labor               income as corporate income in order to avoid personal taxation.                 IRS tax return data will be used for this analysis.  The fourth                 study will analyze an aspect of the 1984 Tax Reform Act which                   gave multinational firms an incentive to shift their borrowing                  into foreign subsidiaries.",
