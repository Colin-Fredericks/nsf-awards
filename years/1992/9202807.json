 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to investigate the design of                        parallel algorithms for geometric problems, both for shared-                    memory (PRAM) models and the (more realistic) network models.                   The network models of interest include the situation where the                  number of processors available p is fixed (i.e., does not                       depend on the size n of the problem being solved).  In such a                   framework, one needs to bring into the picture the sequential                   \"front end\" to the parallel machine, since the parallel                         machine is too small to even store the problem being solved.                    Thus the techniques used are both parallel and sequential,                      since a substantial part of the computation may take place in                   the sequential machine.  Attention will be given to  problems                   that are still open within the traditional frameworks (i.e.,                    assuming massive rather than limited parallelism), with                         special emphasis on problems whose solution would impact the                    parallel complexity of many geometric problems (for example,                    multisearching and matrix searching).  The project will also                    initiate investigation of parallelism for computational                         algebraic geometry and geometric modeling.  The research                        undertaken involves implementations on commercially available                   parallel hardware.",
