 "awd_abstract_narration": "The contraction of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles requires               cyclic interactions between the two main muscle proteins, myosin                and actin.  The essential steps in these interactions include the               activation of the myosin ATPase activity by actin and, according to             prevalent views, conformational changes on one or both of these                 proteins.  A major goal of the proposed research is to clarify the              molecular basis of these events.  To achieve aim, actin sites                   necessary for the activation of the myosin ATPase activity and the              motility of actin filaments will be mapped.  The experimental                   materials to be used in the mapping of functional sites on actin                will include peptide antibodies, actin mutants, and modified                    actins.  These materials will be used in the in vitro motility                  assays, and in biochemical and  biophysical assays of actomyosin                interactions.  In another part of this program, the structural                  determinants of the essential steps in actomyosin interactions will             be clarified by comparing the properties of monomeric and polymeric             complexes of actin and myosin.  Peptides, protein fragments, cross-             linked protein complexes, peptide antibodies, and actin mutants                 will be used in this project.  The role of specific sites on actin              in actomyosin interactions will be assessed via chemical                        modifications, proteolytic digestions, fluorescence and light                   scattering measurements, and other measurements carried out on                  these materials.  Additional insight into actomyosin interactions               will be obtained by clarifying the mechanism of G-actin                         polymerization by myosin.                                                       %%%                                                                             The proposed studies should lead to the elucidation of the basic                mechanism of actomyosin interactions and thus, a better                         understanding of how the muscle functions and how chemical energy               is transduced into work in biological systems.",
