 "awd_abstract_narration": "Medical malpractice represents the intersection of patient concerns             about the quality of medical care with the use of law to redress                a perceived grievance.  When patients are dissatisfied with the                 quality of the medical care they receive, they can either register              a complaint at a hospital or file a lawsuit.  If they register a                complaint, the hospital's complaints office may respond by offering             a forum for an individual to air a grievance, providing                         compensation in the form of forgiveness of a patient's outstanding              bill, or by offering cash compensation.  If an offer of                         compensation is made, the patient has a choice between accepting                the offer or rejecting it, in which case (s)he may file a medical               malpractice lawsuit.  If no offer of compensation is made, the                  patient has a choice between filing a lawsuit or taking no further              action.  To date, very little research has been completed which                 seeks to examine how complaints evolve into settlements, and into               medical malpractice lawsuits.                                                                                                                                   Dr. White will fill this gap in medical malpractice research by                 collecting a rich set of data on complaints registered in a                     specific hospital and merging it with an existing data set                      concerning medical malpractice lawsuits from the same source.                   Utilizing the merged data set, models will be constructed to                    analyze what determines whether complaints evolve into lawsuits,                assess which side benefits most from resolving disputes early, and              estimate whether negligence matters in determining the hospital's               expected liability at the complaint stage of the dispute management             process.  This phase of the project should provide considerable                 insight into the pre-litigation dispute resolution process in                   general and how the early stages of dispute processing influence                the evolution of complaints into settlements or into lawsuits.                  Using a simulation approach, the second phase of the project                    investigates the costs and benefits of shifting from the current                system of liability in medical malpractice to a hypothetical no-                fault system.  This phase of the project will investigate a series              of important policy questions, including an estimate of the effect              of a shift to no-fault on the level of total compensation paid and              the cost of administering the compensation system.",
