 "awd_abstract_narration": "When two or more simply behaving relaxation oscillators are                coupled, new and complex qualitative behavior arises in many                    cases. This research aims at understanding these effects by                     exploring the geometry of the phase flow using previously                       developed analytic insights and estimates.  In another direction,               the investigator extends the theory of adiabatic invariance to                  slowly varying ergodic systems by using combinatorial and                       geometric ideas.                                                                     When two simple oscillators such as an electric circuit or a               biological cell, each behaving in a simple periodic fashion, are                coupled, the resulting system can acquire totally new features                  such as chaotic behavior, bifurcations, etc., of which there                    seems to have been no hint in the individual components.  The aim               of this research is to describe and to explain phenomena of this                sort in differential equations that model coupled biological,                   electric, or mechanical systems.  In a different direction, the                 phenomenon of adiabatic invariance is of fundamental importance                 in the theory of dynamical systems; it arises when a system                     undergoes a slow change over a long period of time.  Somewhat                   unexpectedly, a system may develop a \"memory\": some quantities,                 called the adiabatic invariants, change little over the course of               the system's evolution.  (The simplest example is a pendulum on a               string whose length is, say, halved slowly; in this case the                    ratio of the energy to the frequency changes very little; this                  ratio is an adiabatic invariant).  Adiabatic invariants arise in                the study of elecromagnetically confined plasmas, in particle                   accelerators, in planetary motion and in many other cases.                      Although the subject is about 80 years old, there is no                         satisfactory analysis of this phenomenon for an important class                 of chaotic systems.  This is a serious gap in the subject                       considering the fact that adiabatic invariance is a basic aspect                of Hamiltonian dynamical systems.  It is proposed to develop a                  rigorous theory of the phenomenon of adiabatic invariance for                   chaotic systems.  Such a theory would be of fundamental                         significance for applications of dynamical systems                              as well. As an example, it would be a small but important                       building block in the long-open problem of providing a rigorous                 foundation for the theory of ideal gases -- modeling a gas by a                 system of many colliding hard spheres in a vessel of changing                   size and shape.",
