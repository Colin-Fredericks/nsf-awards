Hasan of                                   the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore                                 will study intense flux tubes on the sun.  This                                 investigation of small-scale solar magnetic                                     fields is directed towards a fundamental,                                       unsolved problem in solar physics, the                                          heating of the quiet chromosphere which takes                                   place mainly in magnetic flux tubes.  This                                      investigation seeks to examine the                                              stability, dynamics, energy transport and                                       oscillations in collapsing flux tubes by means                                  of 1.5-D time-dependent, dynamical                                              calculations.  The use of two-dimensional                                       radiative transfer, will be a significant                                       improvement over previous analyses.  The                                        results of this study will help in                                              understanding the physics of flux tubes, the                                    structure of the bright chromosphere, and                                       long-period oscillations of the atmosphere in                                   flux tubes.                                                                                                                                                     Scope:  This project joins efforts in radiative                                 transfer by  W. Kalkofen and colleagues at the                                  Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and                                 in magnetic fields by S.S. Hasan and colleagues                                 at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics in                                      Bangalore.  It will begin collaboration between                                 the Harvard group working on problems                                           in radiative transfer, static magnetic fields                                   and chromospheric heating and the Bangalore                                     group investigating time-dependent magnetic                                     fields, solar magnetic fields and chromospheric                                 lines.  Drs. Kalkofen and Hasan are highly                                      competent researchers and the Indian Institute                                  of Astrophysics has an excellent tradition of                                   research on the Sun.",
