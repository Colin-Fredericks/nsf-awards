 "awd_abstract_narration": "By detailed field work and modeling, the late Quaternary                   sediment record in Illinois will be investigated to determine the               origin of subglacial tills that were deposited in the marginal area             of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.  Massive, homogenous diamictons that               classically have been interpreted to be lodgement till may instead              have originated primarily through subglacial deformation in a                   deforming bed.  Reconstructions of the Lake Michigan Lobe profile               in Illinois and preliminary field study of glacigenic sediment are              consistent with evidence of a deforming bed that has been suggested             on theoretical grounds.                                                              Methods will consist of two summers of detailed                            sedimentological and structural study of carefully selected sites,              focusing on differentiating subglacial till that is relatively                  undeformed from till that has experienced internal deformation by               pervasive subglacial shearing to large strains.  Further analysis               will consist of:  (1) geotechincal analyses in order to evaluate                rheological parameters of the till; (2) determining sediment                    transport fluxes during the maximum of the last glaciation and                  comparing those data will data derived from different models of                 glacial transport; and (3) numerical modeling of the Lake Michigan              Lobe ice-till system.  The results of this research will have                   significant implications for interpreting the origin of massive,                homogenous till units in mid-latitude regions, as well as for                   understanding and modeling the dynamics of the Laurentide Ice                   Sheet.",
