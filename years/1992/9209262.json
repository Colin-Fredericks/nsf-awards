The primary                   objective of this research is to utilize the archival records of                the Aland Islands, Finland, for such two such analyses.  First,                 excellent archival records are available for the past 250 years,                facilitating long-term demographic studies as well as the                       construction of multigenerational pedigrees.  Second, this                      population has high frequencies of several genetic diseases that                are very rare in other populations.  The investigators are                      interested in determining the evolutionary forces responsible for               these disease frequencies.                                                                                                                                      The initial goal of this project is to complete the computer                    entry of archival records from Aland so that they can be used in a              computerized construction of pedigrees for the entire population.               This will allow the analysis of inbreeding levels, nonrandom                    mating, the degree of genetic isolation, and the extent to which                individual ancestral founders may have made disproportionate                    genetic contributions to the current generation. These studies will             have evolutionary significance, and they will help to explain why               the Aland Islands population has a high incidence of some genetic               diseases.",
