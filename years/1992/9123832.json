 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in spatial analysis and related                            methodologies such as geographical information systems have                     pointed up the need for a better understanding of the statistical               properties of spatial correlation and autocorrelation.  Failure                 to take spatial autocorrelation into account can lead to serious                errors in model interpretation.  Spatial modeling must not only                 take account of dependence structure and heteroscedasticity, but                it must also assess the effects of spatial scale.  This research                focuses on a new family of spatial association statistics, G, by                experimentation on spatially distributed variables in different                 situations, especially with small samples.  The ultimate                        objective is to incorporate the G statistics into geographical                  information systems in order to explore the influence of spatial                dependence and spatial heterogeneity on a variety of analytical                 models.                                                                              Geographers, geologists and econometricians, among others,                 have used a variety of statistical techniques for measuring                     spatial association.  This research project will add a more                     powerful tool for the analysis of spatial distributions, because                of its direct application at a variety of spatial scales.                       Integration of the G statistics into geographical information                   systems will permit more rigorous analysis of spatial                           distributions at different levels of spatial aggregation, thus                  extending their utility to many different problems.",
