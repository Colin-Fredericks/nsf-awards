 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to determine the effect of               the structure of a fiber preform on its conformability to certain               part shapes -- e.g., corners, curves.  The use of fiber preforms                can significantly open up the medium to high volume composite                   markets due to its potential to produce cost-effective yet                      structurally sound, near net shape parts.  However, complex part                shapes can result in regions where the alignment of fibers  is not              in the direction of maximum loading.  In addition, fiber movement               can result in regions of low fiber volume fraction leading to weak              spots.  Both of these variations tend to occur in areas where                   stress concentrations are also a concern, resulting in failures                 below projected loading capacity.  The project will investigate                 several methods of measuring preform deformation (e.g., tensile,                shear, and bending behavior) -- including the use of optical and                image analysis techniques, tracer fibers, and various load                      configurations simulating processing conditions.  It is expected                that this preliminary work will lead to a more detailed study                   resulting in the quantification of the deformation response of                  aligned, biaxial, and random fiber mats.  By understanding the                  deformation behavior of different fiber mat geometries, the                     response of various preform architectures to processing conditions              can be predicted and thus optimized to fit the desired part shape.                   A detailed understanding of the behavior of fiber mats is                  essential to the widespread use of composite materials in the \"mass             market\" application areas, particularly in the automotive industry.",
