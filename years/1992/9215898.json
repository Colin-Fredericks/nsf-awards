There                                  are some 500 to 1,000 scientists in the former                                  Soviet Union working in this area.  The Second                                  Seminar, to be held June 22-26, 1992 in St.                                     Petersburg, Russia, will be devoted to the                                      physics of ferroelectrics and related materials                                 and will focus on the optics and spectroscopy of                                ferroelectrics.  Emphasis will also be given to                                 the structure and properties of new classes of                                  ferroelectrics, including connections with high                                 temperature superconducting oxides.
