 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this study will be Escherichia coli RNA polymerase                 (RPase).  The interaction of RPase with a wide variety of synthetic             templates, native promoters and variant promoters have been                     extensively studied.  However, there are aspects of the                         thermodynamics and kinetics of the interaction of RPase with                    promoters have been extensively studied.  However, there are                    aspects of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the interaction of                RPase with promoter sites that have yet to be delineated.  Stopped-             flow kinetic studies on the interaction of a fluorescently-labeled              derivative of RPase with promoters offers the range of                          temperatures.  Thus, analysis of the data obtained in these studies             will provide detailed information about the molecular events that               occur in the enzyme during promoter complex formation and                       disscociation.  Moreover, because the fluorescently attached tag                appears to be sensitive to conformational changes in the enzyme,                these studies will provide information regarding structural                     alterations in the enzyme, these studies will provide information               regarding structural alterations in the enzyme during open promoter             complex formation.                                                              %%%                                                                             Highly specific interactions between proteins and nucleic acids are             crucial for a wide range of biological processes such as                        replication, transcription and translation.  An understanding of                these processes and of the reasons for their malfunctioning                     requires detailed information on the structures of the protein-                 nucleic complexes, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetics of                their formation.",
