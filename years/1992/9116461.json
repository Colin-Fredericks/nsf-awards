 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to the University Navstar                      Consortium (UNAVCO) located in Boulder, Colorado. UNAVCO is a                   consortium of 30 U.S. universities that manages a facility                      providing equipment and logistical assistance to earth scientists               making use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites for                research in crustal dynamics, earthquake, volcano, and global                   change research.                                                                     Using GPS, vector baselines between receivers separated by 100             kilometers or more are now being routinely measured with one                    centimeter (or 100 parts per billion) accuracy. Such measurements               can be completed using portable equipment in a few hours or less.               The ability to make such measurements has found immediate                       applications in research on global plate tectonics, earthquake                  mechanics, volcano monitoring, and regional tectonics.                               The UNAVCO facility offers a complete support program for                  university-based investigators including assistance in planning                 filed work, training of personnel, equipment, shipping, customs,                field operations, technical troubleshooting, data management,                   analysis and archiving. UNAVCO also represents the academic                     research community and acts as a central clearinghouse for                      information on the scientific applications of GPS. As a part of its             service to investigators, UNAVCO tests GPS equipment and                        techniques, and works to improve GPS surveying accuracy.",
