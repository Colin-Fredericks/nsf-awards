 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces biochemical engineering unit operations                 into the Lafayette College curriculum.  Three groups of                         students are affected.  All chemical engineering students learn                 to operate a computer controlled bioreactor in their dynamic                    design course.  Those chemical engineering majors interested in                 biochemical engineering as a career can perform sequential                      experiments on all unit operations common in the biotechnology                  industry, from growing cells in the bioreactor, to measuring                    product formation and enzyme kinetics, to separation and                        purification of the final product.  Liberal Arts students are                   introduced to the intriguing combination of biology and                         technology by performing simple experiments in an                               interdisciplinary course.  One of the goals of the project for                  chemical engineering students--a substantial number of whom go                  on to careers in medicine, biomedical engineering, and the                      pharmaceutical industry--is for them to have the opportunity                    for hands-on experience with equipment and techniques they are                  sure to encounter in their professional endeavors.",
