 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lipoxygenases are non-heme, non-sulfur iron dioxygenases which                  catalzye the hydroperoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids                       containing cis, cis-1, 4-pentadiene systems.  The object of these               studies is an understanding of the structure-function relationship              of lipoxygenase.  Sequences of 14 different plant and animal                    lipoxygenases share a common motif of histidine residues which are              candidates for a putative iron coordination site.  The iron binding             ability of the mutant constructions of the well-characterized                   isozyme (soybean L-1) in which the histidines are replaced with                 glutamine will be tested.  These mutants have been previously                   constructed and have been shown to have zero or diminished                      activities.  Three soybean seed lipoxygenases, L-1, L-2 and L-3,                despite their great homology, differ markedly in their enzymic                  characteristics e.g. substrate specificity, region-specificity, pH              optimum and secondary reactions.  Chimeric constructs of these                  enzymes will be examined to identify the basis for their                        differences.  The information sought should contribute to an                    understanding of the nature of the active site and the diversity of             kinetic characteristics of the primary and secondary reactions of               the isozymes and will ultimately facilitate interpretation of the               X-ray structure of lipoxygenase which is likely to become available             in the future.                                                                  %%%                                                                             The results will not only contribute to a basic understanding of                the mechanism of lipoxygenase but they will also be significant for             human health since lipoxygenases generate precursors of                         leukotrienes and other important physiological efforts in human                 tissue.  It is likely that much of what is learn from these studies             on the readily available soybean enzyme will be useful in the                   understanding of the animal enzymes.",
