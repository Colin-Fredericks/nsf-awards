 "awd_abstract_narration": "The enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the interconversion of                  the two forms of inorganic carbon, CO2 and HCO3, which                          predominate in aqueous media at physiological pH values.  In                    the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, one or more forms of                        carbonic anhydrase are components of a system for inorganic                     carbon acquisition and concentration. This system enables these                 organisms to efficiently utilize CO2 present at low levels,                     which could otherwise limit their growth.  A carbonic                           anhydrase-specific active site-directed radiolabeled                            photoaffinity reagent will be synthesized in order to study the                 physical relationship between the large and small subunits with                 respect to the active site of the enzyme, and as a tool in the                  identification and isolation of physiologically important                       intracellular  forms of carbonic anhydrase which are present in                 levels too low to be readily identified and quantified  by                      currently available methods.  This proposal will investigate                    the relationship between the subunit structure and disulfide                    bond reduction status on both the catalytic and inhibitor                       binding properties of the predominant extracellular form of                     carbonic anhydrase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  These                       studies will contribute to understanding the structure-function                 relationship of the extracellular carbonic anhydrase, and to                    the identification of other important components of the system                  by which Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells are able to                            efficiently concentrate inorganic carbon to provide CO2 for                     photosynthesis.",
