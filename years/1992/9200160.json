Eight highly qualified undergraduates will be recruited to conduct              research, at the Biomedical Research Institute laboratories on the              campus of the University of Wisconsin-Parkside in Kenosha.  Based               upon extensive experiences with undergraduate research together                 with active research programs, faculty representing the focus of                Molecular and Regulatory Biology will serve as potential project                supervisors.  This program is deigned to develop each participant's             intellectual confidence, technical competence and research                      independence via:  1) guidance and daily nurturing by active                    researchers in the areas of Molecular and Regulatory Biology, 2) a              program of specific goals for each student's research progress via              a meeting and seminar schedule plus instruction in literature                   search and seminar presentation techniques complementary to each                project, 3) leveraging of the NSF effort through a commitment to                support additional students each summer and/or to carry over                    meritorious students for a second summer of research using internal             funding, 4) Aggressive regional and in some cases national                      recruitment of superior candidates with special efforts to attract              underrepresented groups plus housing arrangements proximate to the              UW-P laboratories, and 5) immediate and long-term evaluation of the             NSF-REU experience.",
