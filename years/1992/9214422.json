These                                   renovations will provide for research projects in                               cytogenetics, molecular evolution and systematics,                              plant growth and development, and studies or                                    morphegenesis.  These renovations will serve as a                               foundation for further development of a research-                               active Department.

Hofstra                                    University is committed to providing opportunities                              for the less physically able student and for                                    attracting members of underrepresented groups into                              scholarly research.  The University has an                                      excellent record of providing opportunities to                                  minority students through special programs.",
