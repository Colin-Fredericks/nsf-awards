This is the second conference in a series of two.  The first               was held in Gaithersburg, Maryland during the summer of 1991.  This             conference, as was the first, is sponsored by the Operations                    Research Society of America, the German Operations Research                     Society, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and                with additional support from the National Science Foundation.  This             is an important opportunity to link theory and practice in                      manufacturing.",
