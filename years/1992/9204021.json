 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many scientific applications are currently structured as a                      series of computational steps, each of which is implemented by a                separate program with files being used to transmit data between                 the steps.  In this project, an alternative based on structuring                applications as heterogeneous distributed programs is proposed.                 Among the potential benefits of this approach are improved access               to remote high-performance machines, enhanced ability to interact               with the application, and increased flexibility for the                         applications designer.  These benefits can be achieved with                     little extra effort by using a system software infrastructure to                handle communication and heterogeneity transparently to the user.               The specific goal of this research is to develop new application                programming techniques and software support systems to facilitate               this type of structuring for scientific applications.  The first                part involves continuing work into adapting existing tools for                  this purpose using the Schooner RPC system, as well as                          investigating issues related to the construction of new                         application codes that can exploit these capabilities.  The                     second part involves determining appropriate characteristics for                a software system attuned to the needs of scientific                            applications, and then constructing such a system.  All of this                 work builds on previous research involving heterogeneous                        computing.",
