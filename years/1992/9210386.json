 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social aphids provide a new arena for the study of the evolution of             sterile altruistic castes.  Two basic issues that have not been                 addressed in any social aphid are the mechanism of origin of a                  discrete sterile caste and the relatedness of the defending                     individuals to their beneficiaries.  Molecular methods will be used             to test a specific hypothesis for the origin of a sterile caste in              some Pemphigus species.  Under this hypothesis, some individuals                are forced into sterility because they lack endosymbionts at birth.             The tests depend on methods for the molecular detection of                      sequences previously established as unique in aphid endosymbionts;              the hypothesis predicts that these are present in all individuals               except sterile defenders.  In addition, genetic fingerprinting                  methods will be developed and used to examine the genotypic                     composition of colonies of a social and non-social Pemphigus                    species.  In both segments of this project, previously existing                 laboratory cultures of Pemphigus clones will provide controls and               test material.  These methods will be useful in future                          investigations concerning the genetic structure of partially clonal             aphid populations.  The research involves an important group of                 insects which feed on native American trees.",
