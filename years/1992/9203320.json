 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to understand the role of recruitment in the population                dynamics of marine species which have high larval dispersal it is               necessary to understand the movement of the larvae, their                       geographic origin and the forces that control their local                       abundance.  Methods for tracking larval movements have been                     restricted to short time scales or within closed systems but their              application to high dispersal systems has been of limited value                 because of the difficulties with larval recovery.  The mussel                   Mytilus edulis consists of a complex of sibling species that                    hybridize in discrete areas of contact between the parental forms.              Individual mussel larvae can be genetically identified as having                originated from either of the parental population, or from                      populations that contain hybrids. Hybrid larvae can only have                   originated from populations that contained both parent taxa or F1               hybrids. Using this system it will be possible to obtain                        information on the origin of larvae at several geographic scales.               New techniques are required to genetically identify individual                  larvae.  The methods which will be developed in this research                   program will allow individual larvae to be assayed directly, with               minimal preparation and a high rate of processing.  Once the                    techniques have been developed it will be possible to identify the              geographic origin of dispersing or recruited larvae. Once developed             this new technique will be employed to study larval dispersal in                regions of contact between Mytilus populations.",
