 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study the formation of melanocyte cell                   hybrids which contain negative regulatory genes that suppress                   either the production of melanin or the production of basic                     fibroblast growth factor. Individual chromosomes from non-pigmented             cells will be transferred to melanocytes, and chromosomes from                  normal melanocytes will be transferred into melanoma cells.                     Techniques are available to form microcell hybrids which can then               be subjected to karyotypic analysis for identification of the                   individual chromosomes. Tissue specific extinguisher loci have not              been well characterized in melanocytes, although they have been                 characterized in liver cells. In liver cells, down-regulation of                target gene expression occurs at the mRNA level; similar                        experiments will be carried out in melanocytes.                                 %%%                                                                             Melanocytes produce the pigment melanin under closely regulated                 conditions. When melanocytes are converted to melanoma cells, which             are frequently cancerous, the production of melanin and of a growth             factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), is increased. This               proposal is to prepare microcell hybrids of melanoma cells                      containing individual chromosomes from normal melanocytes, in order             to isolate the specific genes that in normal cells suppress the                 production of melanin and of bFGF. The individual chromosomes will              be identified by standard karyotypic analysis. The molecular                    structure of the genes involved in suppression will then be                     determined.",
