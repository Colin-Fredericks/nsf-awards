 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geochemical and physiological processes mediated by magnetotactic               bacteria are not well understood despite the fact that these                    unusual procaryotes are ubiquitous in and easily collected from                 aquatic habitats.  Preliminary results with several new isolates of             magnetotactic bacteria strongly suggest that cells of these strains             are involved in the oxidation of reduced sulfur and perhaps iron                compounds.  Moreover, these results show that these strains can                 grow with reduced sulfur compounds as sole energy (electron)                    sources using carbon dioxide as the sole carbon source.  Thus, it               is likely that these new strains can grow chemolithoautotrophically             and perhaps mixotrophically as well.  Microbiological, chemical,                and biochemical strategies will determine the role of these new                 strains of magnetotactic bacteria in sulfur and iron cycling and                their chemolithoautotrophic potential.  The results obtained from               this study will be invaluable in understanding the overall                      physiology of magnetotactic bacteria, in ascertaining the                       geochemical roles magnetotactic bacteria play in nature, in the                 isolation of new strains, and ultimately in how they synthesize                 their magnetic mineral component.",
