 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous work on this project has demonstrated the                              self-oligomerization of trifluoromethylcopper to form                           CF3(CF2)nCu(n=1 to 16).  The use of \u0131CF3Cu! as a \u0131CF2! transfer                 agent with other perfluorinated organometallic reagents is                      planned, and the generality and mechanism of the \u0131CF2!                          insertion process will be investigated.  Alternative sources of                 \u0131CF2! will be studied for use with less reactive organometallic                 compounds.  A broad study of alpha-halogen effects in                           alpha-halo and alpha, alpha-dihaloperfluoro organometallic                      reagents and of the scope of cumulene formation will be done.                   Complementary to this approach is the synthesis and chemistry                   of perfluoro diene-ynes.  As an adjunct of the organometallic                   and phosphorus chemistry, a long range study will be made of                    the preparation of perfluoro-polyenes and the study of unique                   chemistry of these relatively unknown systems.  The development                 of cis- and trans-difluoroethylene synthons will be part of the                 synthetic methodology for F-polyenes. These will be utilized as                 new synthons for the stereospecific preparation of                              perfluorobutadiene derivatives.  In the area of ylide                           chemistry, a practical approach to functionalized fluoroolefin                  derivatives via an intramolecular Wadsworth-Emmons reaction                     using ylide/acylation methodology developed earlier will be                     undertaken.  Related work with alkylated fluorinated ylides is                  planned as a new and practical route to alpha-fluoromethylene                   ylides.  Finally, the study of new single electron transfer                     (SET) reactions will provide new or improved routes to                          fluoromethylene and difluoromethyl functionalized derivatives                   of biological interest.                                                                                                                                         With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                 research of Dr. Donald J. Burton at the University of Iowa.                     The studies will continue the development of new synthetic                      methodology for the introduction of fluorine into organic                       molecules and the development of the ofttimes unique chemistry                  that results.  This may lead to new kinds of chemicals and                      materials that should benefit research in biochemistry and                      medicine, as well as in the chemical industry.",
