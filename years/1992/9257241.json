 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports on-going research efforts on interactive  computational models which incorporate both randomness and  nondeterminism in novel ways.  A fundamental goal of the work is  to address what is probably the major open problem in computer  science:  how randomness and nondeterminism help in computation.  Representative problems in this area are stochastic games, automata  theory and random walks on graphs.  Stochastic games model a large  class of problems in optimization called decision problems under  uncertainty.  Finite state automata are studied with both nondeterministic and  random states in order to understand the difference between such  models and their deterministic counterparts.  New questions about random walks have been formulated on graphs that  are partly controlled by an adversary; in our scenario edges of the  graph are colored and the adversary can control the walk by specifying  which color edge is followed at a given step.  Further this award supports ongoing research regarding the need for a  more realistic theory of parallel computation.  The design and  implementation of algorithms on parallel machines is combined  with analysis of these algorithms on realistic models.  Two  algorithmic paradigms will be restudied:  dynamic programming and  branch and bound.  Emphasis will be on applications of dynamic  programming to problems in DNA sequence analysis and of branch and  bound algorithms to problems in combinatorial optimization.  Also   a new look is taken at what it means for a problem to be  ``inherently sequential''.",
