 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study several weak                         formulations of the motion of a singular surface by its mean                    curvature. Such motion arises in the theory of phase transitions.               The work is part of an ongoing project to reconcile the various                 mathematical models for the motion of phase boundaries. The                     principal investigator will study the existence of unit density                 flows, the convergence of systems of phase-field equations, and                 the existence and properties of self-similar solutions.                              This award will support research in the general area of                    differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry                is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space                and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                  the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of                a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                  these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                        structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                  the large scale structure of the universe.",
