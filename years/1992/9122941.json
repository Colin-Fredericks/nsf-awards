 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an effort to determine continental-scale and                    regional-scale sources of pollution aerosol collected at the GISP-2             and Dye-3 sites in Greenland.  It will make use of a                            chemically-based source apportionment technique known as receptor               modelling, which chemical signatures developed for regional-scale               sources in North America and Eurasia are applied to the analyses of             snow and ice samples.                                                                                                                                           Geographically specific industrialized regions display                          characteristic patterns of trace element composition of their                   aerosol emissions, which include contributions from power plants,               smelters, motor vehicles, biomass burning, etc.  Some rely on                   anomalously high concentrations of exotic trace elements such as                arsenic, indium, selenium, and vanadium, which are found in                     extremely low concentrations in Greenland.                                                                                                                      The project will make use of samples collected at the GISP-2 site               during the past two seasons, and will collect additional samples in             the summer of 1992.",
