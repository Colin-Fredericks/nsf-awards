 "awd_abstract_narration": "This purpose of this project is to produce a cadre of 96                        exemplary high school biology teachers for a cluster of                         urban, minority school districts.  Through a four week                          summer workshop,  six Saturday sessions and two classroom                       visits by university personnel, these teachers will acquire                     1) a strong knowledge and laboratory skills base in cell and                    molecular biology and in industrial and environmental                           microbiology; 2) an understanding of science process; 3)                        training in innovative instructional methods and curriculum                     design for teaching biology; and 4) a greater understanding                     of the barriers to achievement in biology faced by urban,                       minority students.                                                                                                                                              It is proposed that the teachers engage in a guided research                    experience during the summer workshop and in their                              classrooms.  It is also proposed that the teachers will                         develop and use new curricular materials that will foster                       student interest in biological sciences careers and prepare                     students to pursue a college major leading toward such a                        career.  The curricular materials will also be made                             available for replication in other districts.                                                                                                                   Cost sharing equals 11.2 % of the NSF award.",
