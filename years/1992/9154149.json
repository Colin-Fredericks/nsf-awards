 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ATLAST Project will sponsor a series of ten regional                        workshops during the summers of 1992 and 1993 on the use of                     software in teaching linear algebra.  Workshop participants                     will learn how to use existing commercial linear algebra                        software packages and how to effectively incorporate these                      packages into their courses. Participants will also be expected                 to design their own computing exercises and projects at a level                 suitable for assignment in an undergraduate linear algebra                      class.  These exercises will be class tested during the school                  year following the workshop, revised if necessary, and then                     submitted to the project director for inclusion in a database.                  The databases from each of the summer workshops will be edited,                 printed as manuals, and distributed to the workshop                             participants. The project director will select the best                         exercises from the manuals for inclusion in a special ATLAST                    Project book which will be published by one of the mathematics                  societies.",
