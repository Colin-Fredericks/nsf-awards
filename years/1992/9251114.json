 "awd_abstract_narration": "Make mathematics courses more relevant|  Use technology                         effectively|  Have students learn experientially and                            collaboratively|  Throughout the nation these have been clear                   and urgent calls.  A course for liberal arts majors (Math 1010)                 is being developed to address these issues.  This four-                         semester-hour course includes a two-hour laboratory each week                   in which students learn to solve problems.  They generate data                  and have group discussions comparing alternative strategies for                 solving a problem.  Then they give both written and oral                        presentations of their solutions. Computer are used for                         graphing data, for doing statistics, for solving linear                         programming and financial problems, and then for integrating                    all of these into written reports.  Students leave this course                  with an appreciation of how mathematics and computers are used                  as tools in modeling and problem solving.  The goal is that                     eventually 1,000 Appalachian students will take this course per                 year, and that this course will serve as a model for other                      schools.",
