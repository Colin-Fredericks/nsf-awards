 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physics of disordered, correlated Bose sytems constitutes a                 major challenge.  Recently a density controlled superfluid                      transition was observed in helium-four absorbed in porous materials             with a superfluid density exponent contrdicting earlier theories;               new types of scaling behavior of the resistivity have been seen in              disordered superconducting films and wires; and the observation of              a possible universal conductance in granular superconducting films              has attracted considerable excitement.  A related problem of                    primary importance is the vortex state of the high temperature                  superconductors, where an unconventional, vortex-glass phase has                been observed in some materials.  At the same time, the discovery               of heavy fermion and oxide superconductors has driven a substantial             improvement in numerical techniques and also led to genuinely new               analytical approaches to strongly correlated fermions.  These                   advanceshave yet to be applied to the interacting boson problem.                The research will apply Quantum Monte Carlo, the Schwinger boson                approach and the perturbative scaling methids of localization                   theory to explore the quantum phase transitions taking place in                 helium-four absorbed in porous media and granular superconductors,              as modeled by a disordered, interacting boson Hamiltonian.  The                 disorder will be handled by methods which were successful in the                spin-glass problem, among others finite size scaling of                         appropriately chosen dimensionless quantities, and a suitable                   version of the maximum entropy method.                                          %%%                                                                             Theoretical research will be conducted using numerical and                      analytical techniques to study the behavior of disordered,                      interacting many particle systems which obey Bose statistics.  New              methods will be applied to describe such diverse physical systems               as properties of helium absorbed in porous materials and the                    behavior of high temperature superconductors.",
