 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have determined that two important magnetospheric boundary                   regions on the side, the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) and                 the cusp, can be identified from energetic particle observations                as well as from observations of magnetosheath-energy particle                   precipitation on polar-orbiting satellites.  We propose to                      analyze simultaneous observations of magnetosheath energy                       particles obtained from the S3-3 satellite in order to identify                 these boundary regions, to analyze processes occurring within                   these boundary regions, and to investigate the mapping of these                 regions from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.  We will                      compare the identification obtined using the criteria developed                 be Newell and Meng \u01311988! for magnetosheath-energy particles.  In               this way, we will investigate the accuracy of both techniques as                well as determine the advantages of using energetic particle                    measurements to supplement and verify the identification                        obtainable using the Newell and Meng criteria.  In addition,                    using the measured angular distributions of particles, we will                  investigate the extent to which the LLBL lies on closed field                   lines and estimate the locations of auroral acceleration regions                relative to each of the magnetospheric boundary regions and to                  the open-closed field line boundary.  We also propose to                        determine criteria for distinguishing between precipitation from                the LLBL and that from the plasma sheet boundary layer.  We will                use the criteria to study the important transition between these                two boundary layers as mapped to the ionosphere.  Using the                     electric and magnetic field data from S3-3, we plan to study the                spatial relations between the convection reversal, field-ligned                 currents, the different boundary regions, and the open-closed                   field line boundary.  In this way, we hope to gain significant                  information on the extent to which the magnetospheric electric                  field is generated by reconnection versus viscous interaction and               on the generation regions for day side field-aligned currents.                  Finally, using precipitation data from the identically                          instrumented, almost co-orbiting, DMSP F6 and F8 satellites, we                 will pursue the separation of temporal and spatial effects over                 latitudinal scale sizes as small as 10km within the day side                    boundary layers.",
