 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between metropolitan labor demand and urban poverty         has received considerable attention in light of recent concern about the        urban underclass.  Current theory focuses on mismatches between the             location and skills of the urban poor on the one hand and the location          and skills of metropolitan area jobs on the other.  An overall approach         to labor market conditions suggests that changes in both labor demand           and labor supply have a direct effect on labor market conditions for the        urban poor.  This project will further an understanding of urban poverty        by estimating how metropolitan labor demand affects an individual's             probability of suffering persistent poverty.  These effects will be             examined for different groups of the poor and non-poor:  welfare                mothers, long-term jobless adult men, children from welfare dependent           families, and the working poor.  Data for the project will come from the        1968-87 individual file of the Panel Survey on Income Dynamics and will         be used to estimate  how metropolitan labor demand shifts affect the            earnings, employment activity, and wages of poor and non-poor residents         and how demand shocks affect an individual's probability of being poor.         The research will follow the same individuals over time, examining how          their incomes and poverty status change in response to changes in local         labor demand.  A variety of labor demand and supply shocks will be              considered, such as overall metropolitan area employment change, change         in employment by industry, and the geographical distribution of                 employment within metropolitan areas.                                              This project should provide important information about how regional         labor demand conditions affect poor individuals.  The research should           indicate whether anti-poverty policies should include efforts to                increase demand for the labor of the poor or whether other anti-poverty         policies should receive greater emphasis.  This project will be the             first to follow the same set of individuals over time, and it is the            first to focus on how metropolitan employment demand shocks affect the          poor.  The results should provide sophisticated analyses of labor demand        effects on distinct groups of the poor.  As such the project results            should form the basis for policy prescriptions targeted to meet the             needs of specific segments of the urban poor.",
