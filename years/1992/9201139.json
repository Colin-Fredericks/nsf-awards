 "awd_abstract_narration": "A comprehensive computer database to the world's                           orthopteroid insect species (cockroaches, grasshoppers, katydids,               mantids, cave crickets, etc.) is being developed at the Academy                 of Natural Sciences. Both living and fossil species will be                     included.  Presently the file includes over 21,000 species and                  133,000 literature records.  The larger goal, of which this                     project is the first part, is to produce a global, taxonomically                oriented, multimedia (text, graphics, sound) computer database                  which will aid taxonomists and other biologists who wish to know                which taxa occur in their regions, how to identify them, and what               their ecological role is.  It will be especially valuable to                    systematists and managers of insect collections who must struggle               with a large and scattered literature.                                               The present project will focus on the North American                       grasshoppers.  This group has been the subject of two books                     published by the principal investigator, Dr. Daniel Otte - The                  North American Grasshoppers.  Volumes I and II were funded by                   NSF.  The data assembled in this work will be the foundation for                the publishing of volumes 3 and 4 of the series.  Volume 3 will                 include the economically important subfamily of Melanoplinae                    grasshoppers.",
