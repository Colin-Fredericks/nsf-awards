The dictionaries, each to contain                         approximately 8,000 entries, will draw upon all available lexical               and textual materials:  data collected by the PI over the past                  twenty-five years; data collected by anthropologists earlier in                 the century; and data in historical sources.  Three months of                   additional field work will fill in lacunae in the data base.                    Although there is no dialectal diversity within Arikara today,                  there are two dialects of Pawnee still spoken--South Band and                   Skiri-- and the Pawnee dictionary will account for the                          differences between these two forms of speech.                                       The project, part of a larger effort to document Pawnee and                Arikara as fully as possible, will result in the first reference                dictionaries ever compiled for them.  The dictionaries, moreover,               will provide essential data for the comparative study of the                    Caddoan language family and the interrelationships of the Caddoan               languages with other genetically related languages families in                  the New World.  They will also serve as reference tools for                     scholars and in language classes in the Arikara and Pawnee                      communities.",
