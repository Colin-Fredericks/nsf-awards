 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Faculty Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers                  recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in teaching and             scholarship, as well as potential research, the academic                        profession, and the education of future scientists and engineers.               Dr. Cooper's research under this award is directed at understanding             the interactions of energetic ion beams with clean and adsorbate-               covered single crystal metal surfaces.                                               The dynamics of hyperthermal ion-surface scattering (incident              energies below 500 eV) are of fundamental interest because it is in             the hyperthermal energy regime that the transition occurs from                  thermal scattering,in which the ion interacts simultaneously with               the entire surface to keV scattering, where the ion undergoes a                 series of sequential binary collisions with individual surface                  atoms. Hyperthermal scattering dynamics are also of practical                   importance since this energy regime is used in technological                    applications such as reactive ion etching and ion beam assisted                 epitaxy. To study these dynamics, well-characterized ion beams are              scattered from clean and adsorbate-covered metal surfaces.                      Particular emphasis is placed on understanding aspects of the                   scattering dynamics, such as energy transfer to the surface and                 particle trapping, and on understanding mechanisms of ion-surface               charge transfer. The initial studies will use alkali ion beams                  since the relative simplicity of alkali ion-surface reactions                   permits detailed modeling of the scattering and charge transfer                 dynamics.                                                                            Scattering dynamics studies are currently underway for Na+                 scattering from Cu(001), and will be extended to other alkalis and              to other beam species, such as oxygen and nitrogen. Investigations              to determine the mechanisms of ion-surface charge transfer are                  currently underway for incident Li+, Na+, and K+. They will be                  extended to other incident species, in particular atomic and                    molecular oxygen.                                                                    A probe that is complementary to ion scattering for studying               local atomic and electronic surface properties is the scanning                  tunneling microscope (STM). STM will be used in ultra high vacuum               to study tunneling mechanisms on metal surfaces, the effect of                  adsorbates on the electronic structure at metal surfaces, and                   diffusion on metal surfaces.",
