 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preliminary analysis of mineralogical trends through time in               two large clastic wedges in the northwestern Gulf of New Mexico                 Basin (Wilcox and lower Claiborne Groups), and time-equivalent                  upper Paleocene-lower Eocene strata in Laramide basins of the                   Southern Rocky Mountains, suggests that the two-phase uplift                    history of Laramide orogeny described by Chapin and Cather (1983)               may be recorded by detrital mineralogy.  Temporal changes in                    composition also indicate that changing climate played a role in                the evolution detrital mineralogy.                                                   The proposal is to study the temporal changes of detrital and              diagenetic mineralogy in the Wilcox and lower Claiborne Groups of               the northwestern Gulf of Mexico Basin, and coeval sediments in                  Laramide basins of the Southern Rocky Mountains.  This information              will provide a test of the theory that pulses of intracontinental               Laramide tectonism are recorded by episodes of deltaic-wedge                    progradation in the Gulf of Mexico Basin.  In particular, we will               address the question:  Is the response of delta growth geologically             instantaneous, or does a geologically significant lag-time exist                between filling of basins adjacent to interior uplifts and the                  deposition of associated sediment at the continental margin?                    Palynological analysis of sample intervals will place the trend of              mineralogical changes within a time framework.  This temporally                 constrained analysis of mineralogical changes will allow an                     assessment of synchroneity between interior-continental orogeny and             continental-margin sedimentation.",
