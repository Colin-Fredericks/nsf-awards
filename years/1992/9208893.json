 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information about diverse environmental factors, such as day length             (i.e., season), time of day, temperature, availability of food                  and/or water, presence of conspecifics that may be either                       competitors for limited resources (e.g. food) or potential mates,               is processed and integrated by the central nervous system.                      Utilizing both this environmental input and information about the               individual's internal status (e.g. nutritional, sexual maturity),               the brain sets in motion a variety of coordinated adaptive                      responses that involve the neuroendocrine system.  The goal of Dr.              Ball's research is to examine the neuroendocrine integration of                 environmental information regulating reproduction.  He has selected             a species that show dramatic changes over the course of a year in               their propensity to exhibit an endocrine response to photoperiodic              stimuli that regulate the timing of reproduction.  Dr. Ball                     proposes that the neuropeptide gonadotrophin-releasing hormone                  (GnRH) is involved in the integration of signals.  He will                      determine whether GnRH changes in specific brain structures in                  response to seasonal variation.  Moreover, he will examine how                  extra-photoperiodic stimuli and physiological conditions affect                 reproductive activity as measured by plasma hormone levels, gonadal             growth as well as GnRH neurochemistry.  These studies should                    provide new insight into both how the central nervous system                    assimilates the varied stimuli that regulate reproduction and the               nature of seasonal plasticity in the neurochemical systems involved             in mediating variation in responses to stimuli.  Understanding the              brain's integration with physiological and behavioral systems can               lead to the elucidation of basic principles that underlie the                   conservation and restoration of biological diversity.  Moreover,                it could provide a more thorough understanding of how species adapt             to adverse environmental changes that may prove important to human              adaptation in this changing world.",
