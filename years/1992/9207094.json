 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study a stochastic                         description of mass transport on fluid flows.  The model is none                of birth and death on a stochastic flow, originating in the work                of Cinlar and Kao.  The aim is to develop a Girsanov                            transformation for this model as needed in likelihood estimation.               He will then implement this idea in the context of transient                    tracers on fluid flows.  In addition, he will explore the                       implications of these results for the adaptive sampling of fluid                flows where the goal is to estimate drift rates and other                       parameters.                                                                          The transport of materials by fluid flows is of interest in                many scientific fields.  For example, oceanographers study the                  movements of drifters and chemical tracers in learning about                    ocean currents.  In this project, the principal investigator will               study probability models for such transport.  In this context he                will address problems of statistical inference such as                          forecasting the spread of materials on ocean flows.  The results                should be of interest to scientists working with transport                      problems.",
