 "awd_abstract_narration": "Substrate adhesion molecules (SAMs) belong to a family of adhesive              glycoproteins which occur in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of a                variety of organisms.  Vitronectin (VN) is a SAM that has been                  implicated in cell adhesion and migration.  The PI's have                       established that a homolog to VN occurs in the primary cell wall                of plants, and have evidence for its role in facilitating pollen                tube extension in the style.  The proposed research is a multi-                 faceted approach to understanding the expression, localization, and             function of vitronectin-like molecules during plant development.                The experiments proposed will specifically test the role of VN-                 like molecules during pollination.  Immunocytochemical and                      fluorescence staining techniques will be used to examine the                    relationship between components of the cytoskeleton, VN-like                    molecules, and VN receptors (integrins) during pollen tube                      elongation and during shoot ontogeny.  Synthetic peptides that are              known to mediate adhesion of VN to its integrin will be used to                 determine their effect on pollen tube elongation in vivo and in                 vitro.  cDNA clones that encode VN-like proteins will be isolated               and characterized.  The levels of VN RNA during plant development               will be examined by RNA blot and in situ hybridizations.  The role              of VN-like proteins during plant development will be tested by                  overexpressing and underexpressing VN RNAs using chimeric gene                  constructs in transgenic plants.",
