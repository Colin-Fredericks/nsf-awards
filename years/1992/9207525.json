Problems need to be                                                                                                    addressed for the synthesis of these two materials because:                     (1) Solid polymer electrolytes have a much lower conductivity                                                                                                   than conventional liquid or gel electrolytes.  The resistance                                                                                                   of the polymer film can be reduced by making the film very                      thin.  It is difficult to make ultra-thin polymeric films,                      though, that are free of pin-holes.  (2)  The rate capability                                                                                                   of solid state lithium batteries can be improved by using                       organo-sulfur and di-sulfur containing polymers as the cathode                                                                                                  material instead of intercalation compounds (such as TiS2),                                                                                                     which are presently used in most thin, rechargeable batteries.

The PIs plan to develop plasma polymerization techniques to                                                                                                     produce solid polymer electrolytes and polymer redox cathodes                                                                                                   for thin, solid-state, rechargeable, alkaline batteries.

Substituted phenolic                       groups will be incorporated into the siloxane plasma polymers                                                                                                   (by co-sublimation / plasma polymerization techniques) to                       prepare the single ion (lithium, sodium or potassium)                           conducting electrolytes.

Simple batteries based on these plasma polymerized films will                                                                                                   be constructed to test the applicability of these materials.",
