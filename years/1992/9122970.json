 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethology, the biological study of behavior, emerged as a major                  new scientific discipline in the first two decades after World                  War II, building upon conceptual and methodological foundations                 established by Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen in the 1930s.  In               the post-war period, increasing numbers of researchers were drawn               to the study of behavior, the primary institutional structures of               the discipline of ethology were created, biennial international                 congresses served to define and guide the ethological community,                and ethology's early conceptual foundations underwent elaboration               and alteration.  Dr. Burkhardt's goal is to describe and analyze                ethology's development from 1945 to 1965.  Taking a comparative                 and \"ecological\" approach, he is exploring how the guiding                      issues, concepts, and practices of ethology evolved as the                      original founders of the discipline and a new generation of                     investigators established research centers in Germany, Holland,                 Great Britain, and the United States and responded to the                       challenges and opportunities provided by contact with                           investigators from other disciplines.  This study builds on Dr.                 Burkhardt's earlier research on animal behavior studies before                  World War II.  This research is aimed at presenting the first                   systematic treatment of the history of ethology in this century.",
