 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Palmer Station Antarctic Marine LTER (Long-Term Ecological                  Research) project provides an excellent opportunity for                         undergraduate participation in research.  All research within the               antarctic marine LTER relates to a central hypothesis:  that                    interannual variation in the extent of pack ice affects all                     levels in the food web, from phytoplankton to apex predators.                   The LTER and the Research Experiences for Undergraduates programs               have several common objectives which are achieved by                            undergraduates participating in research activities.  These                     objectives include:  enhancing undergraduate education,                         attracting students to marine science, and training the next                    generation of scientists.  Undergraduates with an interest in                   marine sciences will have the opportunity to experience many                    aspects of an interdisciplinary project which involves current                  and evolving techniques.  They will participate both in the field               seasons in Antarctica, and in the laboratory work in universities               in the United States.  Areas of research available to REU                       students who participate in the Palmer antarctic marine LTER                    include:  remote sensing; hydrographic and optical                              characteristics of the water column; phytoplankton physiology and               production; distribution and recruitment of zooplankton and                     nekton; and analysis of zooplankton and nekton collected by                     seabirds.  During this experience we expect students to move from               a broad overview and dependent status to narrower focus and                     independent projects with their REU advisors.",
