 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biology of one of the oldest and most successful                       predators, sharks, has often intrigued scientists and amateurs.                 Sharks and their relatives, the skates and rays, originated from                bony fish ancestors some 400 million years ago.  Today they are                 the dominant predators of the oceans.  Despite great interest in                their feeding behaviors, there exists scant scientific knowledge                of their feeding mechanisms.  The anatomy of the heads and jaws                 of arguably the most successful group, the requiem or                           carcharhiniform sharks (tiger, lemon, hammerhead sharks), has                   been little studied.                                                                 Dr. Philip Motta of the University of South Florida, with                  assistance from colleagues at the Mote Marine Laboratory and the                Florida Institute of Technology, is studying the feeding                        mechanics and cranial anatomy of two groups of sharks with                      contrasting modes of feeding.  These are biting and gouging lemon               sharks, and suction and crushing nurse sharks.  Descriptive study               of jaw musculature and cranial nerves will be supplemented with                 high-speed photography of feeding behaviors and electromyography,               to measure electrical signals controlling feeding movements.                    Detailed examination of the functional morphology of sharks will                help in understanding the evolution of contrasting feeding styles               in these marine predators, and in general will improve                          understanding of the origins of feeding behaviors in early                      vertebrate groups.",
