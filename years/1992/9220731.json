 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to determine whether a                          contractual approach to the labor market can help explain the                   movements of wages and hours worked over the business cycle.                    Important, preliminary findings using the contract approach have                already shown great promise for analyzing these movements.  The                 project will involve extending this preliminary work in several                 directions in order to further assess the empirical relevance of                contracts in explaining labor market outcomes.  Firstly, the type               of contract model which is most consistent with individual level                wage data will be developed and tested.  Secondly, research will                focus on how to estimate the intertemporal substitutability of                  leisure when employment relations are governed by long term                     contracts.  Thirdly, individual level data from several different               counties will be used to investigate how labor market flexibility               can be compared when employment relations are governed by                       contracts.  Finally, a market clearing contract model will be                   analyzed to determine whether such a model can explain the                      aggregate behavior of employment levels over the business cycle.                This project is important because it will provide useful insights               into the nature of the movement of wages subject to contractual                 relations over the business cycle.",
