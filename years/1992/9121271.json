 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a general need for a better understanding of the                       combustion processes occurring in engine systems.  In particular,               the detailed physical and chemical processes important in engine                ignition, flame propagation, and knock need to be clarified, and                fuel property effects and interactions determined.  In an effort                to address these needs, a joint research program between Tianjin                University and Drexel University was initiated in March 1989                    under NSF sponsorship; Good progress has been made on this                      program and will be continued under this award.                                                                                                                 The work is being carried out by separating and individually                    studing the two major types of processes occurring in engine                    systems, i.e., the chemical processes and the physical processes.               Drexel University is concentrating on the chemical processes,                   while Tianjin University is concentrating on the physical                       processes.  This division of labor builds upon the strengths and                programs at each university and effectively leverages existing                  resources.  The Drexel effort is focusing on low and intermediate               temperature oxidation of hydrocarbons using a variety of                        laboratory systems, including static and flow reactor systems, to               isolate relevant chemical processes.  The Tianjin effort is                     focusing on physical factors, such as surface deposits, test                    transfer and fluid flow effects, utilizing a variety of                         laboratory and engine test facilities.  Coordination of the                     individual research effort is leading to identification of                      important interactions and incorporation of critical experiments                for studying these interactions.  Successful completion of the                  research program will lead to a better understanding of the                     important chemistry and physics in engine combustion and                        autoignition processes, and consequently to improved engine                     performance.",
