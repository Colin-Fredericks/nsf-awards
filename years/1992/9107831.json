 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. John                 H. Nordin of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and                      Professor Franco Giorgi at the University of Pisa.  The objectives              of the project are to  develop techniques for dissection and fixation           of Blatella germanica eggs/embryos; to establish a procedure for                injecting radiolabeled yolk granules into B. germanica eggs; to                 investigate temporal aspects of expression of Vt processing                     proteinases and the fate of Vt processing peptides in C. morosus                and B. germanica embryos during early development; and to                       explore approaches for isolating vitellophages and characterizing               their plasma membrane.  The study is significant because it will                increase our understanding of two \"universal\" constituents of insect            eggs, yolk granules and vitellophages and because it addresses the              fate of Vt processing peptides in the developing embryo.  The                   research goal is to understand how insect Vt utilization is                     controlled at the cellular and molecular levels.                                                                                                                The PI will interact directly for an extended period with a leading             research group that is investigating similar aspects in a closely               related orthopteran.  Dr. Giorgi is an internationally recognized               researcher in the field of insect vitellogenesis and embryology.                Giorgi's group has studied embryo development of orthopteran                    stick insects, especially Carausius morosus, which shares a number              of characteristics with B. germanica.  Another benefit will accrue              from employing electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry to                   advance the project.  Overall, this project will provide an excellent           opportunity to gain new insights into the principal investigators'              respective experimental systems and for mutually beneficial                     scientific interaction.",
