 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discovery of high temperature oxide superconductivity and the               related anomalous properties of the normal phase of these materials             has posed a challenging set of problems for the condensed matter                theorist.  Called into question are the traditional concepts and                methods of band structure and fermi liquid theory, the conventional             pairing theory of superconductivity, the fundamental mechanism                  leading to superconductivity, etc.  There are two limiting                      approaches to these problems; one begins with a delocalized or                  itinerant electron description while the other assumes that to zero             order the electrons are spacially localized.  While the physically              relevant situation remains unclear, it appears likely that an                   intermediate situation is realized in nature.  Their program is                 designed to understand the full range of localized to itinerant                 behavior, although their emphasis is on the itinerant limit, with               many other groups working on the localized limit.",
