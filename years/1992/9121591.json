Phosphorus chemistry                         includes a plethora of exciting areas of research.  The                         organization of the Conference will allow for discussion of a                   broad range of themes including the synthesis of organic                        phosphorus compounds, the chemistry of phosphorus compounds                     with unusual coordination and bonding characteristics, the                      chemistry of coordination compounds involving directly bound                    phosphorus ligands, the biochemistry of organophosphorus                        compounds, the chemistry of phosphates, physical methods and                    theoretical chemistry as applied to phosphorus, and new                         polymeric materials containing phosphorus. The Conference                       affords a unique opportunity for U.S. Chemists, including young                 investigators, to interact with their counterparts from around                  the world for an intense interchange of knowledge and to                        prepare the foundation for long term international                              collaborations.                                                                 %%%",
