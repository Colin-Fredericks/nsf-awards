 "awd_abstract_narration": "RD Instruments will undertake an SBIR Phase II proposal to                      continue development and commercialization of a phased array                    acoustic Doppler current profiler (PAADCP).  This company                       has pioneered the use of acoustic Doppler techniques for a                      variety of ocean science and applied oceanographic                              applications.                                                                                                                                                   The project will reduce the size and weight of presently                        available instruments and make them more versatile by                           developing a single phased array to replace the four                            independent piston transducers that are now required.  A 38                     kHz phased array transducer will have a significantly                           smaller diameter and be lighter in weight than the four 75                      kHz transducers now used.  A fifth beam can also be formed                      to add a new capability of measuring vertical velocities as                     well as lateral velocities.  Its smaller flat shape will                        make it easier to mount in ships and elsewhere.                                 Additionally, it is anticipated that it will have nearly                        double the profiling range of present instruments.                                                                                                              To achieve the objectives, several tasks will be undertaken.                    These will include a design trade-off study to validate                         theoretical models developed during Phase I concerning the                      ceramic geometries of the transducer and their resulting                        beam patterns.  Broadband technology options will be                            examined for implementation.  The 38.5 kHz ceramic                              transducers will be designed and packaged along with the                        electronics and data management system.  Signal processing                      algorithms will be developed.  There will also be an                            extensive testing program in laboratory tanks and at sea in                     collaboration with academic ocean scientists.  If                               successful, this new PAADCP could be the next generation                        acoustic profiling system and will have broad applications                      on U.S. and foreign research vessels and in offshore                            commercial applications as well.",
