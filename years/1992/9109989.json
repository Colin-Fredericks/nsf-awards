 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for a cooperative research program                  involving the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in the United                     States and the Port and Harbor Research Institute (PHRI) in                     Japan.  Support from the National Science Foundation is for the                 U.S. portion of the work, while a companion proposal from PHRI                  requests funds from the Japanese Science and Technology Agency                  for the Japanese component.  On the U.S. side, the principal                    investigators have many years experience with autonomous vehicles               and computer-controlled walking machines.  On the Japanese side,                PHRI has developed Aquarobot, the first autonomous underwater                   walking robot.  This machine was designed specifically for                      unmanned inspection of sea-floor building sites and foundations.                It is proposed to use the capabilities of NPS in the fields of                  artificial intelligence, robotics, computer graphics, and                       computer systems architecture, to extend the currently available                theory for simulation and control of robotic vehicles to                        encompass the case of subsea walking machines.  This theory will                be validated by physical experiments with Aquarobot, and is                     expected to result in significant improvements in the performance               of this vehicle in practical seafloor mapping applications.  In                 addition, the theoretical and experimental findings of this                     research should be of value in supporting the subsequent design                 of more advanced subsea walking machines.",
