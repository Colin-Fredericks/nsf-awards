 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to clarify the nature and dynamics               of international cooperation in exchange rate management among the              three major industrialized countries, namely the United States,                 Japan and Germany.  The currencies of these three countries, the                dollar, yen and mark, have been floating against one another since              the early 1970s, but the exchange rates among them have been                    unstable and saw major misalignments in the early 1980s, leading                to a greater concern for the possibility of international                       cooperation to stabilize exchange rates and prevent misalignments.                                                                                              There is some evidence that the three countries have been trying                to coordinate their exchange rate policies systematically since the             mid-1980s, but except for some journalistic accounts of                         coordination, not much is known about how and why cooperation takes             place.  This project is the first major attempt to systematically               analyze the causal structure of exchange rate cooperation.                                                                                                      The project covers the entire period of floating exchange rates and             uses the data on foreign exchange market intervention published by              the Federal Reserve Board and the German Bundesbank and estimated               data for Japan.  Other standard economic statistics available from              national and international sources and political variables which                are relatively easily observable are also used.                                                                                                                 The project is significant in the sense that it is the first                    scientific (statistical) attempt to explain exchange rate policy                cooperation among the three key countries of enormous economic and              political importance.  If successfully executed, it will not only               contribute to our understanding of the nature of the current                    exchange rate system and exchange rate policies but also contribute             to our understanding of international economic cooperation in                   general.",
