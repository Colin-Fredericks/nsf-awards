 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new Social and Behavioral Sciences Computer Laboratory at                  the New Community College of Baltimore will introduce students                  to computer-based social science research.  Although science is                 central to the social sciences, introductory courses typically                  offer static recitations of conventional social science                         knowledge, whereas what students need to learn are the methods                  of scientific inquiry.  The curricular plan for the lab is                      based on this and three other realities of higher education for                 the 21st century: 1) adult students learn differently from                      their younger counterparts; 2) higher education must develop                    self-directed learners; and 3) Students must become computer                    literate.  Higher education is attracting older students with                   life experience who achieve better when they complete real                      tasks, as opposed to simulation and exercises.  This kind of                    self-directed scientific inquiry is the centerpiece of the                      Social Science department's curricular renaissance, which                       includes the conversion of introductory social science classes                  from lecture courses to science lab courses.",
