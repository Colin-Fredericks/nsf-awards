Little                                            or no research has been directed                                                toward this question.  Transient                                                populations are defined as persons                                              who are not in the community where                                              they normally reside at the time                                                they initiate disaster evacuation                                               behavior.  There are at least four                                              sub-types:  tourists, business                                                  travellers, migrant workers, and                                                people in the process of relocating                                             (including the homeless).  The                                                  research has five objectives:  (1)                                              to describe the sequence of behavior                                            that culminates in actual evacuation                                            from disaster sites among transient                                             populations; (2) to describe the                                                range of variation that may exist                                               among these behavioral sequences                                                among population sub-types, urban-                                              rural event locations, and disaster                                             phases (i.e., pre or post-impact                                                evacuation); (3) to identify factors                                            that account for the variation in                                               these behavioral sequences, e.g.,                                               disaster warning receiver                                                       characteristics, warning message                                                characteristics, social group                                                   qualities, organizational qualities                                             and community characteristics;                                                  (4) document perceptions of                                                     transients who have been disaster                                               victims regarding evacuation                                                    procedures implemented by                                                       governmental agency representatives                                             and private sector organizational                                               executives; and (5) formulate policy                                            recommendations for emergency                                                   managers and business executives.                                               In accordance with disaster design                                              requirements, field interviews will                                             be conducted following major                                                    disasters resulting from earthquakes                                            and other agents in eight locations                                             wherein large numbers of transients                                             have evacuated.",
