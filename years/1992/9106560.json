 "awd_abstract_narration": "The continuing interest in information retrieval systems is based             upon the need to cope with the massive problems associated with                 storage, access, and retrieval of information.  It is clear that                text processing is a vast area, which encompasses information                   retrieval, is of prime importance in computing and beyond, and that             it also relates to many aspects of computing, including                         architecture, data and file structures, and, of late, graphics and              interface design.  The ACM/SIGIR International Conference on                    Research and Development in Information Retrieval (ICRDIR) is the               premier conference concerned with the vital area of information                 access and retrieval as it effects the important issues in text                 processing.  The topics at ACM/SIGIR are highly interdisciplinary.              At least ten graduate students from different disciplines in                    various universities across the country are invited to participate              in the conference, based on submitted papers, in order to be able               to present their work and be exposed to scholars from all over the              world doing parallel work.  The students' participation offers them             the opportunity of getting wide feedback on their ideas, and on the             other hand enriches the conference by their innovative ideas.",
