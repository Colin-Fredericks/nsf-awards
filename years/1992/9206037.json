 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmogenic nuclides provide an important tool for determining              the time a rock has been exposed to cosmic rays on the Earth's                  surface and also for determining erosion rates of geomorphic                    surfaces.  Several important applications have already been                     demonstrated:  dating past glacial episodes from exposure ages of               rocks on moraines, dating volcanic eruptions, and dating meteor                 crater impacts.  Although these studies have been successful in                 producing semi-quantitative results, reliable interpretation                    requires a better understanding of the fundamentals of production               mechanisms of cosmogenic nuclides.  The three aspects of surface                exposure dating that have been studied least are the dependence of              the cosmic ray flux on latitude, the dependence of the production               rates on the rock matrix, and the dependence of production rates                on the geometry of the rock.  The limited data available on the                 cosmic ray flux does not include important effects of the                       air/ground boundary.  This proposal requests funding to measure                 10Be, 26Al, and 36Cl depth profiles in several rocks of same age                and in the same location but of different lithology using                       accelerator mass spectrometry.  The latitude correction will be                 investigated using granitic rocks of same age, but from different               latitudes.  All rocks will be dated independently and will show                 glacial polish to rule out erosion.  A production rate model will               be developed using Monte Carlo particle transport codes and                     measurements will be compared with theoretical values.  The                     production rate model developed will then be available for others               to predict surface production rates in other rocks of different                 lithology, other geometries, and other latitudes.",
