 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Robert Boutilier is a professor of geology at                               Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts.  He has                             organized a three year effort, in collaboration with the                        Massachusetts Audubon Society, to help local school                             districts develop outdoor science education as an integral                      part of their elementary school science curriculum.                             Approximately 120 teachers will have two-week summer                            workshop experiences at one of several Audubon nature                           centers, where they will learn to develop instructional                         activities based on outdoor habitats close to their schools.                    Staff from the College and nature centers will work with                        these teachers during the academic year to help them refine                     their use of local environments for instructional purposes.                     The region covered by this project will include much of                         southeastern Massachusetts, extending from Boston through                       Brockton, New Bedford and Fall River to Cape Cod.                                                                                                               The proposed teacher enhancement project will establish an                      in-the-environment science curriculum for southeastern                          Massachusetts.  Teachers will receive training in the                           content and instructional methods necessary to help design                      and implement this new curriculum. More than 32 local school                    districts will benefit from this project.                                                                                                                       Cost sharing amounts to 33% of the NSF contribution to the                      project.",
