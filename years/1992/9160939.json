 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to develop secondary ion mass spectrometry              (SIMS) based imaging isotope ratio techniques for isotopic                      microanalysis of mineral deposits.  This capability will be                     combined with SIMS based trace element microanalysis.  The                      petrogenesis of ore deposits often involves an aqueous solution by              which the ore-bearing components are transported.  These                        hydrothermal solutions also transport sulfur.  Different aqueous                processes give rise to different 34S/32S isotope fractionations.                The 34S/32S ratios can provide important indications of the sulfur              origin, and by extension, the origin of economically important                  metals.  Isotope ratio and trace element imaging show the                       interrelationships of different mineral generations.  These                     generations often coexist within a single mineral grain.  The PIs               have demonstrated that imaging SIMS can successfully identify the               location of trace gold levels (\"invisible\" gold) in pyrite rims,                and that isotope ratio imaging of meteoritic materials highly                   enriched in deuterium is possible.  However, extension to 34S/32S               isotope ratio imaging requires further innovation and many careful              measurements.  In Phase II, these imaging techniques will be                    extended to microanalytical age dating and microanalytical trace                element petrogenesis.",
