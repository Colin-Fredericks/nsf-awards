The program combines challenging academic work with extensive field             experiences and stimulating physical challenges.  Participants                  apply scientific principles to real-life environmental problems                 while exploring the unique and diverse habitats of Central Florida              and the Great Smoky Mountains.  Academic work focuses on                        environmental science but includes related topics from resource                 management, conservation biology, and research methodology.  Field              experiences will emphasize the development of the knowledge, skills             and techniques needed to prepare ecosystem profiles of natural                  communities.  In follow-up activities participants will prepare                 ecosystem profiles of natural communities near their home or                    school, make comparisons with communities studied during the                    summer, and prepare and present a report of their findings in their             own schools.",
