 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                  will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                      Chicago renovate the beamline X19C at the National Synchrotron                  Light Source, which will be used in research investigations in                  the following areas of chemistry:  1)  determination of the                     structure of surfaces of complex fluids composed of polymers,                   lipids, lyotropic and thermotropic liquid crystals, 2)  the                     structure of the liquid metal-vapor and liquid metal-liquid                     dielectric interfaces, and 3)  the structure of monolayers of                   amphiphiles at the liquid-vapor and liquid-liquid interface.                                                                                                    Surface sensitive x-ray scattering techniques are used to study                 phenomena occuring at liquid interfaces.  These techniques                      require that the x-ray source have high brilliance, i.e.,                       typically a synchrotron source must be used.  A high-brillance                  source is needed because the number of scattering molecules at                  the interface is very small, the intrinsic scattering power of                  the organic compound of interest is very low, and the beam size                 required for grazing incidence Bragg diffraction is very small.                 The areas of potential technological application of the                         techniques which will be enabled by the instrumentation which                   will be provided are polymer surfaces and interfaces for                        improved lubrication and adhesion, cohesion of composite                        materials, synthetic thin films, coatings, and electrodes.",
