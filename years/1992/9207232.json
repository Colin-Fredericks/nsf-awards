 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a twelve month long-term visit by                       Professor George D. Stanley, Department of Geology, University of               Montana to Japan for a cooperative research project with                        Professor Minoru Tamura, Faculty of Education, Kumamoto                         University.  The research will include a comparative study of                   triassic reefs and reef organisms between North America and                     Japan.  The project will investigate fossiliferous outcrops of                  reeflike Triassic limestone on the Japanese islands of Kyushu and               Honshu.  It will also involve a detailed taxonomic and                          paleoecologic study of corals, sponges and other reef-building                  biotas as well as a microfacies analysis of the enclosing                       carbonate rocks.  Study of the Japanese fossils and rock types                  will form the basis for a comparison with similar-age deposits                  and fossils in the European Alps and in western North America.                                                                                                  Results of the research will be integrated with previous research               to produce a synthesis of reef-building and the distribution of                 the reef organisms during the early Mesozoic.  This project will                constitute an important step in an ongoing attempt toward a                     global synthesis of early Mesozoic reef biotas in the Tethyan and               circum-Pacific regions.  Professor Tamura is an established                     researcher with long-time interests and publications on Triassic                fossils from southern Japan.  Kumamoto University contains many                 fossils of interest.  In addition, the best curated collections                 of Triassic corals reside in Kyushu University at nearby Fukuoka.               Professor Stanley is one of the leading world authorities on                    Triassic reefs and their constituent faunas.  It is believed that               this will be a very productive collaboration and that their                     research efforts will continue after the formal agreement has                   terminated.",
