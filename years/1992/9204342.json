 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will explore the development of foraging behavior in                 golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia rosalia).  These                   small monkeys are unusual among primates in that they live in                   tight-knit family groups and all group members assist in infant                 care.  Young may learn information concerning what to eat and                   where to search for food by sharing the foraging sites of parents               and other group members.  In addition, dietary information may be               obtained when food is directly transferred from older individuals               to immatures.                                                                                                                                                   Using behavioral observation to be gathered at both the National                Zoological Park (Washington, DC) and in Brazil, the researchers                 will investigate the degree to which young tamarins take                        advantage of opportunities to learn about diet and foraging from                others.  The relative importance of various kin and non-kin as                  role models and age-changes in food sharing will be investigated.               A series of hypotheses regarding the social benefits of food                    sharing will be tested.                                                                                                                                         Food sharing among tamarins is more frequent and more complex                   than in any other primate aside from humans.  The data gathered                 will allow for the comparison of these behaviors in the two                     species.  Additionally, as the golden lion tamarin is a severely                endangered species, the data may well assist in the conservation                of the species.",
