 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Systematic in-depth investigation of high temperature                         superconducting and related materials is proposed.  Based on their              established expertise in the discovery, synthesis, and                          characterization of materials, they plan to focus their research                efforts on three highly related areas:  (1) high temperature                    superconductivity under high pressures, (2) the magnetic properties             of the superconducting state, and (3) the evolution of high                     temperature superconductivity.  By examining the electrical,                    magnetic, structural and optical properties of existing high                    temperature superconducting materials under pressures in high                   fields; by inducing superconductivity in non-superconducting but                related compounds under ultra-high pressures; and by synthesizing               compounds using special techniques developed by us, invaluable                  information will be obtained about the occurrence of high                       temperature superconductivity, the physics of magnetic flux                     dynamics and the prospect of discovering new high temperature                   superconductors.  The study will eventually lead to the development             of high temperature superconductivity with a broadened material                 base and better quality for scientific study and with higher                    transition temperatures, greater critical current density, smaller              anisotropy, greater mechanical strength, higher chemical stability,             and improved ductility for practical applications.",
