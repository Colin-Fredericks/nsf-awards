 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on the functional and structural               organization of envelope membranes of established strains of                    Escherichia coli and of new constructs.  Biochemical, immunological             and molecular-biological techniques will be used in combination                 with new developments in cryofixation procedures to optimize high               resolution topography of the membranes of Gram-negative bacterial               cells.  Emphasis is placed on a biochemical, structural and genetic             dissection of translocation processes involving membrane proteins               and polysaccharides as they are transported from the inner membrane             (IM) to their target site at the outer envelope membrane (OM).                  Two models of translocation pathways will be tested:  after                     synthesis and passage through the IM, a molecule may travel either              via IM/OM connections (the membrane adhesions sites), or via the                periplasmic space.  The proposed experiments are aimed at the study             of topographic relationships of the envelope components in                      undisrupted cells, and at a molecular stabilization of the cell                 envelope.  The work will be subdivided into two aspects:  1, the                topology of export pathways of outer membrane polysaccharides and               proteins; and 2, stabilization of the membrane organization using               cryofixation and UV-flash crosslinking, to determine the in vivo                structure of adhesion sites and periplasm.  It is hoped that                    development of the UV-flash and cryo preparation methodologies will             permit future investigations into the spatial distribution of                   components of the protein export machinery (e.g., localization of               Sec A, Sec E, and export sites of precursor proteins in wild type               and mutant cells).                                                              %%%                                                                             Gram-negative bacteria are bounded by envelopes consisting of an                inner membrane (equivalent to the plasma membrane of the bacterial              cell) and an outer membrane (a true biological membrane, with                   proteins associated with a lipid bilayer), and a layer of wall                  (peptidoglycan) sandwiched between the two membranes.  The envelope             forms a barrier against macromolecules, drugs, and viruses, and                 provides mechanical stability toward turgor pressure and physical               injury.  The envelope membranes also have to provide for the                    specific transmembrane transfer of large molecules (both coming in              and going out).  It also must be dynamic in structure, to allow for             insertion of new membrane constituents during cell growth.  The                 goal of this work is to elucidate the structural and functional                 organization of the Gram-negative bacterial surface.  It is                     expected that some of the methodological advances will have broader             applications in cell and membrane biology.  This research will                  contribute significantly to the understanding of the dynamic                    organization of the bacterial envelope membranes, their export                  machinery, and their structural and functional mosaic.",
