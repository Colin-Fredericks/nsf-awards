 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to develop scheduling                          algorithms for electric generation that account directly                        for system security requirements.  Virtually all                                algorithms in use currently do not optimize generating                          unit commitment decisions against security                                      requirements from the outset and yield, therefore,                              suboptimal results when the commitment decisions                                must be adjusted to comply with these requirements.                             Utilities can obtain significantly better results if they                       use optimal scheduling algorithms that comply directly                          with security requirements.  While algorithms of this                           type had severe computational requirements, five-to-ten                         years ago, recent advances in network programming                               have now made these algorithms more attractive.                                 The PI proposes to demonstrate the practical feasibility                        of a new algorithm for solving the security-constrained                         unit scheduling problem.  The innovation of our                                 approach is to capture the system security requirements                         within a network flow subproblem that is solved in                              conjunction with the unit commitment problem.  In                               Phase One of this effort we will develop a prototype                            implementation of this method by integrating a                                  state-of-the-art network flow algorithm into an                                 advanced unit commitment algorithm.  We will                                    demonstrate the cost savings possible with this                                 algorithm on realistic test cases using representative                          utility data.",
