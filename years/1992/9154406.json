 "awd_abstract_narration": "The K-12 mathematics and science \"frameworks\" now emphasize                     problem solving skills and conceptual understanding.  This                      has stimulated the development of performance tests because                     they are better measures of these skills than the multiple                      choice items relied upon in the past to assess student                          achievement.  However, information about performance                            measures is sparse and fragmented.                                                                                                                              The proposed project will examine the cost, technical                           quality feasibility, and acceptability of alternative                           assessment systems (i.e., testing programs that include                         combinations of measures for making decisions about                             individuals, instructional programs, or state and national                      trends).  The project will gather and analyze data on the                       performance and other types of measures used by the                             California Assessment Project and other such programs.  The                     study will examine the statistical properties of these                          measures, the resources required to develop and use them,                       and the attitudes of students, teachers, and others to their                    inclusion in testing programs.  The study also will develop                     several tasks from the same \"shell.\"  Data on these measures                    will be used to investigate the sensitivity of these tasks                      to the effects of instruction and practice.  The project's                      final report will discuss the key features and implications                     of alternative assessment systems.",
