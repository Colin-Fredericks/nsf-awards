 "awd_abstract_narration": "The strategic goal of this research is to contribute to the  development of a comprehensive theory of computational  complexity.  Computational complexity is the study of the  quantitative laws that govern computation and it is an  essential part of the science base needed to guide, harness  and exploit the explosively growing computer technology.  The proposed research has two main goals:  a) to understand  better what makes problems hard to compute and to develop  techniques to verify the degree of hardness, b) to explore  what is the best that can be done with computational resources  not sufficient to solve a problem.  Computational complexity classifies problems by the amounts of  various computational resources needed to solve them.  This  classification yields complexity classes that consist of all  problems that can be solved within a given computational  resource bound.  To gain a deeper understanding of what makes  problems hard to compute, the project explores various   complexity classes, relations between these classes  and the internal structure of these classes.  It also  explores the trade-offs between different computational  resources in problem solving, with particular attention to  sequential-time, parallel-time, nondeterministic-time, memory  requirements, randomness as a computational resource and  interactive computing.",
