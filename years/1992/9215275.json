 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will provide for research data management (RDM)                   training to Chinese Ecological Research Network (CERN) scientists               responsible for design of a system of RDM within CERN, and serve                as a proof-of-concept prototype for collaborations that could be                achieved with similar international organizations, particularly                 developing countries, beginning to address RDM needs of long-term               ecological research (LTER).  IT will also serve to meet an                      immediate and documented need within the Chinese ecological                     community.                                                                                                                                                      The 12-week training will address basic concepts of managing LTER               data across both the US-NSF LTER and CERN networks and will                     include lectures, demonstrations, discussion and hands-on                       computer experience. LTER RDM personnel will team-teach modules                 focused on the needs of CERN.  The training will cover a range of               RDM issues from principles of design and organization to                        implementation.  Discussions will focus on the needs for                        international collaboration and sharing of long-term data sets                  and establishment of international data management objectives.                  This will establish groundwork for protocols and standards to                   facilitate international data exchange and set the stage for                    future CERN-LTER cooperative efforts.  The resulting curriculum                 will be used to develop other courses - tailoring each, as this                 one will be to fit particular needs of emerging international                   LTER programs.",
