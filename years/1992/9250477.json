 "awd_abstract_narration": "A cluster of 486/33 IBM-compatible PCs ia being used to assist                  Rose-Hulman physics and applied optics (PH/AO) faculty in                       building computational physics into all areas of the                            curriculum.Every Rose-Hulman freshman is now exposed to the                     Mathematica symbolic mathematics package for a full year.  The                  cluster of PCs enables PH/AO faculty to first get familiar with                 Mathematica, and then develop regular Mathematica assignments                   at all course levels in the undergraduate curriculum, to                        reinforce and build up students' skills.  These often use the                   notebook feature, so students can modify a template or shell.In                 upper level PH/AO courses, a different set of simulations and                   assignments are based on materials in the CUPS (Comprehensive                   Undergraduate Physics Software) project (available in beta                      version, starting in September, 1992).  This requires much less                 effort from faculty, because written CUPS resource materials                    always suggest a number of ways in which students can explore                   the physics by modifying existing source programs.  CUPS                        simulations across the upper-level physics courses should                       generate a lot of interest in both students and faculty.  The                   cluster provides an accessible high-speed computing resource to                 run and use CUPS.In addition, the machines support extensive                    chaos simulations, and experimental data acquisition for a                      course being offered on chaos in physical systems.An                            extracurricular software activity for PH/AO majors will be                      initiated, using the cluster as the main resource.  This will                   work in parallel with other departmental efforts to generate                    software demonstrations to enhance classroom teaching.  It                      should also increase student interest in physics or applied                     optics as a major.",
