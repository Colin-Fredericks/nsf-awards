 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed investigation is to introduce a new               approach to the study of the micromechanical behavior of concrete               by combining its materials science and structural engineering                   aspects, based on the assessment of the qualitative and                         quantitative significance and role of cement paste-sand particle                interfaces in stress-strain behavior of concrete that is                        subjected to pure uniaxial compressive force. In the                            experimental part, mortar cylinders having sand particles of                    different packing characteristics are tested for their stress-                  strain behavior and their micromechanical properties.  Concrete                 cylinders will also be tested to compare the significance of the                coarse aggregate with the sand particles.  These are then                       correlated with the microstructural properties using SEM with                   backscatter electron analysis and image analysis capabilities,                  mercury intrusion porosimetry, and electrical conductivity                      measurement techniques. In the analytical part, a model is                      developed which describes the micromechanical behavior of                       concrete and defines quantitatively the role and significance of                interfacial parameters. In the model development a nonlinear                    fracture mechanics approach is taken using the finite element                   method as a tool to analyze crack propagation and localized                     deformation.  The relationship between crack propagation and sand               particles packing characteristics will be studied.  In this                     approach, interfaces are treated as weak planes or initial flaws.               Results of this investigation can be extended to other cases                    including durability, creep, and shrinkage considerations, and                  optimum mixture proportioning of conventional and advanced                      cement-based concrete composites.",
