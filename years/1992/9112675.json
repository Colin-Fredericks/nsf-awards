 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the domain of ecological studies of species                       interactions, those involving insects and birds are relatively                  more common while those dealing with volant mammals, bats, are                  relatively less frequently encountered.  But there are 250                      species of bats that pollinate and disperse the seeds of more                   than 130 plant genera, many of which are of substantial economic                significance.  Such studies have centered on individual bat                     species and a limited number of plant species rather than on a                  guild or community of bat species or a suite of plant species.                  Attention has been focused almost exclusively on the Neotropics,                with very little study devoted to fruit bats of the Old World                   tropics; these two groups have undergone independent evolution                  toward frugivorous and nectarivorous feeding modes, and thus may                differ significantly in their ecologies.                                               A two year field study of fruit bat ecology in northeast                 India (the Tista valley in Sikkim), focusing on community level                 interactions and effects on plant reproductive success via                      pollination and seed dispersal, and the roles of other                          pollinators and dispersers (birds, moths, ants), will be                        undertaken.  Differences between phytophagous bats of the Old                   World and New World, in terms of dispersal abilities and                        nutritional needs, will be investigated.  A study of the                        potentially highly-coevolved relationship between the bat                       Eonycteris spelaea, as pollinator of a plant (Oroxylum), is                     planned.  The conservation implications of these interactions                   will be studied, as will the role of these fruit bats as pests of               commercial fruit production.",
