 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the data translation arena, there is considerable speculation                about the relative merits of the pairwise model of data                         translation versus the intermediate-form model.  If translation                 is desired between some number of specific encoding schemes, the                pairwise model of translation requires that translators be                      written between every combination of the encoding schemes, taken                two at a time.  The intermediate-form model requires that a new,                generic encoding scheme be used as an intermediate vehicle.                     Then, for each encoding scheme, two translators need to be                      written, one to and one from the intermediate encoding                          scheme.  These can then be composed to form a translation bridge                between any two specific encoding schemes.  This project proposes               two experiments to evaluate these models of data translation.                   The first experiment is designed to compare the quality of the                  translators in each case.  The second experiment is designed to                 compare the effort required to generate the translators in each                 case.  The ultimate goal of the work is to provide general,                     definitive guidelines for choosing a model of data translation.                 These guidelines will allow the myriad practitioners who do data                translation to optimize their efforts by choosing the model that                best supports their individual translation environment.",
