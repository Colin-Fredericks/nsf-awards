 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dicotyledonous angiosperm family Cactaceae (the Cactus                 Family) will be examined for systematically-useful variation in the             chloroplast genome.  DNA samples of representative taxa from                    throughout the family will be analyzed for gene sequence variation              in the chloroplast-encoded gene for ribulose bisphosphate                       carboxylase large subunit (rbcL).  Studies of gene sequence                     variation will be used to address long-standing questions about the             phylogenetic relationships within the family at the subfamilial and             tribal levels, as well as to assess monophyly of previously                     proposed taxonomic groups.  Data derived from rbcL gene sequencing              will be integrated with morphological data obtained from                        comparative studies of structural characters such as those of                   spines, flowers, fruits, and seeds, and will be analyzed to develop             hypotheses about the relationships within and between subfamilies               of the Cactaceae, and within the tribes of the subfamilies                      Cactoideae and Opuntioideae.  Cladistic analysis of DNA data                    together with morphological data will provide additional                        information from which inferences may be made to assist in                      understanding the complex phylogeny, morphological diversification,             and biogeographic radiation of the cacti.",
