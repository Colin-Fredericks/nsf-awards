 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the design and synthesis of                       nanosized units termed modules that can be pieced together by                   directed organization using specific, non-covalent bond                         associations.  The modules contain functionality for directed                   organization and the rigid geometry needed to form covalently                   pre-assembled sections of the desired cavities and/or channels.                 Specific 1D, 2D and 3D target motifs can be realized by                         placement of appropriate functional groups on the modules.  The                 approach could have a major impact on the synthesis of new                      functional organic materials.                                                                                                                                   With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                    the research of Dr. Jeffrey S. Moore, a young investigator from                 the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan, Ann                  Arbor.  Professor Moore will focus his efforts on the rationale                 design and preparation of packed organic crystals possessing                    large internal cavities and/or channels.  The resulting                         crystals will serve as a new family of \"hosts\" in the                           developing area of host-guest chemistry.  The method, in the                    long run, could lead to the preparation of new organic                          materials and even tailor-made organic zeolites.",
