 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide for the dissemination of the results                  of projects supported by the Instrumentation and Laboratory                     Improvement Program.  This year will note the seventh year that                 the Division for  Experimentation and Laboratory-Oriented                       Studies (DELOS) of ASEE and the National Science Foundation                     have cooperated in holding sessions at which grantees from the                  Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program have                         presented their results.  The participation of the grantees in                  the poster session has grown each year by on the order of fifty                 percent, and the expected number this June will be greater than                 sixty.  There is also an associated technical presentation                      session, which typically has four grantee papers and a short                    presentation by an NSF Program Director on the ILI program.                     The amount of work that the three principals have been                          performing has grown commensurately through the years, and this                 proposal was solicited to support their effort on behalf of the                 Engineering education community and the NSF ILI program.                        Typically, there will be about 2000 faculty attending the                       Annual ASEE Conference.  The presentation is becoming a                         fundamental component for the dissemination of the results of                   the ILI program for the Engineering education community.  This                  award allows the three principals to continue their effort, and                 supports the anticipated increase in the amount of grantee                      participation in the future.  With the requested support,                       continued increase in faculty interest in undergraduate                         engineering laboratory development is expected.",
