 "awd_abstract_narration": "Before his 33rd birthday, Simon Kuznets introduced the logistic                 and Gompertz curves to economic analysis, defined the key issues                in the study of economic growth, and laid the basis for the now                 standard seasonal adjustments for prices, employment, and output.               His next 15 years were devoted to the development of national                   income accounts and their application to practical problems of                  government.  As chief statistician of the War Production Board,                 he demonstrated the superiority of the national income approach                 in establishing wartime and civilian production targets.  During                the balance on his career, Kuznets concentrated on developing an                empirically based theory of modern economic growth, for which he                was awarded the Nobel Prize.  Professor Robert Fogel and Dean                   Enid Fogel are investigating the work of Simon S. Kuznets with                  the objective not only of assessing his contributions to                        economics, but also of showing how Kuznets' work helped to                      transform economics during the twentieth century from a branch of               moral philosophy to a discipline that provides an important share               of the individuals who make and implement economic policy in the                government and in business.  They are examining both Kuznets'                   substantive contribution to economic knowledge and his scientific               methods.  These methods, as much as the substantive work, are a                 major factor in the transformation of economics, yet they are now               known only to a relatively limited circle of empirical                          investigators.",
