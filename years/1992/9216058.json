This is a venerable international                                    conference, dating its inception to the early 1950's,                           which provides a forum for discussion of advances                               in the rapidly advancing field of high-speed imaging                            technologies.  The advent of ultrashort pulse lasers,                           of picosecond and now femtosecond time duration,                                and concomitant advances in time-resolved methods                               of detection has kept this a vibrant field of study,                            with strong input both from industry, government                                laboratories, and academia.  The International                                  Advisory Committee of this Congress has expressed                               concern of the limited number of young scientists                               and engineers, particularly at the graduate student                             and post-doctoral level, who have the financial                                 resources to attend the International Congress.  To                             address this problem, they have approached the                                  NSF to provide resources for travel support, with                               the intent of using this as leverage to raise                                   matching funds from industry groups active in the                               field.  This is an opportunity to help raise the                                visibility in industry of the need to strengthen the                            academic infrastructure and provide for young                                   researchers in this important technology field.",
