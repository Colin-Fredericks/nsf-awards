 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kumar will continue his work on equivariant cohomology with                generalized coefficients.  He will study a new G-equivariant                    cohomology theory of a G-space, where G is a real Lie group.                    This new cohomology theory is defined as the cohomology of the                  complex which is obtained from the polynomial functions on the                  Lie algebras of G by generalized functions on the Lie algebra.                  This cohomology is encountered in studying the index theory of                  transversally elliptic operators on G-manifolds.                                     The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                   twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                 exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                             representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                   upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                    theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                        mechanics and elementary particle physics.",
