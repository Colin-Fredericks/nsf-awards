 "awd_abstract_narration": "Before high-performance MIMD architectures become commonplace in                production scientific, engineering, and business applications,                  three programming problems that plague current systems must be                  solved.  First, writing parallel programs by hand is very                       difficult.  The programmer must manage communication,                           synchronization, and scheduling of tens to thousands of                         independent processes.  The burden of correctly managing the                    environment often overwhelms programmers.  Second, once                         implemented on a particular MIMD architecture, the resulting                    codes are usually not usable on other MIMD architectures,                       necessitating a substantial effort to port.  This discourages                   users from parallelizing their code, since new architectures are                introduced so frequently.  Third, there is no software support                  for transparently executing applications on heterogeneous \"meta-                systems\" comprised of a variety of high-performance                             architectures.                                                                                                                                                  This proposal addresses all three of these problems.  We have                   attacked the first two with Mentat, an easy-to-use, object-                     oriented, parallel processing system developed at the University                of Virginia.  We plan to test the efficacy of the Mentat approach               on a set of real applications on a variety of platforms.  The                   objective is to determine whether Mentat is easy to use on real                 applications and to measure performance.  Our approach to the                   third problem is evolutionary.  We will extend Mentat into a                    heterogeneous environment, and use the extended Mentat as a test-               bed for meta-systems experimentation.  Based on experimental                    results, a prototype meta-system that provides an easy-to-use,                  high performance abstraction for users will be constructed.",
