 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues continue their study and               development of highly accurate finite element methods for                       computing solutions of partial differential equations.  They have               shown in previous work that high degree methods, such as the h-p                version of the finite element method, are very effective.                       Recently these methods have been implemented in various                         engineering programs (inclusive of commercial).  The research                   will concentrate on mathematical and numerical problems leading                 to the reliable solution of problems of solid mechanics with                    important applications in engineering, such as fractures in 3-                  dimensional bodies, modelling of plates and shells, etc.                             The goal of the research is to establish mathematical                      results that will be used in the computer analysis of engineering               problems.  These results will allow to be developed highly                      effective computational methods for broad applications in                       research and commercial computer codes that are widely used in                  engineering science and practice.",
