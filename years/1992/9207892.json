 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although size and stage-structured populations are                         ubiquitous in natural communities few studies have examined their               ecological consequences.  Bluegill, the most common fish species                in many small lakes throughout North America, have populations                  that are functionally stage-structured, with juveniles feeding on               soft-bodied littoral invertebrates and adults feeding on limnetic               zooplankton.  The proposed research will test the hypothesis that               bluegill populations link dynamics of littoral and limnetic                     habitats via their stage-structured habitat use and thus provide                a central focus about which the rest of the fish community is                   organized.  The research will examine processes responsible for                 among-lake variation in the production of large Daphnia, the                    primary resource of adult bluegill and the factor that explains                 among-lake variation in bluegill density and growth. Competition                between juvenile bluegill and a suite of littoral fish species,                 including largemouth bass, will be examined using a combination                 of comparative lake surveys and experimental tests.  The research               will provide general understanding of the mechanisms and                        consequences of stage-structured interactions, and can help guide               the development of specific management strategies for warm-water                fisheries.",
