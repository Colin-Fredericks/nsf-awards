 "awd_abstract_narration": "Model systems are used to understand how the nervous system                     controls behavior.  In this award, Dr. Roye will investigate the                sensory and motor integration of a withdrawal behavior in an                    invertebrate.  Identification of the motor nerve cells, the sensory             nerve cells and the interneurons which interconnect the motor and               sensory cells will lead to a greater understanding of the                       functional aspects of this behavior.  Much of the research will be              performed by undergraduates, who will make significant                          contributions to all aspects of the project and gain valuable                   experience in scientific research.  The results obtained from this              work on the form and function of the neural networks responsible                for withdrawal behavior in an invertebrate model system will                    provide insight into the organization of neural networks that                   produce the more complex behaviors seen in organisms at higher                  levels of the phylogenetic scale.",
