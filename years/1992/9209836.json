 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work in parallel processing for Computational Field Simulation                  (CFS) problems has highlighted the need for techniques to                       support efficient mapping of large dataspace problems between                   memory hierarchies in an efficient manner so that data is                       available to the processors when they are ready to use it.                      Typical memory hierarchies to date have good support for                        programs with small working-set sizes and good locality of                      reference.  Problems in the CFS domain typically deal with                      huge data-sets and solution techniques which make passes over                   the entire data-set have very poor locality of reference.  The                  focus of this research is an investigation into software                        techniques for allowing applications programmers to describe                    the data access patterns for their application to allow a                       hardware system to be built to efficiently manage the data                      movement between the different levels of a memory hierarchy to                  provide data to the processor at peak speed.  This work will                    involve the simulation of this system so that its effective                     performance enhancements can be analyzed to determine the                       feasibility of such an approach.",
