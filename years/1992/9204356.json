 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, the Field Museum of                   Natural History will rennovate and equip space to serve as a                    study area for its extensive primate specimen collection. A large               formica work counter will be constructed and overhead fluorescent               lights installed. Electrical outlets will be situated along the                 counter to permit convenient and multipe access for lights,                     computers and other electric-powered equipment. Shutters will be                removed from windows near the counter to permit reseachers to                   utilize natural light to study materials. Finally the floor will                be painted and sealed.                                                                                                                                          The Field Museum in Chicago houses one of the finest collections                of primate specimens in the world. The total of ca. 4,500                       individuals includes all families, most genera and a majority of                species and subspecies of primates worldwide. The taxonomic and                 geographic composition of the collection is excellent and the                   majority of the individuals were taken from the wild at a time                  when it was legally and ethically possible to do so. These                      specimens document natural distributions and habitat associations               of species and reveal the morphological effects of natural foods,               movement patterns and social conditions. It would be impossible                 to duplicate the materials today. While the museum has undertaken               major work in restoring the materials to make them more                         accessible to reseachers, lack of a proper study area still                     hampers access. This grant will remedy that situation.                                                                                                          This project is important because it will make a significant                    national scientific resource more readily accessible to a large                 number of interested reseachers.",
