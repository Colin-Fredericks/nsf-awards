 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many ecological costs and benefits thought to result from group                 living are a direct result of cooperative interactions among                    individual group members.  Underlying these cooperative                         interactions are the concepts of kin selection and reciprocity,                 analysis of which is dependent upon understanding the genetic                   relatedness of the involved (and non-involved) individuals.  Yet                traditional difficulties in determining the relatedness of specific             individuals in a group have hampered our understanding of if and                how postulated ecological benefits are gained by all group members.             This study proposes to examine ecological and genetic factors                   influencing the social system of the coati (Nasua narica), a                    Neotropical procyonid whose social structure of female-bonded                   groups and solitary males is unique within the Carnivora.                       Combining field observations of an extensively known population                 with genetic fingerprinting techniques will allow examination of                three potential ecological explanations (predation, foraging, and               parasite pressures) for the evolution and maintenance of the coati              sociality-asociality dichotomy.  Quantifying the importance of                  genetic relatedness to variation in cooperative interactions among              individuals will provide a better understanding of underlying                   relationships and constraints and how ecological costs or benefits              vary with the relatedness of individuals.  The study can provide                important clues to the stability and instability of mammalian                   societies.",
