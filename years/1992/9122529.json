Pillared clays are a new class of                           catalytic material chemically similar to, but morphologically                   very different from, zeolites.  Zeolites have been the subject                  of extensive experimental and theoretical studies while                         studies on the pillared clays are primarily experimental.                       Compared to zeolites, pillared-clays have the advantage of                      having more structural flexibility, that is, by changing the                    height, size and distribution of the pillars the structure of                   the pillared-clay can be optimized for particular reaction                      and/or separation applications.  As a result, in order to                       fully exploit this structural flexibility, it is important to                   understand the fundamental thermodynamic and transport                          properties and their dependence on the physicochemical                          characteristics of the pillared-clays, as well as those of the                  molecular species diffusing through the porous medium.                                                                                                          This work will systematically examine the following:                                                                                                            1.     Diffusion of 3-Dimensional molecules through pillared-                   clay of       various size, height and distribution of pillars.                                                                                                 2.     Diffusion with reversible and irreversible adsorption at                 low    and high flow rates (or densities).                                                                                                                      3.     The variation of diffusion and sorption with inter-                      molecular            and surface forces and with the shape, size and            flexibility          of the diffusing molecules.                                                                                                                4.     Comparison of Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics results                 to     establish the relationship between MC simulation time and                MD     time, if any.                                                                                                                                            5.     Studies of multicomponent diffusion in porous media and                  the    evaluation of mutual diffusivities.",
