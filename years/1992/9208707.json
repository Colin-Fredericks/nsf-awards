 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Kathleen Deagan                   acquire for the Florida Museum of Natural History and curate                    approximately 800,000 to 1,000,000 objects excavated from the                   site of St. Augustine, Florida. These materials are currently                   held by the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board.  A severe                and destructive flood in 1990 in the Board's basement artifact                  repository along with the loss in 1991 of its only archaeological               collections manager position have made it impossible for the                    Board to continue to adequately care for this artifact                          collection. The materials are packed in closed cardboard boxes,                 stored in a variety of rooms, hallways and closets and are                      totally inaccessible to researchers. Dr. Deagan and colleagues                  will transfer these materials to the Florida Museum of Natural                  History at the University of Florida where a second large                       collection of materials from the site is currently housed. They                 will inventory, accession and computer catalogue the new                        materials and rehouse them in inert specimen boxes and closed                   cabinets. The associated records will be organized and duplicated               and a survey conducted of immediate conservation needs. In this                 way the collection will be made available for scientific                        research. (NSF support provides funds for both transport and                    curation. No purchase fee is involved.)                                                                                                                         St. Augustine, the oldest city in the United States, was first                  occupied ca. 1566. It has been the focus of intensive                           archaeological study and excavations have been conducted at 28                  domestic, religious, military and commercial sites. The ca.                     1,500,000 objects recovered include ceramic, metal, shell, bone,                glass and stone artifacts as well as soil, floral, charcoal,                    malacological and other environmental samples. Together they                    permit anthropologists to ask a wide range of questions not only                about human behavior but also about environmental interaction and               change. The materials are also relevant for studies of historical               ecology, cultural evolution, social history, materials sciences                 and post-1500 technology. They provide one of the primary                       foundations for our understanding of Euro-American adaptation,                  acculturation, the demise of Native American society and the                    emergence of Euro-American culture.                                                                                                                             While the Florida State Museum materials have been widely used,                 the Preservation Board collection is inaccessible for scientific                study. Dr. Deagan's project is important because it will curate                 this valuable body of data and make it available for study.",
