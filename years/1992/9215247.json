 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of surface diffusion is the focus of this research                  project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                       Program.  In this work Professor George, who has pioneered the                  application of laser induced thermal desorption methods for the                 study of surface diffusion, will extend his studies to                          anisotropic and coverage dependent diffusion using a newly                      developed linear diffraction technique.  This laser induced                     transient grating method promises to provide wider                              applicability, and the possibility of monitoring diffusion over                 a much wider coverage range than previously possible.  These                    methods will be applied to the study of small molecule                          diffusion on bimetallic surfaces, long chain hydrocarbon                        diffusion on ruthenium, and to the study of molecular diffusion                 on ice surfaces.                                                                %%%                                                                             An understanding of the mechanism and rates of surface                          diffusion of molecules is essential to the understanding of the                 dynamics of reactions on surfaces.  Newly developed transient                   grating methods will be applied to the study of a range of                      molecular adsorbates on well characterized surfaces, providing                  much needed information for the understanding of catalytically                  relevant surface reactions.",
