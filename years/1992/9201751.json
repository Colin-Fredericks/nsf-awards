The                long-term goal of this research is the recovery of accurate                     camera motion and dense three-dimensional shape information from                television images at video rate.  In prior work, the Principal                  Investigator developed a matrix-based factorization method for                  this task, based on a set of feature points tracked from frame to               frame of a dense image sequence.  Experiments with the method                   demonstrated a dramatic performance improvement over existing                   shape and motion recovery systems.  This research will now                      develop a characterization of the noise sensitivity of image                    sequence analysis, explore efficient and incremental numerical                  methods for factorization, and reformulate the method for                       perspective projection, multiple motions, and dense shape                       results.  As an exploratory advance into a new area of research                 an investigation of the link between motion analysis and multi-                 frame of object recognition will also be conducted.  This                       research should contribute to a better theoretical understanding                of visual motion analysis, and produce a vision module that would               let a robot localize itself in the environment, draw a map of its               own surroundings for navigation and obstacle avoidance, and                     perceive the shape of objects in order to recognize or manipulate               them.",
