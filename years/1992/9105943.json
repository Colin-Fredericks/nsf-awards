 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal deals with the synthesis of 3-deoxyanthocyanidin                  phytoalexins in sorghum.  It involves characterization of an enzyme             suspected to be involved in deoxyanthocyanidin synthesis,                       determination of the timing of initiation of the synthetic pathway              by analysis of pathway intermediates by 14C labeling, the appearance            of mRNA specific to genes regulating phenylpropanoid and flavonoid              synthesis, and comparison of juvenile and mature stages of plants               to determine differences in their ability to express resistance.                The phytoalexins are synthesized in a site specific manner within               vesicle-like inclusions in cells that are under fungal attack.  The             deoxyanthocyanidins are both fungitoxic and phytotoxic and they                 accumulate specifically within the immediate area of the infection              site at an exceptionally early time in the disease interaction.                 Three hours prior to the onset of accumulation there is a marked                increase in the level of extractable chalcone synthase enzyme                   activity in the host tissue.  As these compounds are phytotoxic                 they are themselves toxic to the cells that produce them.  It is                hypothesized that the synthesis of the phytoalexins occurs in a                 compartmentalized fashion that protects the host tissue from their              toxic effects and in a manner that allows for their directed                    synthesis and release at the site of fungal perturbation.  These                studies will help to elucidate natural mechanisms of plant                      resistance to pests with important implications for agricultural                applications.//",
