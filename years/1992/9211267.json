The basis of the proposed                            investigation is the observation that the photostationary state                 for certain diacidobisbipyridylruthenium(II) complexes switched                 from Ru(II) to Ru(III) over a remarkably small temperature                      interval when irradiated in chloroform solution.  There was                     also evidence for a photooscillation between the two oxidation                  states under certain conditions.  Elucidation of the mechanism                  of the photochemical behavior is a primary objective of the                     research although plans are outlined to examine other chemical                  systems that may behave in a similar fashion.                                   %%%                                                                             This research, which deals with photochemically initiated                       inorganic reactions, if successful could have very significant                  technological applications for \"smart glass\", i.e., changes                     color with temperature, various types of sensors and switches,                  and possibly for mass storage applications.",
