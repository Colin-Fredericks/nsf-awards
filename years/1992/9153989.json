 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate existing examples of                              conceptual change over a range of topics in physics in order                    to discern different types of conceptual change and to                          identify instructional strategies effective at inducing                         them.  The result will be a taxonomy of conceptual change                       which associates types of conceptual change with                                instructional strategies to facilitate the change process.                      These strategies will be developed on the basis of the                          investigators' classroom experience and a careful study of                      current work in student conceptions and conceptual change,                      as well as selected examples of conceptual change in the                        history of mechanics.  The field work will gather                               information about students' conceptions through various                         interview and diagnostic methods as well as computationally-                    based protocol analysis, including use of computational                         linguistics, term clustering and knowledge representation.                      This work will provide information for building conceptual                      representations which will explicitly depict particular                         elements and organizations of students' conceptions that are                    critical to the process of conceptual change.  The utility                      of natural language processing and other computational                          analyses in extracting information and the development of                       conceptual representations will be demonstrated.  These                         techniques will guide the construction of the conceptual                        change taxonomy.                                                                                                                                                This research will have several outcomes:  1)  a deeper                         understanding of the role conceptions in understanding                          physics and solving physics problems, demonstrating that the                    task of physics instruction is one of changing belief                           systems and not merely one of imparting facts and problem-                      solving skills, 2)  a more detailed analysis of alternative                     conceptions and the nature of conceptual change and 3)  a                       taxonomy of conceptual change associated with strategies                        which seem to induce particular types of conceptual change                      that can guide teachers in the classroom.",
