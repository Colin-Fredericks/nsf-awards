 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods have become important                   for the manufacture of technologically-significant thin films.                  Many important materials are synthesized by this general                        family of techniques, including semiconducting and insulating                   films, and diamond films for wear hardening and optical uses.                                                                                                   This project is a multidisciplinary collaborative effort                        designed to study growth mechanisms of CVD of diamond and                       related films.  Recent measurements have demonstrated that the                  morphology of CVD grown diamond films is very sensitive to                      activation and growth conditions.  In order to rationally                       control the growth process a link is necessary between the                      structure of the films produced and the chemistry that is                       taking place in the growth reactor.  To address this, three                     aspects of the CVD growth process are explored: identification                  of the gas phase species present in the boundary layer above                    the substrate, determination of the species present on the                      substrate surface and surface of the grown film, and                            structural determination of the film morphology.  Laser                         ionization and secondary ion mass spectrometries, surface                       vibrational spectroscopy, and electron and optical                              microscopies will be used for these determinations.  The                        results from these studies are expected to contribute to                        development of a fundamental understanding of how gas-phase                     and surface chemistry influence the composition, growth rate,                   and structural properties of the films produced.  This                          understanding is important for ultimate utilization of diamond                  film technology in the production of wear resistant coatings,                   high thermal conductivity semiconductors, abrasives, and                        optical coatings.",
