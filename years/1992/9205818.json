 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell surface hydrophobicity is a property of many                          microorganisms.  A group of small hydrophobic proteins has                      recently been described in filamentous fungi.  These proteins,                  termed hydrophobins, have a number of properties in common,                     including:  1) accumulation on surfaces of sporulation                          structures, 2) accumulation on aerial hyphae, 3) presence of                    eight cysteines in the molecule, 4) putative hydrophobic leader                 sequences, and 5) hydrophobic domains in the secreted protein.                  Proteins, or genes encoding such proteins, have been described                  from a number of different unrelated filamentous fungi, including               one from the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica.                   This small hydrophobic protein, cryparin, was discovered because                it is down-regulated in strains which are hypovirulent and                      sporulate poorly.  Cryparin accumulates on asexual fruiting                     bodies and in aerial hyphae.  Unlike other hydrophobins, cryparin               is also a lectin.  The evolutionary conservation in different                   fungi of similar small cell surface hydrophobic proteins                        associated with fruiting bodies suggests that they play important               roles in the biology of these fungi.  This proposal is to                       investigate the role of cryparin in the biology of the chestnut                 blight fungus.  The physical properties of cryparin at air                      interfaces may be important for some aspect of fruiting body                    formation, positioning of the fruiting body, or spore dispersal.                Cryparin could also play a role in virulence as proposed for                    another hydrophobin.  To begin addressing the role of cryparin in               the biology of the chestnut blight fungus.                                      %%%                                                                                                                                                                  The chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitics, has                  nearly eliminated the American chestnut from its original natural               range.  Before this disease killed them chestnut trees were one                 of the most important and common trees in the forests that range                from New England to the Southern Appalachians.  A biological                    control for this disease has been discovered.  A virus infects                  the chestnut blight fungus causing it to no longer be able to                   attack the chestnut tree or to form normal fungal reproductive                  structures.  We have found in previous work that the virus                      interferes with production of a few specific fungal proteins, one               of which is the protein cryparin.  We have preliminary evidence                 that this protein may play a role in the ability of the fungus to               reproduce.  There is also a possibility that the protein enhances               the ability of fungus to damage infected trees.  It is the                      purpose of the study to investigate what role this abundantly                   produced protein plays in the biology of the fungus.  Knowledge                 gained by this study may lead to the development of new                         approaches for the control of plant diseases.",
