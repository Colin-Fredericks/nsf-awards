 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an interdisciplinary laboratory for                    the education of manufacturing engineering technicians,                         robotics technicians, and drafting/design technicians in a                      realistic, collaborative environment.  The laboratory involves                  a CAD-based advanced prototype design and production system                     involving participation by students from all three disciplines.                 In this interaction, students from the different programs                       collaborate on the design, prototyping, and manufacture of                      discrete parts.  The equipment used includes a computer-                        controlled system utilizing a ultra-violet laser and photo-                     sensitive resin to produce accurate prototypes of parts from                    CAD drawings.  Additional equipment allows these prototypes to                  be measured and refined and then used to reconfigure an                         existing factory laboratory to manufacture the parts.  As a                     result of this lab, students in the three disciplines gain                      knowledge in the use of advanced prototype production equipment                 and, more importantly, in how the different disciplines must                    interact and collaborate in an industrial setting.  Thus, the                   proposed laboratory improvement upgrades the education of                       technical and engineering students in the different                             disciplines, and provides a model for how those disciplines can                 and should interact in order to prepare those students                          realistically and effectively for careers in an industrial                      environment.",
