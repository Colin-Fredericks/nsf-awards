 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides equipment to enhance the hands-on                         experimentation and data processing capabilities of the                         environmental sciences laboratory at Muskingum Area Technical                   College.  The equipment consists of six Hach spectrophotometers                 interfaced with six personal computers; six wet chemistry labs                  are being established in the same facility to complete the                      enhancement.  The additional equipment will allow for more                      experiments and data collection and analysis to be completed by                 students in seven different courses in the regular curriculum,                  and at least two of the special problems courses that are                       offered each year.  Muskingum Tech's environmental sciences                     program meets the training needs in a three county service                      district and beyond, and offers associates degrees in                           Environmental Resources Management (ERM) and Parks, Recreation,                 and Wildlife (PRW).  Hands-on training is offered in spills                     management, resource management, water and air pollution                        control, hazardous materials management, groundwater hydrology,                 and a variety of other areas.  Faculty members have designed a                  laboratory to maximize the potential use of space and of                        laboratory time to enhance the hands-on learning experience of                  students.  The result will be graduates who are better-prepared                 for immediate employment or upper-division work.",
