Over a period                  of three years the program plan to model enhancement of the                     quality of instruction in the nation's largest school district                  through (1) training in content and pedagogy, (2) ongoing peer                  and instructional support, and (3) the continuing provision of                  all materials and equipment for successful classroom                            implementation of hands-on curricula.  The major goals of the                   project are: increase teachers' knowledge of microbiology                       concepts; change teaching methodology from rote to                              interactive; to develop a New York City-wide ongoing support                    network; and to stimulate teachers' own continuing development                  of materials for activity-based learning.  Two hundred                          teachers and sixty science supervisors will serve as                            participants for this project.                                                                                                                                  Cost sharing is equivalent to 51% of the NSF award.",
