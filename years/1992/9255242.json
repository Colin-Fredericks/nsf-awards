 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michigan University seeks funds to investigate what is                          involved in trying to teach mathematics for understanding in                    an elementary classroom, and to develop tools for inquiry into                  and communication about this kind of teaching.  The project                     has three interrelated purposes:  to study the kind of                          mathematics teaching and learning envisioned by the current                     reforms; to construct new approaches for teachers and teacher                   educators to learn about this kind of teaching;  and to                         educate teacher educators in reforming the aims, content, and                   discourse of teacher education.  The proposers will develop a                   collection of scenarios/vignettes of elementary mathematics                     classrooms, and will place them into a hypermedia environment                   for investigation and use by other mathematics educators.                       These materials will contribute to understanding teacher/                       student dialogues and classroom interactions and will help                      researcher learn more about how children construct                              mathematics. The implications for teacher preparation include                   the use of materials for instruction in courses for teachers,                   both preservice and inservice.  In addition, the instructors                    of the courses for teachers will learn from the materials,                      their interpretation, and the research results.                                                                                                                 Cost sharing amounts to over 12% of NSF funding.",
