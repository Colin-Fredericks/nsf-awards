Known as SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience), this                  hands-on research will provide an advanced learning experience for              undergraduate and graduate students.                                                                                                                                   Students will participate for 4 weeks in the field segment in            the Rio Grande rift near Santa Fe, New Mexico, an area that                     provides stimulating tectonic research as well as an opportunity                to study occurrences of groundwater and hydrocarbons.  Research                 uses seismic reflection and refraction, gravity, magnetics,                     electrical resistivity, electromagnetics, and magnetotellurics.                                                                                                        SAGE students will participate in every phase of the field               research from the collection and processing of data to its                      interpretation, culminating with both an oral and written report.               Where the required supervision is available at their home                       institutions, students will continue their research on their own                campuses.  This research is augmented by a visit to a SAGE faculty              member's campus and attendance at a scientific meeting.",
