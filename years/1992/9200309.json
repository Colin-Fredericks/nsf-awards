 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American building industry has undergone dramatic changes              during the past decade.  The U.S. building industry is fragmented               which has been the barriers to advance the technology development               in the building design.  To increase the competitiveness of the                 building industry, an Industry/University Cooperative Research                  Center would provide a mechanism to accelerate the technology                   transfer to the commercial practice.  Such an effort will provide               a research base to develop the technologies needed for the                      innovations to occur in the building industry.  Carnegie Mellon                 University's Industry/University Research Center for Building                   Performance and Diagnostics is addressing these needs.                               The Center program will address components of advanced                     communications and office technologies in relation to the building              performance (acoustic, visual, thermal, spatial, and air quality)               problem.  The initial research agenda of the Center will address;               1) international building studies, 2) development of an innovative              process for building delivery, and 3) development and                           implementation of a state-of-the-art Electronic Material Technology             demonstration building.                                                              There are nine company sponsors for the Center committing                  approximately $450,000.                                                              The Principle Investigator/Center Director and his colleagues              are internationally recognized experts and have the knowledge and               facilities to run this center.                                                       This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center is being              cost shared and coordinated with Dr. John Scalzi, Program Director,             Structures & Building System Programs.                                               The Program Director recommends Carnegie Mellon University be              awarded $75,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.                  Near the end of the first year the Program Director will                   review the progress of the Center on  a number of criteria,                     including the following: 1) the extent to which the university-                 industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the                  support base is developing; 3) the extent to which a robust                     research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the             Program Director will recommend support for the next period of this             continuing award.",
