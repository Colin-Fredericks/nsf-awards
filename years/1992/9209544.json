 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines the use of statistical evidence in the trial                process.  Statistical evidence, such as DNA analyses, may give                  rise to judgment errors, and the study investigates the                         conditions under which fact-finders will be most influenced by                  this evidence.  The first phase of the study examines the use and               characterization of statistical evidence in recent trial data in                order to identify and analyze central points of confusion and                   judgment errors such as the source probability error and the                    numerical conversion error.  The second phase is a pilot study to               conduct a series of experiments with mock jurors and practicing                 judges to examine how the context, manner, and vividness of                     quantitative testimony from experts affect fact-finder's                        probabilistic judgment and verdicts.  The study will provide the                empirical foundation for: (1) testing the strengths and                         weaknesses of theories about intuitive quantitative reasoning;                  (2) understanding of the nature and significance of misleading                  claims about statistical trace evidence; (3) developing standards               for quantitative expert testimony; and (4) suggesting appropriate               quantitative training for law curricula.",
