 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this investigation is to conduct preliminary                     research activities with a view to designing a research                         proposal related to the impact of problem-posing instruction                    (for teachers) on the teaching and learning process of                          problem solving (for high school students).  A major goal of                    this study is to explore the feasibility of examining                           cognitive and affective changes in student problem-solving                      behavior resulting from teacher in-service training in                          mathematical problem posing.                                                                                                                                    An in-depth pilot study will be conducted with a small group                    of six teachers from three different ethnic communities in                      New Mexico.  One teacher in each school will receive                            instructional treatment in learning to incorporate a                            problem-posing dimension into activities designed for                           classroom problem solving.  The other teacher in each school                    will receive no instructional treatment.  During the                            academic year, all six teachers will be expected to conduct                     instruction on problem solving.  Data on student problem-                       solving behavior will be collected from the classes taught                      by the six teachers.  The investigator will search for                          cognitive and affective changes in student problem-solving                      behavior resulting from the instructional treatment.                                                                                                            The study will employ a combination of data collection and                      analysis techniques using: student records maintained by the                    six teachers, specially developed problem-solving                               instruments, and interview instruments.",
