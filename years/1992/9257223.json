 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an NSF Young Investigator Award.  The research                          addresses the processing of nanoscale materials with unusual                    surface reactivity and physical properties for catalysis and                    ceramic applications.                                                                                                                                           One objective is to achieve highly dense materials at                           relatively low sintering temperatures by exploiting the small                   grain size and enhanced surface diffusion of nanometer-sized                    particles prepared by the gas condensation method.  Structural                  evolution of the nanostructured materials is observed by X-ray                  diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and photoacoustic                         infrared spectroscopy.  Mechanical properties of these                          materials are also analyzed for net-shape forming and high-                     temperature applications.                                                                                                                                       Nanostructural composites are synthesized as supported metal                    catalysts; these materials should offer high metal dispersion                   and                                                                             possibly enhanced catalytic activity, and can be engineered to                  have a high density of uniform nanoscale pores.  The thermal                    stability, selectivity, and reactivity of nanostructure                         catalysts in chemical manufacturing processes are studied and                   compared to those of catalysts produced by sol-gel synthesis                    or traditional impregnation methods.  Catalysts are                             characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering, Moessbauer                       spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, positron annihilation                    spectroscopy, and calorimetry.  Reaction kinetics of processes                  using the novel catalysts are followed with high-temperature                    photoacoustic infrared spectroscopy.",
