 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of the continuing development of its nationally                         recognized Workshop Physics program, the Department of Physics                  and Astronomy at Dickinson College is replacing Macintosh SE                    computers located in two introductory physics laboratories with                 Macintosh IIsi computers and color monitors which are linked by                 Ethernet to a file server, laser printers, and two video                        analysis stations already developed at Dickinson.  This                         equipment is being used intensively by both introductory                        physics students in the Workshop Physics courses and upperclass                 physics majors.  It is also being used by other groups at                       various levels: non-science students taking freshman seminars                   and other required science courses in the department; college                   and university teachers attending NSF sponsored summer                          workshops; minority high school students; high school girls                     visiting for a science career day; and local citizens learning                  to monitor radiation.The upgrade of equipment is occurring for                  several reasons.  Our older computers and Apple Talk network,                   now in their fifth year of service, lack the memory, disk                       storage capacity and speed to allow us to make full use of the                  capabilities of new software for spreadsheet modeling, video                    analysis, symbolic equation solving, data sharing and                           simulations.  Two recent NSF grants allow collaboration between                 Dickinson College, Tufts University and the University of                       Oregon for laboratory curriculum development aimed at helping                   other institutions make use of integrated computer tools and                    interactive teaching methods.  The work of these projects is                    being greatly enhanced by the availability of state-of-the art                  laboratory computer tools for the development and classroom                     testing of curricular materials.",
