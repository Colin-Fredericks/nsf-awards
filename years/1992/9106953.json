 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support two months of a six-month, long-term visit              by Professor Craig A. Tracy and his graduate student Mr. Morris                 Beatty of the Department of Mathematics at the University of                    California, Davis, to Japan for a cooperative research project with             Professor T. Miwa, Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences                 (RIMS) at Kyoto University.  Their collaborative research will                  involve continued investigation into isomonodromic t-functions that             arise from a holonomic quantum field theory of free fermions on                 manifolds.  This will be important in understanding and clarifying              the nature of phases for a quantum field theory in hyperbolic space;            and it should permit a transparent discussion of the zero curvature             limit.  Results of the research should have implications for                    holonomic quantum fields, integrable systems and differential                   geometry.                                                                                                                                                       The research is of fundamental importance with respect to                       isomonodromy problems in mathematical physics.  Both groups are                 well-respected experts in their field.  RIMS is the ideal Institute for         the researchers to carry out their research.  At Kyoto they will be             working with the inventors of the notion of a t-function; Professors            Mikio Sato, Tetsuji Miwa and Michio Jimbo.  They are all known                  for their innovative approach to holonomic quantum fields and                   associated isomonodromic transformations.  In addition, there are               many experts in Riemann surface theory at the Institute.  It is                 expected that, following the expiration of this award, collaborations           between the researchers are likely to continue.",
