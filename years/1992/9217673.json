 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) will undertake an               engineering development and testing program to upgrade a suite of               Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS') for deployments of up to one year.             Approximately thirty OBS' have been made available to the ocean                 science community.  Half of the instruments are maintained on the               East Coast at WHOI, and an equal number on the West Coast at                    Scripps.  The suite of instruments were designed to have common                 capabilities and response characteristics, and modular design was               use2d so various components could be readily upgraded.  The                     standard battery packs and data loggers allow for deployments of                only two months.  Scientific requirements increasingly call for                 longer deployments, lasting up to one year.  Two of the standard                OBS' will be converted with new battery packs and corrosion                     preventative measures.  One of the units will be deployed offshore              for a year, but checked on a regular basis.  Results of this                    development and testing program will be shared with other                       institutions that use the instruments.",
