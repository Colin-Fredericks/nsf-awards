 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine heterogeneous telecommunication                 networks, and develop novel solutions techniques for designing                  these networks to survive under link or node failure.  The                      interconnections of Local Area Networks (LANs), the connection of               LANs to Wide Area Networks (WANs), the interconnection of WANs, are             all examples of heterogeneous data networks. Each of these                      networking problems have unique characteristics based on the                    communications protocols and the routing behavior of the                        interconnect devices.  The research will consider the design                    problem for heterogeneous networks in the framework of formulating              a cost minimizing mathematical programming (or optimization)                    approach.  Survivable data networks are a special class of                      minimum-weight k-connected capacitated spanning networks.                       Designing minimum-weight k-connected spanning networks is NP-hard.              The problems that this research addresses involve the consideration             of additional constraints, and are also NP-hard.  The solution                  techniques are based on a hybrid of simulated annealing and graph               theory.  In addition to successfully implementing these methods for             some heterogeneous network design problems, the PIs propose to work             on the design of international heterogeneous telecommunications                 networks.",
