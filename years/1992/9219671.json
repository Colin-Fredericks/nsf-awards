 "awd_abstract_narration": "Passage of the High Performance Computing Act of 1991                      initiated an active cycle of planning for implementation of the                 National Research and Education Network (NREN) by federal                       agencies, educational institutions, and private sector firms.                   Many of these agencies and organizations have previously been                   active in networking but a number are new to the field as a                     result of expansion o the scope of the NREN during Congressional                deliberations.                                                                       To assist the study process and NREN constituent                           organizations in their own activities, a two day policy and                     planning workshop is planned.  The workshop will serve several                  important goals:                                                                     -bring together in a single forum one hundred o the                        individuals most directly concerned with NREN planning and                      implementations;                                                                     -provide an informed critique of policy proposals and                      positions from organization with roles in the implementation and                operation of the NREN;                                                               -reduce to written form the consensus of the workshop on the               major policy issues on which the Congress has requested an                      Executive Branch study.                                                              The consensus of the workshop does not imply unanimity with                respect to proposals for future Congressional or Executive Branch               actions involving the NREN.  However, it is expected that                       illumination of agreements and differences in policy positions,                 and the reasons for deferring assessments, will be valuable to                  federal agencies and to the Congress in the evolution of the NREN               program.                                                                             This conference will bring together policy level                           representatives from the numerous constituencies which are                      essential for the design, development, deployment, and operation                of a robust, high performance computer network to meet pressing                 needs for improved research collaboration and productivity in the               United States.",
