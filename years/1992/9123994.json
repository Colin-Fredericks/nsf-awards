 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for approximately                           twelve U.S. mathematicians to participate in a workshop                         on the topic of Inverse Problems to be held in                                  Sodankyla, Finland, from June 14 to 20, 1992.  The                              workshop is jointly organized principally by Professor                          John Sylvester of the University of Washington and                              Professor Lassie Paivarinta of the Mathematics                                  Department of the University of Helsinki.  Research in                          this area of applied mathematics is growing in Finland,                         and the government and private foundations in Finland                           are providing the major support for the meeting and                             publishing the proceedings.  Rapid advances in the field                        offer opportunities for research and applications that                          did not exist just a few years ago.  The workshop will                          focus on three areas of multidimensional inverse                                problems where the recent interchange of ideas has been                         particularly fruitful, and where increased international                        interaction should provide significant acceleration in                          progress.  These topics are inverse scattering,                                 impedance tomography, and multidimensional inverse                              spectral problems.  Expected participants include some                          of the outstanding contributors in these fields.                                                                                                                The subject of inverse problems includes the                                    mathematical foundations of scientific problems in                              diverse areas of practical interest from seismology to                          radar.  New methods have been developed in the past five                        years that have stimulated rapid progress in                                    multidimensional inverse problems of many kinds.  The                           workshop will serve as a means for disseminating                                information and encouraging collaboration among                                 researchers in different areas of this crossdisciplinary                        field.  It is specifically designed to enhance the                              training of postdoctoral and graduate students, as well                         as the more senior participants, from Finland, the                              Soviet Union, Europe and the U.S.  The location is a                            particularly convenient setting for Soviet researchers,                         who use different methods from their foreign                                    counterparts, to meet American  mathematicians and                              exchange ideas.",
