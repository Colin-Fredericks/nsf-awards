 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports three visits by Dr. Martin                                  Golubitsky and three by Dr. Ian Melbourne, of                                   the University of Houston, University Park,                                     over three years, to the University of Sydney,                                  Australia, to work with Dr. M.J. Field on                                       several problems in both the theory and                                         application of bifurcations in the presence of                                  symmetry.  They will study the iteration of                                     symmetric maps (symmetric chaos) and its                                        manifestations in systems of ordinary and                                       partial differential equations, and the                                         stability of heteroclinic cycles (which occur                                   naturally in symmetric systems).  Although                                      many have studied the effect of symmetry on                                     both the dynamics and bifurcation of systems                                    of differential equations, few have paid                                        attention to discrete dynamical systems with                                    symmetry (where the new phenomenon of                                           symmetry-increasing bifurcations forced by the                                  collision of conjugate chaotic attractors and                                   drifting along group orbits seems to occur                                      rather frequently).  The researchers will                                       investigate the possibility that symmetry                                       increasing bifurcations are related to the                                      existence of coherent structures in certain                                     fluid dynamical systems where symmetry (on                                      average) is observed.  For example, turbulent                                   Taylor vortices are observed in the Couette-                                    Taylor experiment (in which fluid flow between                                  two independently rotating concentric                                           cylinders is studied).  This fluid state                                        demonstrates rather dramatically the                                            coexistence of turbulent motion with                                            distinctive patterns on average which may well                                  be related to the coexistence of chaotic                                        dynamics with the symmetry on average of                                        symmetric attractors.  Heteroclinic cycles are                                  associated with the existence of intermittency                                  and bursting phenomena, thus providing                                          interesting dynamics.  Except in isolated                                       cases, there are few optimal results                                            concerning the asymptotic stability of such                                     invariant sets.  The researchers propose to                                     investigate the possibility that the                                            techniques used so far can be unified to give                                   a more coherent theory.",
