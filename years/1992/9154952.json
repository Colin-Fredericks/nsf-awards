Participants will learn the philosophy and methodology of science               research by immersion into the research activity of a senior staff              of twelve members of the Department of Physics and Astronomy and                other faculty in the physical science departments of the College of             Basic Sciences.  In addition, all students will participate for the             duration of the program in seminars led by the senior staff at LSU              and science departments in the other colleges and universities in               Louisiana who will present topics in their areas of specialization.             These seminars will expose the scholars to the nature and                       excitement of space research and its application to additional                  disciplines such as computer and information science, geophysics                and the environmental sciences.",
