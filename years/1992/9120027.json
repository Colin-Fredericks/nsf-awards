It                                  was installed under NSF grant CEE-82-19432                                      and has continued to be fully operational                                       through subsequent support from the National                                    Science Foundation, supplemented by support                                     from the Instituto de Ingenieria, Universidad                                   Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.  The array is                                      currently recording accelerograms from 50 to                                    80 earthquakes each year, and the resulting                                     data set includes records from over 25                                          significant earthquakes, with four earthquakes                                  having magnitudes 6.9 or greater at close                                       range.  Most important, it is located in a                                      mature seismic gap where an earthquake with                                     magnitude up to 8.2 is considered more likely                                   to occur than any at other place in North                                       America.                                                                                                                                                        The objectives of the Guerrero array are: (a)                                   To obtain high quality accelerograms from                                       strong shaking caused by magnitude 7.5 to 8                                     earthquakes along the Mexican subduction                                        thrust; (b) to distribute these data and to use                                 them to predict the strong ground motions                                       from future earthquakes with sufficient                                         precision so as to be useful for engineering                                    applications; and (c) in particular, to address                                 the problem of ground motion on basement                                        rock in a subduction zone environment similar                                   to that found in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest                                  and Puerto Rico.                                                                                                                                                This action is for continued operation of this                                  array; to catalog and distribute any new data                                   recorded; to interpret the accelerograms that                                   have been recorded; and to use the best                                         available methods to attempt to predict the                                     nature of the strong ground motions resulting                                   from anticipated future subduction-zone                                         earthquakes.",
