 "awd_abstract_narration": "A distinctive and much debated feature of the US banking and                    financial system is the separation of commercial banking and                    investment banking which is legislated by the Glass-Steagall Act                of 1933.  Before 1933, commercial banks and their securities                    affiliates competed directly with investment banks in the                       business of underwriting and originating securities.  The purpose               of this project is to analyze and evaluate the arguments for and                against universal banking by examining the investment banking                   activities of commercial banks prior to the Glass-Steagall Act.                 Information will be collected from a variety of financial                       publications from the 1920s and 1930s.  These data will allow the               comparison of underwriting activities and performance of                        commercial banks and independent investment banks.  The project                 will explore the empirical relevance of arguments made in the                   1930s and today against universal banking--e.g., potential                      conflicts of interest when lending and underwriting are permitted               under one roof, ability to take advantage of unsophisticated                    depositors, and monopolistic control of access to capital markets               for small and medium sized firms. The arguments for universal                   banking include potential economies of scope in information                     gathering and processing.  In addition, the effect of commercial                banks' internal organizational structure on the performance of                  their investment banking activities will also be investigated.                  This project is particularly timely and important given the great               interest in banking reform.",
