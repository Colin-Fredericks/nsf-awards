 "awd_abstract_narration": "Poisonous snakes use venom for immobilizing and digesting prey.                 Crotalid and viperid venoms are complex mixtures of toxins and                  enzymes which are extremely effective in destroying tissue and                  causing hemorrhage.  Physical, chemical, and immunological                      properties of venom suggest that a number of hemorrhagic factors are            present in a single venom sample.   Even though many hemorrhagic                factors are common to several species of snakes and some of the                 amino acid sequences are similar, geographical variation in                     hemorrhagic factors have been demonstrated within certain species.              Although envenomation is an effective way to capture prey, we were              among the first to show that a number of mammals, such as the                   opossum and the grey woodrat, exhibit resistance to lethal toxicity,            proteolytic and hemorrhagic activities os snake venoms.  We have                isolated antihemorrhagic factors that are not antibodies in the sera of         resistant mammal.  The nature of the resistance is significant, since it        is broad-spectrum and neutralizes all hemorrhagic toxins tested thus            far.                                                                            The proposed research will expand and correlated the hemorrhagic                variation found in rattlesnake venoms (Crotalus sp.) with the                   antihemorrhagic variation found in resistant animals.  The goal of the          RIMI proposal is to examine, using recombinant DNA techniques, a                hypothesis of correlation between a venomous predator and venom-                resistant prey.  The information derived from this study will also be           crucial to understanding the mechanism of venom detoxification in               resistant species and in developing potential uses of snake toxins in           medical science such as the production of immunotoxins.                         The RIMI proposal will expand our present venom research program                and more students and faculty will be involved.  Both students and the          University will benefit by such an expansion.  The teaching load is             heavy and undergraduate students require intensive training before              they are capable of doing meaningful research.  Many of our                     undergraduate and masters' students working under the direction of              Dr. John C. Perez have published in professional journals before going          on to major universities for doctoral research.  With the RIMI program,         three additional faculty would be working with minority students in a           very active research program.",
