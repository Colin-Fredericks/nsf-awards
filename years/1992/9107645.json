The work will involve exposing microspores by                                   making a cut in the anther wall prior to micro-                                 projectile bombardment and the pollen will then                                 be matured in anthero.  If and when this                                        preliminary work indicated that the system                                      seems to be working well, the pollen matured in                                 anthero will be used for pollination to study                                   stable transformation of maize plants.  Maize                                   is a very important agricultural crop both in                                   Eastern Europe and the US and a simple                                          transformation procedure using pollen would be                                  of significance for basic studies in genetics                                   and developmental biology of the plant and in                                   the engineering of new traits of agronomic                                      value.                                                                                                                                                          This project in plant physiology fulfills the                                   program objective of advancing scientific                                       knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                    United States and Eastern Europe to combine                                     complementary talents and pool research                                         resources in areas of strong mutual interest                                    and competence.",
