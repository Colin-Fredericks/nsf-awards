The purpose of the                       workshop is to generate a set of practical recommendations on how               the United States Government (USG) and the Commission of the                    European Communities (EC) can improve their dialogues with the                  public about biotechnology.    The forty professional science                   communicators (20 U.S. and 20 EC) selected as participants all                  have first-hand experience in communicating with the public on                  biotechnology issues.  Drawing on the experience of the experts,                the workshop will generate recommendations on (1) how to                        accurately assess public opinion, (2) how to establish a flow of                information between (to and from) governmental entities and the                 public, (3) the role of government institutions, scientists,                    public interest groups, educators and the media in science                      communications, and (4) how to evaluate the success or failure of               communication efforts.  The recommendations of the workshop will                be presented to the U.S.-EC Task Force on Biotechnology Research                in October 1982.",
