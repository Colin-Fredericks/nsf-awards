 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on Holocene landscape evolution in the                            Mediterranean region concerns the relative impact of climate                    change and human activity on episodes of erosion and valley                     alluviation.  The complex nature of geomorphic response to                      climate change often results in differing landscape adjustments                 to a given stimulus within a single drainage basin, resulting in                temporal lags in certain portions of the basin as the system                    progressively adjusts to the new conditions.  Because the                       character and intensity of anthropic disturbances vary spatially                and temporally, geomorphic responses to these stimuli are                       typically asynchronous and more variable.  One approach to                      assessing causality is to conduct tandem studies in several                     different basins which have been subject to different types and                 intensities of cultural activity while experiencing similar                     shifts in climate.  This project addresses the overall question                 of late Quaternary landscape change in southern Italy by                        examining the stratigraphy and sedimentology of alluvial and                    colluvial deposits in six drainage basins.  It will integrate                   geomorphic, sedimentologic, and pedological evidence with                       regional paleoenvironmental, archaeological, and historical data                in order to generalize about the nature and timing of landscape                 change.  Sediment data will be collected in the field, and they                 will be augmented by laboratory analysis and aerial and                         topographic map analysis to determine the causes of landscape                   change.                                                                              Results of this research will add new knowledge on the                     regional geomorphology of the Mediterranean region, and it will                 establish the relative importance of climate and human causative                factors in the evolution of the landscape during the late                       Quaternary.",
