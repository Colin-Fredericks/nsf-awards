 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of Professor Glymour's study is the application of formal             methods developed by statisticians, computer scientists,                        mathematical psychologists and philosophers of science (including               the PI and his former student, Dr. Kevin Kelly) to aspects of                   cognitive psychology.  Specifically, Professor Glymour is                       investigating the contexts in which contemporary cognitive                      psychology may not turn into a successful research program because              the questions cognitive psychologists seek to address are radically             underdetermined by the kind of evidence available to them.  In                  undertaking this study of contemporary cognitive psychology,                    Professor Glymour uses  Sigmund Freud's scientific efforts until                the turn of the century as a kind of methodological model.  He                  argues that Freud's theoretical and methodological approaches in                the 1890s are in important respects those of many contemporary                  cognitive psychologists.  He further suggests that Freud's                      scientific enterprise did not turn into a successful research                   program for the same reasons that he sees problems with                         contemporary cognitive science:  the questions are underdetermined              by the evidence.  Finally, he wants to argue that it is just those              points that contemporary cognitive psychology share with Freud's                theory, i.e. similar goals and methodological limitations, that                 lead to this problem in contemporary science.  The aim of this                  study is not to argue that contemporary cognitive psychology ought              not to be done or ought not to be supported.  The aim is to                     emphasize the importance of articulating alternatives and giving                frank consideration to how much or how little an experiment or an               entire research program can do to distinguish among these                       alternatives.",
