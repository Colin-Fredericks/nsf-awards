The U.S. team will                                  be headed by Dr. David Smith, professor of                                      medicinal chemistry at Purdue University.  The                                  Pakistani organizer is Dr. Zafar H. Zaidi of                                    the HEJ Postgraduate Institute of Chemistry at                                  the University of Karachi.  The symposium                                       speakers include four each from Germany and                                     India, three from the United Kingdom, and one                                   each from France, Sweden, Australia, Iran and                                   China, in addition to five from the U.S. and                                    speakers from Pakistan.   The four day                                          symposium will be followed by a ten day                                         workshop for training graduate students and                                     junior scientists on isolation and                                              identification of proteins, their compositions                                  and their functions.  Proceedings of all                                        symposium papers will be published after the                                    meetings.                                                                                                                                                       Scope:  This project supports a significant                                     meeting on an important topic in basic science                                  that has many direct applications in health and                                 agriculture.   Previous meetings in this series                                 had good results in establishing links between                                  Pakistani young scientists and U.S. and other                                   western scientists, and between scientists of                                   the South Asia region especially Pakistan,                                      India, and Bangladesh.  The host institute has                                  excellent facilities for research in this area                                  of analytical biochemistry.  The Karachi area                                   is well suited because of the concentration of                                  the pharmaceutical and the natural medicines                                    industries of Pakistan there.  The project fits                                 well the guidelines of the Science in                                           Developing Countries program.",
