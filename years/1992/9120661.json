 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preservation of biological diversity requires that variation               in the landscape, and its importance to population persistence be               well understood.  Studies using traditional methods have                        demonstrated that a relationship exits between bird species and                 vegetation composition and structure, but have not been able to                 evaluate how this variation affects population statistics.                      Recently developed geographic information systems (GIS)                         analytical techniques using Landsat satellite images will be                    combined with a long-term data set on populations of the Yellow-                eyed Junco, to better understand the potentially large influence                of landscape variation on the structure and persistence of                      populations.  Fine-scaled landscape characteristics will be                     linked to estimates of survivorship and mortality, productivity,                movement patterns and abundance patterns.  The proposed research                will provide a new paradigm for researchers studying bird                       population biology and conservation.  It will also test the                     effectiveness of \"patch occupancy\" models in estimating                         demographic trends and predicting population persistence.  If                   accurate \"patch occupancy\" models can be developed, it will be                  possible to collect such data on many more species in a greater                 array of habitats than can now be accomplished with labor                       intensive mark- recapture studies.  Conservation biologists and                 government agencies need cost effective, accurate methods of                    evaluating habitat, estimating bird population trends and                       predicting population persistence.  The proposed research will                  help develop these models and analytical techniques.",
