 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of life history evolution, which began to develop               in the 1930's and matured through the 1980's, represents a                      generalization of the concept of fitness.  Fitness is now defined               with complete variables, such as the ability of a genotype to                   increase in population size.  Under this theory, natural                        selection can do seemingly counter-intuitive things.  For                       example, it is possible for natural selection to favor a                        reduction in lifespan or a reduction in the number of offspring                 produced, provided that there are other compensations.  The goal                of this resolves is to test life history theory in natural                      populations of guppies from the island of Trinidad.                                  \"Life history\" refers to features of animals that directly                 influence the production of offspring, such as when animals begin               to reproduce, how often they reproduce, how many offspring they                 have, and the resources devoted to each offspring.  Most natural                populations are exposed to different patterns of mortality, such                as different rates of mortality in adults versus juveniles.                     Theoreticians have considered how this aspect of natural                        selection will select for changes in features of the life                       history.                                                                               Different populations of guppies in Trinidad appear to                   experience such differences in age-specific mortality because of                their predators.  Some populations have predators that prey                     predominantly on large, sexually mature size classes of guppies                 while others have predators that feed primarily on small,                       immature size classes.  Size-specific predation appears to cause                differences in age-specific mortality rates.  One prediction is                 that higher adult mortality rates will favor those individuals                  that begin to reproduce earlier and devote more of their                        resources to reproduction and less to their own growth and                      maintenance.  These predictions are being evaluated by; 1)                      quantifying the differences in life history patterns of guppies                 from these two types of localities, 2) quantifying the mortality                rates of guppies in natural populations, and 3) changing the                    distribution of guppies and their predators in natural streams to               drive the evolution of life history patterns.  This project has                 already revealed the process of evolutionary change in natural                  populations and will ultimately make it possible to evaluate the                mechanism of this change.  At the same time, it evaluates a                     branch of evolutionary theory which incorporates a more general                 definition of fitness.",
