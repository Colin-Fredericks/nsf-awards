 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering                 at Cornell University (Cornell Theory Center) proposes a                        collaboration with the Center for Research on Parallel                          Computation (CRPC),  headquartered at Rice University, for                      research in the development of scaleable parallel programs in a                 scientific programming environment.                                                                                                                             Ken Kennedy;s research group at Rice has developed a prototype                  parallel programming environment called ParaScope \u01314,5,6!.                      Cornell is one of about twenty sites that have received this                    software for testing and evaluation.  We propose to work together                                                                                               to evaluate and deploy this software.  The goal of the proposed                 research is twofold:  (1) to see how useful such an environmen is                                                                                               for scientific programming, and (2) to determine how extensible                 such and environment is, in scaleability and retargeting to                     different manchines.                                                                                                                                            The time is ripe for such a study because of the tool's maturity                                                                                                and because of the growing need to retarget user programs quickly                                                                                               to new systems.  The High Performance Computing and                             Communications Initiative will further encourage the                            proliferation of parallel systems as new approaches to parallel                 computing are explored.  For the next five years, rapid change in                                                                                               our field demands parallel programming tools such as Parascope                  that can be quickly adapted to support new target parallel                      architectures.",
