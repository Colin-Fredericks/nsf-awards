 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale distributed programming, where processes communicate           via messages, is a reality whereas large-scale shared variable                  programming remains an ill-understood activity.  It is postulated that          the distinction between these two classes is the type of                        communication-it is disciplined in the former case and arbitrary in             the latter case.  Furthermore, implementations of shared-variable               systems on multiprocessors with individual caches pose several                  problems, including cache-coherence.  This work attempts to impose              certain disciplines on shared variable programming so that large-scale          system design becomes feasible and the implementations avoid most of            the issues associated with cache coherence.                                          The plan of research is to identify a substantial class of                 shared-variable systems that enjoy some of the advantages of                    distributed (i.e., message-passing) systems.  The systems will be               constrained to a class called loosely-coupled, in which the                     computations of different processes are largely non-interfering even            though they share variables.  Loosely-coupled systems will acquire              certain properties-such as absence of \"race conditions\" -normally               associated with distributed systems.  Designs of loosely-coupled                systems will be accomplished without extensive analysis of scenarios            based on execution sequences, process interactions or deadlock.                 Compositional proof theories for such systems will be developed and             the efficient implementation of such a system on multiple-memory                multiprocessor architectures will be indicated.",
