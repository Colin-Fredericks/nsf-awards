 "awd_abstract_narration": "There will be two major thrusts to this program.  First, the                    chemical mechanisms of fullerene formation in a sooting flame                   will be investigated, with an end-goal of developing an                         optimized inexpensive path to fullerene production.  As part                    of this activity, a thorough parameter-space search of the                      variables important to fullerene formation will be carried                      out, with guidance being provided by previous thermodynamic                     studies.  Inasmuch as these studies have indicated that                         temperatures in excess of  available adiabatic flame                            temperatures may be advantageous to fullerene production,                       experiments in which additional energy is coupled into the                      flames in the form of microwave or radio-frequency radiation                    will be carried out.  As part of this study, various possible                   mechanisms for fullerene production will be modelled and                        tested against data obtained in the experimental part of the                    study.  Secondly, the use of an infrared laser system to                        continuously monitor efficiency of hazardous waste                              incinerators will be studied.  Chemical kinetic modeling                        studies of incineration of chlorinated hydrocarbons have                        identified intermediates of combustion on whose infrared                        transmissions the lasers should be tuned; experiments to                        verify this approach to development of an effective continuous                  monitoring system will be carried out.                                                                                                                          Both research projects have important potential applications.                   In the first case, development of means for relatively                          inexpensive production of fullerenes is important to further                    development of potential uses for these materials.  In the                      second case, a current deficiency in incineration technology                    tending to block use of such methods is lack of an on-line                      real-time process monitor which can be incorporated in a                        controller scheme to minimize or eliminate escape of toxic                      materials during incinerator operation transients resulting                     from various causes.",
