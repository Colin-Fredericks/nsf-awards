 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to understand the flow mechanism of                 microphase-separated block copolymers in the strong-segregation                 limit (SSL).  Microphase-separated block copolymers are chemically              composite materials which play a prominant role in the formulation              of many advanced materials.  New material design requires an in-                depth understanding of the physics of the component materials and               of the interaction of their physics with processing.                                                                                                            The research focusses on three tasks:  First, they intend to                    observe directly the flow morphology of block copolymers in the SSL             using small-angle neutron scattering.  Second, they will do a                   comprehensive comparison between the rheological properties of                  samples with macroscopically ordered mesophases versus isotropic                materials.  Third, they will elucidate the impact of mesophase                  shape on linear-viscoelastic properties.  Since microphase-                     separated block copolymers are very much like well-mixed                        incompatible polymer blends, the experiments performed will also                bear on general questions in polymer thermodynamics, such as                    whether shearing a binary mixture can affect its phase diagram.",
