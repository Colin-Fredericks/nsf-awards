 "awd_abstract_narration": "A maternal effect influencing DNA endoreduplication activity in the             developing endosperm of maize has been observed in data generated               by flow cytometric techniques.  The overall objective of this                   project is to expand the information concerning these maternal                  effects in the developing endosperm.  Specifically, tests will be               made to determine: (1) the extent of the maternal effects in                    reciprocal crosses among a wide range of inbreds; (2) the precise               characteristic(s) that are governed by the maternal effects; and                (3) the role of these maternal effects in the cytokinetics of the               developing endosperm.  Flow cytometric analyses of endosperm will               be obtained from a diallel pattern of parents and F1 reciprocal                 crosses at the peak of endoreduplication activity and at closely                spaced intervals over an extended developmental period.                         Brd/Urd/monoclonal antibody techniques in conjunction with an in                vitro ear culture system will be used to determine the role of                  maternal effects upon cell cycle phases and DNA replication rates.              The information could lead to new ideas about DNA replication, cell             cycle timing, genome interaction, and even combining ability and                hybrid vigor.  The possibility exists that such information might               eventually be used in a predictive manner for the selection of                  parents for hybridization.",
