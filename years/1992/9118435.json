 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a 24 month long-term visit by Dr. Stanley               Skebe, Aerodynamics and Environmental Sciences Division, United                 Technologies Research Corporation (UTRC), Hartford, Connecticut,                to Japan for a cooperative research project with Professor                      Shunichi Tsuge, Institute of Engineering Mechanics, University of               Tsukuba.  The research will include a study of the effect of                    vortex generation devices on diffuser performance.  The focus                   would be to conduct an experimental investigation into the                      application of several standard and advanced vortex generator                   shapes within a family of rectangular diffuser geometries and                   over a range of flow parameters and to quantify their ability to                alleviate diffuser stall and improve diffuser performance through               mixing enhancement.  Supporting theoretical calculations, based                 on 'first principles' analyses, would also be performed.  Smoke                 trace, tuft motion, and surface oil flow visualization techniques               would be used to document diffuser stall reduction while                        pneumatic pressure transducer measurements would yield diffuser                 pressure coefficient values upon which to base performance                      improvement.  Finally, they will undertake a detailed boundary                  layer survey and state-of-the-art laser sheet flow visualization                measurements.  These measurements are expected to broaden the                   applicability of the program results and deepen their                           significance with respect to the field of fluid mechanics by                    providing a fundamental understanding of the effect of embedded                 axial vortex arrays on adverse pressure gradient boundary layer                 flow separation characteristics.                                                                                                                                Diffusers see frequent component application in a wide variety of               fluid dynamic-based products, such as consumer appliances, home                 and building air handling systems, chemical plants, automobile                  components, and aircraft engines.  They are also often the key                  product component, with their efficiency level restricting the                  upper limit of overall product efficiency.  Improved diffuser                   designs could improve product performance and allow for a                       reduction in product noise generation and/or energy consumption.                This research combining United Technologies Research Center's                   accumulated experience on vortex generation and forced mixing                   flowfields with the University of Tsukuba's theoretical and                     experimental experience on the behavior of vortex generation                    should provide a productive climate for advancing the research in               this important area.  It is expected that this collaborative                    effort will continue after the formal agreement has terminated.",
