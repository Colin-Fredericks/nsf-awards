 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are numerous economic environments where agents use some of               their resources for directly unproductive purposes.  Rent-                      seeking, influence activities in organizations as well as                       expenditures on armaments are some activities which can be                      classified in this category.  Although undertaking such                         activities is an individually rational enterprise, the social                   outcome is typically inefficient.  The purpose of this research                 is to analyze a series of topics using models where agents                      allocate their resource endowments between productive inputs and                directly unproductive activities.  Total output depends on the                  productive inputs and it is distributed among the agents                        according to their relative contributions in the directly                       unproductive activity.  This distribution mechanism sharply                     contrasts with the competitive mechanism in at least one respect:                                                                                               Agent-specific productivity improvements are disadvantageous to                 the agent who undertakes them.  Related topics examined in this                 setting include the determinants of the individual welfare of                   agents; the primary reasons for inefficiency and incentives for                 the adoption of alternative allocation mechanisms; individual                   behavior within groups; and dynamic efficiency and distributional               effects.  The research is of descriptive as well as of normative                significance for variety of institutional environments where the                primary means of distribution are directly unproductive                         activities.",
