 "awd_abstract_narration": "Consistent with the mission of the JVNCnet which is to support             the Academic and Research networking communities in the Northeast               and to facilitate the provision of networking services to these                 institutions, Princeton is requesting partial support for the                   addition of 15 predominantly undergraduate institutions to the                  NSFNET family of networks through the JVNCnet midlevel network.                      Each institution has separately included information regarding             their facility and their need to be a member of the NSFNET.  The                list of schools includes: St Joseph College - CT, County College of             Morris - NJ (2yrs), Essex County College - NJ (2yrs), Princeton                 Theological Seminary - NJ, Raritan Valley College - NJ (2yrs),                  Union County College - NJ (2yr), Bucks County College - PA (2yr),               Lehigh County College - PA (2yr), York College - PA, Iona College -              NY, Ithaca College - NY, Mount Saint Mary - NY, Touro College -                NY.                                                                                  These fifteen institutions participating in this proposal                  represent the diversity of the educational system in the United                 States.  Schools range from two-year to four-year institutions,                 from primarily teaching facilities to research environments, and                from small to large student bodies.  All share the desire to gain               access to the resources and people made reachable through the                   NSFNET, with the goal of improving the quality of their educational             offerings and outreach to their communities.                                         JVNCnet, now part of Princeton University, will act as a                   regional or mid-level agent to identify the networking needs and                assist the academic institutions in the Northeastern United States              to meet those needs by providing connectivity, education and                    training.  In addition, the JVNCnet is working towards achieving                financial self-sufficiency by increasing its membership.",
