Groups of 20-25 students will                    attend 8-week courses at each institution, rotating to all                      three during the year.  After completing the courses, selected                  students will become interns for summer training and work at                    the institutions. The goals of the project are to offer                         engaging science to underserved children and motivate them to                   further study; to build a bridge to community groups from the                   three institutions; to bolster science programs at community                    centers through training their staff; and to create a                           replicable model for other science centers, children's museums                  and nature centers to work with community agencies and to                       involve parents in their children's activities.  Videotapes,                    to be produced by WGBH-PBS will be distributed to science                       centers: tapes will document finding effective ways to work in                  the children, the particular experiences of the three                           institutions, and the children's experiences with and                           attitudes toward science.  A summer institute will be held for                  museum professionals from other institutions.//",
