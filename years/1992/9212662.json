 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tenth Annual Southwestern Developmental Biology Conference                  will be held May 22-24, 1992 in Albuquerque, N.M. The meeting is                sponsored by the Society for Developmental Biology, which states                in its guidelines: \"The function of the Regional Conference is to               provide a more informal opportunity than national meetings for                  the exchange of information on development. Participation by                    graduate students, postdoctoral and junior faculty is                           particularly encouraged...\" The meeting will adhere to the goals                outlined above. For this conference, three prominent speakers                   (Drs. Cameron, Capco, and Eisen) have been invited to give papers               related to the following theme: \"Imaging Developmental                          Processes\". In addition, various developmental biologists from                  the Southwest will be encouraged to present recent and                          preliminary findings on this topic, or on any other field of                    developmental biology. The participation of graduate students and               postdoctoral fellows will be particularly promoted by providing                 financial support to cover the costs of registration, housing,                  and travel wherever possible. The conference  will thus give                    developmental biology students in the Southwest an excellent                    opportunity to give a talk, interact with a variety of                          investigators, and gain a better understanding of research bering               pursued in their own geographic region.",
