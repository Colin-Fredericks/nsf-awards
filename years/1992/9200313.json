 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study the relationship                     between the Laplacian of a compact manifold and the geometry of                 the manifold. He will attempt to determine the extent to which                  the spectrum of the manifold determines the class up to finitely                many topological types. The principal investigator will also                    study the relationship between spectrum and other geometric                     quantities such as diameter and injectivity radius.                                  This award will support research in the general area of                    differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry                is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space                and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                  the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of                a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                  these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                        structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                  the large scale structure of the universe.",
