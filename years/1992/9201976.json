 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measuring the intrinsic cost of herbivore resistance in                    plants is important both for assessing the potential for                        engineered genes to escape and persist in the environment, and                  for understanding how natural selection acts on defense resource                allocation in natural plant populations.  This study will apply                 two genetic approaches to testing the cost of resistance                        hypothesis.  First, the impact of resistance gene on plant growth               and resource allocation will be examined by comparing the                       performance of plants genetically  transformed for herbivore                    resistance with that of control plants of similar genetic                       backgrounds.  This work will be done in collaboration with the                  PROSAMO research group at Imperial College (Silkwood Park),                     headed by Dr. Michael J. Crawley.  Second, the principal                        investigator will test for negative genetic correlations among                  chemical defenses, growth, and reproduction in the absence of                   herbivores, and examine selection effects on defense production                 in natural populations of a common weed (Plantago lanceolata).                  This work, to be done in collaboration with Dr. Deane Bowers at                 the University of Colorado, will be one of the first studies to                 apply quantitative genetic analysis to chemical assays of plants                from natural populations.",
