 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interpretation of the biochemistry of fossil systems based on              the stable isotope composition of bulk organic matter assumes that              intramolecular diagenetic reactions and interactions with the                   preserving environment have a minimal effect on the isotopic                    integrity of these systems.  A realistic assessment of biogenic                 signals from fossils requires an appraisal of the limits of                     isotopic fractionation that can occur during diagenesis and the                 development of independent criteria for evaluating the possible                 exchange of components with the surrounding environment.  This                  project will begin to quantify the effects of hydrolysis and                    secondary diagenetic reactions (e.g. humification) on the stable                carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of amino acid constituents             of peptides and proteins in fossils.  Our recent development of a               combined gas chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry                     (GC/IRMS) methods for the direct stable carbon isotope analysis of              nanomole concentrations of amino acid enantiomers permits, for the              first time, an opportunity to monitor the effects of diagenetic                 reactions on most of the protein amino acids.  We will continue to              test the possibility of using the stable isotope compositions of                the D- and L-enantiomers of individual amino acid constituents of               fossils as an independent check on the indigeneity of these                     components.  At present, the GC/IRMS method is limited to the                   analysis of stable carbon isotopes;  however we propose to modify               the system for the analysis of stable nitrogen isotopes.  The                   ability to monitor both  13C and  15N compositions of individual amino          acid enantiomers affords a powerful, independent check on the                   indigeneity of these components.  Finally, experiments are also                 planned to develop GC/IRMS methods for the  13C analysis of                     carbohydrate constituents of fossil shells.",
