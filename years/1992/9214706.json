The successful completion                                of this project  will result in a comprehensive                                 and unified environmental laboratory complex.                                   Individual research and research training areas                                 will include: unit operations/advanced water and                                water waste treatment; instructional/research                                   training; aquatic and sediment chemistry research;                              microbiology; instrumentation; toxicology;                                      radiological microcomputer; storage; equipment                                  calibration/repair; glassware storage/washing.                                       Some of the research to be supported by the                                renovated facility includes: risk assessment                                    research - in a modern dedicated toxicology lab                                 overseen by a new faculty member; the continuation                              and expansion of breakthrough research to                                       determine toxic effects based upon acid volatile                                sulfide contents of sediments - in a dedicated                                  acquatic and sediment chemistry lab; investigation                              of new techniques for advanced treatment of water                               and wastes such as biological fluidized beds and                                odor control - in a renovated unit operations lab;                              and enhancement of research characterizing risk to                              the ecosystem and human health of genetically                                   engineered microorganisms - in a dedicated                                      microbiology lab.  Additionally, hundreds of                                    thousands of dollars of research instrumentation                                acquired under various sponsored projects will be                               housed in a climate controlled instrumentation                                  lab.",
