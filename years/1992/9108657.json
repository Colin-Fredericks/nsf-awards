 "awd_abstract_narration": "A seismometer based on high-temperature superconductivity                  (HTSC) is proposed.  The seismometers will remain on scale during               ground accelerations as great as 1 g, and will resolve ground noise             over a frequency range extending approximately from 10-4 hertz to               200 hertz.  This performance regime may ultimately be extended to               include periods of months and frequencies up to one kilohertz.                                                                                                       The HTSC seismometer will be the first single instrument                   capable of detecting virtually the entire spectrum of seismic                   phenomena.  This full-range seismometer will have broad                         applications in seismic observatories and networks, as well as                  special applications in nuclear test monitoring and high-frequency              seismometry.  By playing the roles of several conventional                      instruments, the HTSC seismometer will reduce the overall cost of               many seismic installations.                                                                                                                                          The performance advantages of the HTSC seismometer will be                 achieved by exploiting the inherent sensitivity and stability of                a displacement transducer based on modulations of the resonance                 frequency a high-Q superconducting tan circuit.  The use of this                transducer will simplify and miniaturize the suspension system of               the proof mass, as well as allowing the seismometer to resolve                  ground noise at increased frequencies.  The displacement transducer             will require no advances in HTSC technology.                                                                                                                         The use of high-temperature superconductors will allow the                 HTSC seismometer to operate downhole for periods of weeks or months             without replenishment of cryogens.",
