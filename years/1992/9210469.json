 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue research on ESR dating of prehistoric                archeological and hominid sites.  Energy is stored in natural                   materials as a result of bombardment by natural radioactivity.                  The amount of stored energy increases with time and can be used                 to determine the age of the material.  The amount of stored                     energy can be determined from the intensity of an electron spin                 resonance (ESR) signal displayed by these materials.  ESR dating                can be applied to tooth enamel of large mammals, and to quartz                  which has been heated in fires.  Tooth enamel is very commonly                  found in archaeological and hominid sites, and can be dated by                  ESR over a time range from a few thousand to over three million                 years with a precision of + 5 to 10%.  Burnt flint and quartz are               also common in archaeological sites.  ESR dating has been                       successfully applied to prehistoric sites in Europe, Africa and                 Asia, and has contributed to a revolutionary new view of the                    emergence of Modern Man.  This project will continue research on                methods of ESR analysis and application of the methods to sites                 now being studied by U.S. archaeologists and anthropologists.                   The laboratory at McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, is the                 only lab in North America carrying out such analyses, which have                been recognized world-wide for their importance to the chronology               of human evolution.",
