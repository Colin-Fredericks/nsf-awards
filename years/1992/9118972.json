 "awd_abstract_narration": "Identification of molecules and mechanisms involved in pattern                  formation in embryonic development has been a central problem of                developmental biology. Recently, studies of homeobox genes and                  retinoic acid have brought exciting new insights to the                         understanding of pattern formation. Dr. Chuong has recently found               homeoprotein gradients in developing feather buds and position                  specific homeoprotein expression patterns in different cutaneous                appendages. He also has showed retinoic acid causes a                           disorientation of feather axes and converted feathers into scale-               like structures in a concentration dependent manner. He                         hypothesizes that Hox gene expression is involved in determining                the phenotypes and orientation of cutaneous appendages in birds                 as has been found for appendage phenotypes in Drosophila. He will               examine the distribution of the Hox 4 complex during feather                    morphogenesis. He will analyze the effect of a retinoic acid                    gradient on feather pattern formation by arranging retinoic acid                soaked beads in a geometric pattern on cultured feather explants.               The function of the homeoprotein gradient will be tested directly               by disrupting the gradients with ectopically expressed Hox genes.               This work will combine classical feather morphogenesis                          experiments with modern molecular biology and offers an excellent               opportunity to provide clear answers to some fundamental issues                 of morphogenesis.",
