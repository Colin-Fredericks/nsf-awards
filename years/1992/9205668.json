Intelligent interface  agents are computer programs that employ artificial intelligence and other techniques  in order to provide expert, autonomous assistance to a user dealing with particular  computer applications.   This research addresses the question of learning as a method  by which an agent can acquire sufficient amounts of information about the user, the  application, and the communication and collaboration strategies to be able to empower  the user.   The goal of this project is to find the necessary and sufficient conditions  for the hypothesis to hold that an interface agent can be given access to the  information it needs to program itself.  The agent is given a minimum of background  knowledge and learns appropriate situation-action rules by observing the user's  interaction with the application, by receiving feedback from the user about certain  rules, and by copying the situation-action rules employed by agents assisting other  users in the same application.  The project will first develop a generic architecture for  building learning interface agents.  This will then be used in concrete examples to test  the main hypothesis.",
