 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves parallel theoretical and empirical                        investigations into the behavior of two sided matching markets,                 and related markets.  It focuses on the phenomenon of \"jumping the              gun,\" in which market transactions come earlier and earlier, in                 response to competition, and resulting in various types of market               failure.  Preliminary indications are that this may be a much more              common form of market failure than is generally recognized.  The                empirical part of the investigation will focus on a number of other             markets which appear to have experienced this phenomenon.  In this              regard, some of the markets which present promising targets for                 this investigation are labor markets in medicine (for specialty                 positions), law (for associate positions in law partnerships and                clerkships in Federal courts in the U.S., and for \"articling                    positions\" in Canada), dentistry (particularly oral surgery),                   clinical psychology (pre-doctoral internships), the entry level                 market for new graduates of elite Japanese universities, and the                market for post-season college football bowls.                                                                                                                  Preliminary indications are that most if not all of these markets               have at some point in their histories experienced similar market                failures, and have in many cases adopted specific institutional                 arrangements to deal with these failures.  One focus of the                     investigation will be to examine these market failures and the                  institutional arrangements developed in response.  Another focus                will be the degree and manner in which participants in these                    markets engage in strategic behavior adapted to particular                      institutional arrangements.  These issues also raise new                        theoretical problems, which will be pursued.",
