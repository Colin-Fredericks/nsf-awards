 "awd_abstract_narration": "The combination of the enormous DMSP data base of precipitating               particles and our several years experience in conducting                        statistical studies involving automated identification algorithms               suggests a highly fruitful line of research.  We propose to                     identify every instance of electron acceleration as evidenced by                monoenergetic electron peaks in 7 years of particle data.  We                   estimate that the resulting catalog will consist of approximately               500,000 electron acceleration events; approximately 3 orders of                 magnitude more than the largest previous study of electron                      acceleration events.  We will also record all instances of electron             or ion diffuse aurora above a certain threshold (probably 0.25                  ergs/cm2s).  The research will promptly answer some long standing               disputes such as the existence of a 1400 \"hot spot\" of electron                 acceleration; and the existence of a \"prenoon gap\" in the discrete              aurora.  The huge size of the electron acceleration even catalog                will make it possible to subdivide by interplanetary magnetic field             Bz and By conditions, as well as indices of magnetic activity, such             as Kp and AE.  That is, a result of the proposed research will be               maps of the statistical distribution of electron acceleration                   events throughout the high latitude regions, at all local times and             a variety of binning conditions.  Intense diffuse auroras will be               similarly studied; particular attention will be paid to instances               of ion energy fluxes exceeding that of electrons (true ion                      auroras).  Finally, the entire catalog of 500,000 electron                      acceleration events will be shared with the general ionospheric                 community.  convenient access to the entire list of auroras                     encountered by DMSP satellites on any specified day between                     December 1983 and December 1990 will also be provided.  Such access             will be accomplished in part by extending the existing automatic                response system of identifications of the magnetospheric source                 regions of precipitation.",
