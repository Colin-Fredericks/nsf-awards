Nagar of the                  Geodetic and Research Branch of the Survey of India in field                    research in India.  The objective is to use GPS geodesy to                      determine the vertical and horizantal positions of survey markers               spaced at crucial locations across the active Himalayan                         deformation that marks the collision zone between the                           Indo/Australian Plate and the Euro/Asian Plate.  This is part of                a larger project in which Dr. Bilham is also conducting similar                 studies in Nepal and Pakistan to cover various segments of the                  Himalayan deformation.                                                                                                                                          Scope:  This project allows for valuable cooperation between the                Indian team and the U.S. team.  Dr. Nagar is more familiar with                 the Indian conditions and is better prepared for long term data                 acquisition in that country, while Dr. Bilham can provide                       coordination with the neighboring countries as well as supply                   sophisticated instruments and broader expertise in measuring                    techniques.  The project fits well within the U.S.-India                        Cooperative Science Program criteria.",
