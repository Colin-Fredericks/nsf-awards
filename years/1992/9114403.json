 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been renewed interest in Hopf algebras in the last               several years because of the major example of quantum groups.                   General knowledge about Hopf algebras may be useful to those                    interested in quantum groups; conversely, quantum groups have                   introduced some new purely algebraic ideas into Hopf algebras.                  Independent of any connection to quantum groups, there have been                many new developments in Hopf algebras, including the solution of               two old conjectures.  There has also been much work extending                   facts about group actions to actions and coactions of Hopf                      algebras.  In addition, in light of the interest in Hopf algebra                techniques in ring theory, operator algebras, and combinatorics,                the field would appeal to an audience of Hopf algebraists, ring                 theorists, combinatorists, and operator algebraists.                                 This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research                    Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on Hopf Algebras and                    Their Actions on Rings to be held August 11-15, 1992 at DePaul                  University.  Professor Susan Montgomery of the University of                    Southern California will be the principal lecturer.  To stimulate               interest and activity in mathematical research, the National                    Science Foundation each year supports a number of NSF-CBMS                      Regional Research Conferences in the Mathematical Sciences.  Each               five-day conference features a distinguished lecturer who                       delivers ten lectures on a topic of important current research in               one sharply focused area of the mathematical sciences.  The                     lecturer subsequently prepares an expository monograph based upon               these lectures, which is normally published by the American                     Mathematical Society or the Society for Industrial and Applied                  Mathematics, or jointly by the American Statistical Association                 and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.  Certain features                 differentiate these conferences from typical research                           conferences.  These are: (1) Focus on a single important and                    timely area of research by a leading practitioner, (2) Continued                effect and local stimulation through regional emphasis, (3) Panel               review for quality, breadth, and timeliness, and (4) Published                  monographs for a wider audience.",
