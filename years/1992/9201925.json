 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, several issues have been raised concerning the use of                 comparative or interspecific data with standard statistical                     analyses.  Trait values measured in phylogenetically related                    groups of organisms are not statistically independent of each                   other, and must be corrected for degree of relatedness.  In                     addition, there is still much debate concerning which type of                   evolutionary relationships (and thus, evolutionary statistics)                  are of greatest interest to comparative biologists.  Although                   several solutions to these problems have been proposed, little is               known about how the proposed solutions relate to one another.                   All of the proposed methods require that the phylogeny of the                   organisms and an estimate of the expected amount of change for                  each trait be available.  As it is often difficult to obtain                    accurate estimates of expected amounts of character change,                     several techniques have been proposed to infer this information                 using independent estimates of time or by using the comparative                 data themselves.  Again, little is known about the relative                     abilities of the various techniques.  During this study the P.I.                will use a combination of mathematical and computer simulation                  techniques to compare the available methods for both analyzing                  comparative data and estimating expected amounts of change in                   terms of both their biological and statistical properties.",
