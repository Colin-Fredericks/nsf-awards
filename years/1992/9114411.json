 "awd_abstract_narration": "A combined theoretical/experimental study on the deformation                    behavior of high strength polymeric solids is proposed.  The                    mechanical testing machine capable of exerting uniaxial as well                 as biaxial loading paths with controlled loading rates.  The                    time-dependent behavior manifested by creep, relaxation and rate                sensitivity is of great interest here.  Initially we want to                    complete a uniaxial study of high strength nylon and concurrent                 microstructural investigations such as x-ray diffraction studies.               A fixture to accommodate tubular specimens subjected to axial,                  torsional and internal pressure loading will be designed and                    built.  Then a new test material will be chosen, preferably from                the class of polymeric, anisotropic, liquid crystals such as                    Xydar or Vectra, on which uniaxial and biaxial testing and                      microstructural investigations are contemplated.  In the                        theoretical part we propose to model the finite mechanical                      deformation behavior using state variable theories consisting of                coupled nonlinear differential equations.  The aim of the                       research is to combine synergistically phenomenological                         experiments, microstructural investigations and continuum                       mechanics to arrive at a mathematical model of the polymeric                    solid.",
