 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation of a U.S. team                of computer scientists and engineers in a Indo-U.S. workshop on                 \"Cooperative Research in Computer Science\" to be held in                        Bangalore, India, August 4 to 6, 1992.  The areas of expertise to               be represented include: robotics and computer vision, computer                  systems and networking, software engineering, and artificial                    intelligence.  The objectives of the workshop are to:  present                  papers by U.S. and Indian participants about the recent advances                in the various topical areas, identify research needs in each of                these areas, identify suitable areas for Indo-U.S. collaborative                research, and establish firm collaborations between U.S. and                    Indian scientists.                                                                                                                                              Scope:  This is the second Indo-U.S. workshop in the area of                    computer science.  The first was held in 1989 in the city of                    Hyderabad, India with participation from India's main                           governmental and private research organizations with interest in                computer research and applications.  Since that time a number of                collaborative activities have resulted.  The present project is                 designed to continue and intensify this mutually beneficial                     interaction and collaboration.  The project meets the objectives                of the U.S.-India Cooperative Science Program.",
