 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports U.S.-Belgium cooperative research in                        systematic biology between Ariena H.C. van Bruggen of the                       University of California at Davis and Monique Gillis of Ryks                    University in Gent, Belgium.  The objective of their research is to             investigate the taxonomy of the genus Rhizomonas and recently                   isolated Rhizomonas-like bacteria.  The investigators will determine            the relationships among soil borne bacteria closely related to                  Rhizomonas and classify the different groups found within                       Rhizomonas.  They will use modern methods of DNA and RNA                        sequencing, hybridization studies in developing data for                        classification of the groups.  The U.S. group brings to this                    collaboration their expertise in rDNA sequencing.  This is                      complemented by the Gent's group expertise in DNA and RNA                       hybridization and their extensive data base on bacterial genera.                                                                                                The taxonomy and relationships among groups of soil-borne                       bacteria have not been studied widely despite their possible use for            biological control of plant pathogens and  Further classification will          provide scientists with a means for differentiating among useful and            harmful bacteria. The project will provide new data on rRNA                     methods system that could be applied to the classification of the               majority of bacteria.",
