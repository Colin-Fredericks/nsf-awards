 "awd_abstract_narration": "The expected service demands in wireless information                       networks in the near future  exceed the current capabilities of                 these systems. Efficient allocation of the limited spectrum will                be a critical factor in the design of the next generation of                    wireless networks in  order to meet the future demands. We study                two issues related to the  resource allocation problem in                       wireless communication networks. These are the sharing of  the                  locally common, spatially reusable radio channel and the effect                 of the rapidly changing  topology. Regarding the first issue, we                propose a queuing model that captures the channel  allocation                   problem in radio networks. The major research goal is to                        characterize the system performance and to develop scheduling                   algorithms for sharing the resource efficiently.  The throughput                of the system and the average packet delay are the two                          performance measures of interest. In our previous research we                   characterized the throughput properties of  the above model and                 we gave maximum throughput scheduling algorithms. Regarding                     delay, we obtained the optimal scheduling policy in a network                   with tandem topology. We  wish to extend the above results with                 special emphasis on scheduling policies that are  implementable                 in the distributed environment of a radio network.  A stochastic                model  of time-varying topology is also proposed here. The                      understanding of the effect of the  time-variability on the                     stability and throughput of the system as well as the development               of transmission control algorithms that effectively take into                   account the topology information are the major research goals                   regarding changing connectivity.  Preliminary results  have                     already been obtained for a single-hop network.",
