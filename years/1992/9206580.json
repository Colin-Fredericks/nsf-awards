 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of this project is to define the role of                D-raf mediated signal transduction in the establishment and                     elaboration of pattern in Drosophila melanogaster. The specific                 aims of this project are as follows: 1) to test the model that                  activation of D-raf as a serine/threonine kinase depends upon                   induction of the \"terminal\" signal transduction pathway, 2) to                  characterize the pattern of D-raf protein distribution in                       development, and 3) to identify genes encoding other members of                 D-raf mediated signal transduction pathways. Since D-raf is the                 Drosophila homologue of the Raf-1 proto-oncogene, the                           characterization of its developmental role and the determination                of its mechanisms(s) of regulation will provide clues toward                    understanding signal transduction in higher organisms.                          Experiments have been designed in this proposal to address the                  following questions. Does the D-raf protein display a                           serine/threonine kinase activity as predicted by its homology                   with Raf-1? Is there a relationship between the phosphorylation                 state of D-raf and its ability to act as a serine/threonine                     kinase? Where in the cell, and at what developmental stages is                  the D-raf protein present? What other types of gene products act                in D-raf mediated signal transduction pathways? These questions                 will be answered using cell biological, genetic and molecular                   means.",
