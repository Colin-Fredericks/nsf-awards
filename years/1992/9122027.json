 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This project supports the travel and living expenses               for Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy of the Department of Physics, Quaid-I-                  Azam University (QAU) in Islamabad, Pakistan, to participate in a               research project with Drs. John W. Negele and Robert L. Jaffe at                the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge.  The                      project will be in the area of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the                role of quarks and gluons in determining the structure and                      properties of hadrons and nuclei.  This area has been subject of                research by the theoretical physics group at MIT for some time.                 Broad issues of the joint research include: development of                      nucleon models incorporating known constraints imposed by QCD;                  spin structure of the nucleon; calculation of elastic scattering                form factors for composit systems of quarks and gluons; direct                  excitation of quark and color degrees of freedom in various                     reactions; direct measurements of quark momentum in very high                   energy deeply inelastic electron scattering from hadron targets;                and creation of abnormal states of hadron matter and detecting                  their signatures in relativistic heavy ion collisions.                                                                                                          Scope:  This project extends collaboration, by the Pakistani                    scientist with the MIT group, that has started in the late 1980's               and that has resulted in a number of joint publications.  The                   past collaboration produced significant results in the field and                enhanced the capability of the QAU group to conduct research and                to publish.  In addition, there has been exchange of scientists                 and garduate students between the two groups.  The project meets                the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries program.",
