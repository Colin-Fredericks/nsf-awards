 "awd_abstract_narration": "A problem of major importance in biochemistry is the determination              of mechanisms by which different parts of proteins communicate with             one another.  The giant 200-subunit hemoglobin of the earthworm is              an important model system for such studies because ligand binding               is highly cooperative and subunit assembly is ligand-dependent and              is controlled by pH and calcium ions.  This laboratory has                      determined the amino acid sequences of chains a, b and c that form              a disulfide-linked trimer, which, together with a 4th heme-                     containing chain (sequenced by others) and non-heme linker chains,              associate to form the full-sized molecule.  The goal is to                      determine the subunit association equilibria, their calcium and pH              dependence and their linkage with oxygen binding.  These studies                will form the basis for understanding structure and function of the             intact molecule.  The hemoglobins from a wide range of                          invertebrates and vertebrates aggregate upon deoxygenation to form              complexes of lower affinity for oxygen than the separate                        components.  This is a control mechanism of considerable                        physiological and evolutionary importance.  A major long-term goal              is to determine the structures of the associated complexes and the              linkage between oxygen-binding and aggregation in amphibian, avian              and lamprey hemoglobins among vertebrates and echinoderm and                    molluscan hemoglobins among invertebrates.                                      %%%                                                                             Many proteins in nature are composed of smaller proteins which may              be are identical or different.  These subunits can sometimes affect             the structure of neighboring subunits and thus cooperatively                    \"communicate\" with one another.  The giant 200-subunit hemoglobin               of the earthworm is an important model system for such studies                  because when certain molecules bind to one subunit many subunits                change shape. The subunit shape is controlled by pH and calcium                 ions.  The primary structure is known of subunits a, b and c that               form a complex which, together with a 4th heme-containing subunit,              associate to form the full-sized molecule.  The goal is to                      determine how tightly the subunits associate, and what effect                   calcium and pH have on this association and with oxygen binding.                These studies will form the basis for understanding structure and               function of the intact molecule.  The hemoglobins from a wide range             of invertebrates and vertebrates aggregate upon deoxygenation to                form complexes of lower affinity for oxygen than the separate                   components.  This is a control mechanism of considerable                        physiological and evolutionary importance.",
