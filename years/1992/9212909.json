 "awd_abstract_narration": "This equipment grant will be used for acquisition of a high-                    speed data acquisition and analysis system which will be used                   with an existing five nanosecond pulse-width laser for                          combustion studies.  The system will allow for acquisition of                   sufficient data over the 5 nanosecond pulse width of an                         existing degenerate four-wave mixing laser combustion                           diagnostic to determine the temporal response of the system.                    In addition to acquiring the data, this system will process                     the information to provide a real-time measure of the                           performance of the combustion diagnostic system.                                                                                                                In its initial application, this data acquisition system will                   be integrated into an in-situ pulse laser based diagnostic for                  measurement of hydroperoxy radicals generated during the                        combustion of hydrocarbons.  This technique utilizes                            degenerate four-wave mixing of a low-lying absorption band of                   HO2 which is unique to that molecule, not having the                            spectroscopic interference problems associated with other                       absorption bands of this molecule in the fingerprint region of                  the electromagnetic spectrum.  Successful completion of this                    research program will provide a new diagnostic tool to probe                    hydrocarbon oxidation and provide new insight into the                          chemistry which limits efficiency and controls emissions from                   hydrocarbon combustion systems.",
