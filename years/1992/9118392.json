 "awd_abstract_narration": "In addition to its important role as a source of energy for                     photosynthesis, light plays an extremely important role in the                  regulation of plant development.  While much is known about the                 phytochrome system, responsive to wavelengths at the red end of                 the electromagnetic spectrum, little is known about photoreceptors              or their signal transduction chains at the blue end.  The                       investigator proposes to continue investigating a blue light                    mediated phosphorylation of a plasma membrane protein that is                   hypothesized to be involved in phototropism and perhaps other blue              light responses.  They plan to purify and characterize the protein              and other proteins which may interact with it in photoreception and             early signal transduction.  Studies of the system at the gene level             will be initiated by cloning and sequencing the genes encoding for              these proteins.  Elucidation of this system at the cell,                        biochemical and molecular levels should be a major step forward in              our understanding of how light regulates plant development.",
