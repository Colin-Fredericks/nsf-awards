 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator intends: (1) to continue his study of                     unstable periodic homotopy groups, using Adams spectral sequence                techniques and Bousfield localization; (2) to generalize joint work             with Mark Mahowald on v2 periodic homotopy groups of the fiber of               the secondary suspension map to higher periodicity; (3) to study                the localization of an unstable sphere with respect to the homology             theory E(n); (4) to study the unstable Adams-Novikov spectral                   sequence based on E(n); (5) to compute the mod-p K-theory of free               iterated loop spaces and apply this to the calculation of v1                    perioidic homotopy groups.                                                           Topology arose originally as an approach to the study of                   differential equations.  Over the intervening century it has                    evolved prodigiously, often seeming to have a life entirely its own             and independent of its source.  Increasingly, however, it has begun             to repay its debt.  The point is that it is often more important to             know of the solution of an equation whether it is a closed loop or              whether it is knotted, for example, than to know precisely and                  numerically what are the coordinates of all of its points.                      Furthermore, although the former qualitative information is                     implicitly contained in the latter complete description, it is not              at all obvious how to extract it.  The sophisticated machinery that             has been developed by topologists, such things as the                           investigations in homotopy theory outlined for this project, has                now been developed to a degree that often permits these natural                 problems to be handled in a natural way.",
