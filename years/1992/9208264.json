 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research would use an analysis of mitochondrial               DNA and proteins to study relationships among members of                        Cyprinodon variegatus complex of pupfishes.  The species of this                complex include one wide-ranging species (C. variegatus) that                   occurs from Massachusetts to Tampico, Mexico and in the West                    Indies from the Bahamas to Jamaica.  The remaining 20 species of                the complex occupy much smaller areas, primarily within the range               of C. variegatus or near the periphery of its range.  the primary               objectives are 1) to understand the major patterns of geographic                variation in the wide-ranging species, 2) to relate this                        variation to the evolutionary relationships of the geographically               more restricted species, and 3) to use the results to evaluate                  biogeographic hypotheses and modes of speciation for the complex.               Of special interest is the question of whether populations of the               wide-ranging species, C. variegatus, might be more closely                      related to other species than to populations of their own                       species.  If so, then the morphology of the wide-ranging species                is primitive for the complex and it comprises one or more cryptic               species.  The results will be important in future assessments of                faunal origins for regions of particular interest in                            biogeography; for example, the West Indies and the western coast                of the Gulf of Mexico.",
