Mr. Brautigam is examining the papers, correspondence, and notes                of the founding editors of Biometrika, to discern the way in                    which an ideologically charged core identity of a \"biometrician\"                was created.  He is using the analysis of archival materials to                 supplement and contrast an analysis of the icons, metaphors, and                historical narratives published in Biometrika, which attempted to               communicate that identity to its reader-contributors.  He is also               examining the notes of the founding editors which pertain                       specifically to articles published in the journal in order to                   reveal the ways in which the editorial policy of the journal                    created and enforced certain notions of the proper biometric                    \"subject.\"  This archival analysis compliments an analysis of the               presentation of the \"subjects\" (men, women, deviants, criminals,                geniuses, etc.) in the journal itself.",
