 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometry has been viewed by many mathematics educators as a                natural context in which to introduce students to higher-order                  mathematical thinking.  Results of the Phase I Small Business                   Innovation Research (SBIR) study establish the technical basis                  for a new educational software tool, The Geometer's Sketchpad,                  that has as its purpose the provision of a visual environment                   with dynamic constructions, allowing students to investigate                    geometric shapes and relationships in ways that have heretofore                 not been possible.  The research objectives of the Phase II                     research focus on (1) development and testing of prototype                      classroom materials; (2) development and testing of prototype                   software; (3) assessment of attitudes and achievement among                     various student populations using The Geometer's Sketchpad; and                 (5) making The Geometer's Sketchpad accessible to the broadest                  range of students.  The project will provide software for                       applications that include enhanced versions of the software,                    versions for other hardware platforms, foreign language versions,               and books and collections of sketches/scripts for secondary,                    elementary, and university audiences.",
