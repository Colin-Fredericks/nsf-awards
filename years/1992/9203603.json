 "awd_abstract_narration": "&r. John T. Fourkas has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship                  in Chemistry. Dr. Fourkas' doctoral degree was from Stanford                    University under the supervision of Professor Michael Fayer.                    Dr. Fourkas intends to continue research at The University of                   Texas/Austin under the sponsorship of Profesor Mark Berg. Dr.                   Fourkas' area of postdoctoral research will be in ultrafast                     condensed-phase dynamics.  He will build and use femtosecond                    laser systems and learn about optical coherence techniques.                     The postdoctoral experience will ultimately be applied to study                 the dynamics of liquids in constrained media such as zeolites,                  micelles and porous glasses.                                                    %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                    knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                    meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
