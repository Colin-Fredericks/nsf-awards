 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics  can be exciting.  It can be fun.  The modern                       world surrounds us with examples of its beauty.  Too often,                     however, these examples go unnoticed or unexplored.  This is                    one reason so few young Americans think of mathematics as a                     potential career path:  they do not realize how much                            mathematics is a part of their lives, or how much they use                      it -- often without knowing it|  The Maryland Science Center                    and the mathematics faculty of the George Washington                            University have teamed up to create The Language of                             Patterns, a mathematics exhibit that examines mathematics in                    modern life.  Through engaging interactive exhibit stations,                    The Language of Patterns invites visitors of all ages to                        discover the intricacy and wonder of modern mathematics.                                                                                                        Eschewing highly technical terminology, the exhibit focuses                     instead on fun and exploration.  Mounted by the Maryland                        Science Center in its Baltimore facility and in a traveling                     version that will be available to science and technology                        museums across the county, this exhibit represents a unique                     collaboration between academic and museum exhibition design                     experts.  More important, The Language of Patterns is an                        opportunity for visitors to rethink their relationship with                     modern mathematics, one of man's most significant -- and                        misunderstood -- achievements.",
