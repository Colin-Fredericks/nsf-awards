 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in              biophysics between Joachim Frank from the New York State                        Department of Health in Albany and Jean Lamy at the University                  of Tours.  The objective of their research is to develop a                      methodology for localizing binding sites of antibodies on                       immunocomplexes.  Specifically, they will work on mapping                       antigenic epitopes in A. Hemocyanin molecules.  The methodology                 involves using electron microscopy and three dimensional                        reconstruction techniques.  Dr. Frank and his group bring to this               collaboration innovative technology for image reconstruction.  The              Albany Lab has developed a large specialized software system for                three-dimension imaging of macromolecules and two-dimensional                   maps.  This is complemented by the French laboratory's extensive                experience in immunochemistry and protein chemistry of A.                       Hemocyanin.  In addition the project will benefit from their                    previous collaboration on three-dimensional reconstruction.                                                                                                     The use of this model system is of great interest to researchers in             macromolecular chemistry.  The proposed techniques will facilitate              the mapping of binding sites of macromolecules, which cannot be                 crystallized and are too large for conventional x-ray                           crystallography.  The knowledge gained from this project will be                beneficial to researchers in biochemistry and molecular biology.",
