 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary purpose of this doctoral dissertation improvement                   award is to explore the relationship between dietary specia                     lization and the structure of primate dentition and masticatory                 musculature.  Understanding the mechanics of mastication is a                   central issue of anthropological research for it allows a better                appreciation of the relationships of animals to their                           environments.  Additionally, such understanding can lead to                     clearer interpretations of the fossil record of primate and human               evolution; a record which often consists of teeth.                                                                                                              This study will test the relationships between form and function                of primate dentition by measuring bite forces at a variety of                   positions along the dental arcade in a number of primate taxa.                  Additionally, three-dimensional coordinate data will be collected               for numerous primates in order to determine the covariation among               biomechanically important dimensions.  Closely related species                  which differ in dietary specialization will be tested.  This will               allow the testing of hypotheses regarding the relationship of                   diet to anatomy.",
