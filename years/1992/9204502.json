 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most (perhaps all) 3-manifolds are geometric.  Geometric group             theory seeks to tie together combinatorial and geometric properties             of geometric isometry groups.  The theory is burgeoning at the                  hands of Gromov, Epstein, Thurston, Holt, Bestvina, Feighn, Mess,               Paterson, Gersten, Short, Shapiro, Parry, Floyd, Baumslag, Casson,              Brick, Stallings, a whole school of continental mathematicians,                 Cannon, and others.  The theory has produced the notions of                     automatic group, negatively curved group, complex of groups, almost             convex groups, combable groups, isoperimetric and isodiametric                  inequalities for groups.  Amid these many topics, Cannon, his                   students, and coworkers are currently concentrating on a cluster of             projects related to the existence of hyperbolic structures on 3-                manifolds.  Is the generic finitely presented group negatively                  curved, as claimed without explicit proof by Gromov?  Does every                negatively curved closed 3-manifold admit a Riemannian metric of                constant negative curvature?  Can negative curvature be recognized              algorithmically?  Can the space at infinity be recognized                       algorithmically?  Can potential constant curvature be recognized                algorithmically?  Cannon is using as the basis for these studies                his combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem developed during the                  previous projects, the related work by Parry, and the computer                  Programs of Epstein and his collaborators.                                           Groups are the appropriate algebraic structures for describing             the notion of symmetry with precision.  For this reason they play               an extensive role in geometry (and topology).  While the more usual             interaction between group theory and geometry is the use of                     algebraic computations involving groups to prove theorems about                 geometric objects possessing symmetry, there is a very significant              mathematical subdiscipline in which the roles are reversed and our              intuition about geometric objects assists us in conjecturing and                proving theorems about associated groups.  A fascinating recent                 development is the influence of the computer in all this.  Not only             is it the ubiquitous timesaver that everyone knows, enabling one to             undertake computations that would otherwise be too formidable, but              it has actually influenced the questions in geometric group theory              in a more fundamental way.  Certain classes of groups have been                 defined in terms of the types of hypothetical machines that would               be able to perform certain computations about them.  Real hardware              is not involved in this, and the same definitions could have been               conceived long ago, but they were not, for the existence of                     computing machines has influenced the way we look at the world, the             types of questions we ask about it, the kinds of properties that we             find interesting.",
