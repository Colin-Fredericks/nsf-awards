Awardees will come from a wide range                                  of scientific fields in the social and physical                                 sciences, and will work with counterparts in                                    India.  Funds from this grant are used for                                      travel expenses and costs related to the                                        scholars' research projects, and to pay for                                     stipends for awardees.  The ACC scientific                                      committees select nominees for submission to                                    NSF, which makes final technical evaluation of                                  the awardees.  Past participants have been                                      engaged primarily in social and behavioral                                      sciences, with some in geological and few in                                    physical sciences.  Part of the award funds                                     supports the ACC administrative work.                                                                                                                           Scope:  Collaborative work by Indian and Indian                                 scientists is demonstrated in this project.                                     The ACC representative office in India obtains                                  the necessary clearances for the U.S.                                           scientists to be affiliated with various Indian                                 academic and research institutions.  They also                                  manage the logistics of travel of each                                          scientist, his/her family when appropriate,                                     shipping of research material into and out of                                   India, as well as language training, and                                        assisting with research arrangements.   The                                     project fits well with the objectives of the                                    U.S.-India Program.",
