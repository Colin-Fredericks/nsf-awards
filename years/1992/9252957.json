 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's goal is to investigate mechanisms which may                produce gas phase chlorine atoms from sea salt aerosols--a                      problem in atmospheric chemistry with a unique approach made                    possible by the combination of expertise of the PI and her                      collaborators at Harvard.  Four potentially important reactions will            be investigated, applying two different experimental approaches to              the study of these surface reactions.  The first approach will                  involve studying candidate reactions, using large surface                       area/bulk surfaces that may be investigated at relatively high                  pressures.  The second approach toward understanding these                      reactions and their mechanisms will involve studies of well                     characterized single crystal surfaces at low pressure, using state-             of-the-art surface science spectroscopic techniques.  Despite its               advantages, this latter approach has not been exploited in                      investigations of surface reactions of atmospheric relevance.  A                series of systematic studies outlined in the proposal are designed              to determine the role of each of four reactions in producing gas                phase chlorine atoms from sea salt aerosols.  The impact of these               reactions on the chemistry of the troposphere will be determined                using a comprehensive theoretical model of tropospheric                         chemistry.                                                                            Understanding mechanisms which may produce gas phase                      chlorine atoms from sea salt aerosols could greatly impact our                  understanding of tropospheric chemistry and the basis for                       important societal decisions such as the design of pollution                    controls and formulation of safe alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons            (which are responsible for dramatic losses of ozone in the                      Antarctic).                                                                           This project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                   opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    organizing and sponsoring a mentoring program for graduate and                  undergraduate women in the sciences and engineering;                            organizing a lunch time symposium featuring women active in                     science and engineering;  developing and delivering a series of                 lectures geared for undergraduates on topics of current interest to             the chemical community; delivering a departmental seminar on the                research results obtained during the year; and interacting with                 faculty and students while pursuing the goals of the research                   project.",
