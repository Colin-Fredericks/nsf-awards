 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pseudomonas solanacearum is an ecologically and economically                    important phytopathogen causing a lethal wilt disease of over 200               solanaceous plants worldwide.  The research proposed investigates               biochemical and genetic basis of its pathogenicity, focusing on                 major extracellular macromolecules.  A greater than 10-kb segment               (Region I) of the P. solanacearum genome in which insertions                    simultaneously cause a major decrease in virulence, production of               extracellular polysaccharide slime (EPS), and synthesis of two                  major extracellular proteins (EXPs) has been identified.  One                   objective of the proposed research is to characterize Region I gene             products and investigate their involvement in virulence and                     synthesis of extracellular virulence molecules.  This will be                   accomplished by E. coli maxicell analysis of Region I subclones,                TnphoA mutagenesis, and in vitro biochemical and in planta studies              of nonpolar isertion mutants of Region I.  The gene encoding a                  major 28-kDa EXP, whose level correlates with EPS levels, will be               cloned and similarly analyzed.  For the biochemical studies we will             first develop methods to detect accumulation of intermediates in                EPS synthesis.  Expression of Region I depends on two distinct,                 unlinked loci that encode exported (membrane) proteins, and a locus             located 6 kb downstream of Region I; other studies suggest that all             these loci control other virulence genes unlinked to Region I.                  Additional project objectives are characterization of the                       regulatory proteins by DNA sequence and gene product analysis,                  exploring crosstalk between them by analysis of Region I expression             in multiple mutant background, and investigation of signals                     affecting virulence gene regulation.",
