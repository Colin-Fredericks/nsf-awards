 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most efforts to enable concurrent engineering to date have                 focused on developing the tools and techniques for designing                    completely new products.  Design in many industries is                          volutionary, consisting primarily of incremental changes to                     existing products.  This category of design is the target of direct             engineering, which is concerned with giving engineers direct access             to complete knowledge about the design and manufacture of a part                as the part is being designed.  Direct engineering differs from                 concurrent engineering in that this knowledge is not generated at               design time, but is retrieved from an engineering database which                completely documents existing designs.                                               The project focuses on developing the key enabling component               of direct engineering, the engineering design component for a                   specific product, and an automobile crankshaft.  During a summer                internship at a major automobile manufacturer, the principal                    investigator will work with the co-investigator and other key                   personnel to identify the critical crankshaft design variables and              their relationships to functional issues, manufacturing,                        prototyping, fixture design, tooling, dunnage, etc.  After                      completely documenting these relationships for the crankshaft, an               appropriate constraint-based product representation will be                     developed.  The second stage of the work will result in a prototype             computer implementation of the product model to illustrate the                  concept of direct engineering for automotive crankshafts.",
