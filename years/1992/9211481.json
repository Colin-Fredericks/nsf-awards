 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project considers the estimation of motion in a time-varying               image sequence, and its applications in video compression.  The                 proposed approaches are based on a transform domain motion                      representation which describes the spatial displacement field of                a moving object by a set of transform coefficients, each specifying             the contribution of a basic motion to the apparent motion.  The                 difficulty with using such an object-oriented motion representation             for images containing multiple objects with mixed motions is                    countered by a joint motion estimation and object segmentation                  procedure in a multi-resolution quad-tree structure.  The proposed              project consists of two parts.  The first part includes theoretic               and algorithmic investigation on, 1) viable motion transform bases,             2) transform domain motion estimation, 3) hierarchical, joint                   motion estimation and object segmentation, and 4) motion                        compensated temporal interpolation.  The second part encompasses                the studies on low bit rate object oriented video coding using the              techniques produced in the first part.                                                                                                                          Results from the first part will contribute to the theory of image              sequence processing and analysis, and will provide new solutions                to several key elements in video signal processing and three                    dimensional scene analysis and object tracking.  The success of the             second part, in particular, will suggest new alternatives to low                bit rate video coding which is indispensable for video coding over              narrow band channels and video database applications.",
