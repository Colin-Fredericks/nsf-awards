This is the                                                first such meeting to be sponsored                                              by the Optical Society of America;                                              its purpose is to bring together a                                              diverse group of researchers, both                                              experimentalists and theorists, to                                              discuss their work in the area of                                               surface roughness and scattering.                                               The meeting will be held                                                        concurrently with the Topical                                                   Conference on Interference Coatings,                                            and will include a joint session to                                             discuss roughness and scattering in                                             optical coatings.  New fabrication                                              techniques will be discussed, such                                              as methods for achieving supersmooth                                            surface finish and precision                                                    grinding to achieve final shape and                                             finish, which are critical                                                      requirements for mirrors uses in the                                            vacuum ultraviolet and x-ray                                                    spectral regions.  Characterization                                             techniques needed to measure shape,                                             surface finish characteristics,                                                 chemical composition and other                                                  properties will be discussed, where                                             emphasis will be on development of                                              new instrument designs for                                                      specialized measurements.  This will                                            provide opportunities for                                                       interactions between instrument                                                 designers, manufacturers and users.                                             One such example that will be                                                   discussed is the atomic force                                                   microscope and its application to                                               surfaces.  A specialized panel will                                             be held to discuss requirements for                                             statistical analysis of surfaces for                                            various industries needs such as in                                             semiconductor, optical and other                                                commercial industries, including                                                automobiles, that rely on high                                                  quality surface finishes.",
