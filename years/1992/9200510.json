 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Iowa has a two year REU site in the Department                of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering.  Students are matched with             one of six faculty advisors that conduct research in an area most               closely related to their interests.  The individual projects are                in research areas of expertise of the supervising REU faculty to                ensure direct scientific interaction between the REU students and               graduate students of each research group.  A close student-faculty              interaction will be developed during daily discussions about the                progress of the particular project and other research related                   issues.  In addition, weekly seminars on research-related issues                and many social events will be held.  The summer's program will                 conclude with an \"in-house\" research conference during which the                REU students will present their research results.  It is expected               that significant guidance by the REU advisor will be necessary                  during the early stages of the research.  All of these programs and             activities are planned to achieve the goal of making                            underrepresented groups more aware of graduate research                         opportunities in chemical and biochemical engineering to increase               the number of minorities and women pursuing advanced engineering                degrees.",
