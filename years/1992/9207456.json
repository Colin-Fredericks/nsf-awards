 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to continue the development                of new statistical tools and methods that address real issues of                concern in empirical social science research.  The primary focus                of the prior work was on multiple imputation technology,  which                 includes a family of techniques dealing with incomplete data.                   These techniques have been used increasingly by government agencies             such as the Census Bureau and the Internal Revenue Service.                     Applications also have grown in academic research on a wide range               of topics.  Incompleteness,  in fact,  pervades intensively used                scientific data as far ranging as social surveys and clinical                   medical protocols.                                                                                                                                                    Four main areas are addressed in the proposed research.                   First,  continuing efforts will be made to hone the tools for                   multiple imputation.  Second,  modern methods of statistical                    computation such as extensions of the EM algorithm and the Gibbs                sampler,  will continue to be pursued.  Third,  the foundations of              causal inference and practical methods for drawing causal                       inferences in observational studies will be further developed.  And             fourth,  a variety of other techniques relevant to social science               research,  such as meta-analysis and mixture modelling,  will be                explored.                                                                                                                                                             The principal investigator's statistical contributions in the             broad areas covered by this project have been impressive both in                depth and volume.  In addition,  the many students he has trained               in this long-term research agenda are superbly equipped to                      disseminate the results and to join in advancing the state of the               art.  The prospect of his achieving further significant                         accomplishments is very high.",
