 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program,                  Professor Ziegler is developing and using novel Raman                           spectroscopic techniques to investigate the dynamics of                         photodissociation processes in small polyatomic molecules at a                  resolution sufficient to examine individual rotational-                         vibrational levels.  Previously developed rotational resonance                  Raman techniques are being used to measure rovibrational                        quantum specific lifetimes of short-lived (20 femtoseconds to 5                 picoseconds) quasi-bound excited state levels.  Resonance                       hyper-Raman is extending the work to dissociative molecular                     excited states in the vuv accessible via two-photon processes                   with near-uv photons.  Planned work also includes the use of                    resonant Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) to                      achieve greater rotational quantum resolution and allow the                     study of larger molecules.                                                      %%%                                                                             In order to control and predict the course of chemical                          reactions, one must understand the dynamics of reactions on a                   molecular level as a function of both space and time.  This                     experimental and theoretical study will focus on expanding our                  detailed understanding of the process of photodissociation,                     that is, the breaking apart of a molecule after the absorption                  of light.  In this work the photodissociation process will be                   examined in several cases for the dependence of the outcome on                  the initial energy state of the absorbing species.",
