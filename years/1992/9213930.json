 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project measures the systematic differences in the                         intertemporal allocation of consumption chosen by rich and the                  poor consumers and the impact that those differences have on the                intertemporal allocation of aggregate consumption.  The results                 of this research could provide important new insights into the                  reasons why countries differ in economic growth rates, aggregate                consumption and savings.                                                                                                                                        Previous work by the investigators demonstrates that systematic                 differences in the attitudes of the rich and the poor toward the                allocation of their consumption expenditure over time can lead to               significant effects of the level and cross-sectional distribution               of consumption on aggregate consumption growth and saving.                      This project studies wealth based variation in the intertemporal                allocation of consumption caused by differences in preferences                  and market imperfections.  The research on differences in                       preferences is a continuation of work by the investigators on                   measuring the aggregate impact of differences in the                            intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) across poor and                  rich consumers.  The previous work assumed complete markets.                    This project investigates whether or not preference parameters                  estimated and estimates of the aggregate IES under the complete                 market assumption is severely biased by simulating data from an                 economy with borrowing constraints.  Both differences in                        preferences and incompleteness of markets are incorporated into                 the theoretical analysis.  The project distinguished empirically                between different models of incomplete markets by testing whether               the idiosyncratic impact of unemployment and illness on                         consumption is temporary or permanent.",
