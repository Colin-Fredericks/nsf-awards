 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is the intent of this project to help prepare scientifically                 literate citizens by improving the scientific education of non-                 science majors (with a specific focus on elementary education                   majors) enrolled in an introductory physics course (Physics                     100).  A Laboratory/Lecture format for this course is already                   in place which encourages students to learn physics first by                    doing experiments and then developing these concepts through                    lectures and discussions.  To address the difficulty that many                  of these students are not particularly adept at using                           mathematics, the general pattern recognition required to move                   from the concrete experiment to the abstract principle is                       developed through graphing.  This approach has been well                        accepted; however there are two difficulties: 1) graphing                       significant amounts of data can become tedious, causing                         students to become weary of the process and the science                         involved;  and 2) gathering sufficient data to gain insight                     into systems through the use of the scientific method can be                    extremely time consuming.  These two difficulties can be                        overcome by computerizing the laboratory.  Data can be plotted                  and revised expeditiously using a computer.  Using probes                       interfaced to the computer, significant amounts of data can be                  collected rapidly.  These data can then be easily plotted.                      Thus, greater emphasis can be placed on the science with less                   energy expended on technical details.  More time can be spent                   discerning the patterns of nature and exploring their                           implications.",
