 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concomitant with the decline of established manufacturing                  regions in the U.S. has been a rise in both output and employment               in service industries.  Of these producer services, the financial               service industries have undergone substantial change as a result                of intensified competition, domestic deregulation, and technical                change.  Financial services are important employers, and they                   influence the competitiveness of most other industries by virtue                of their control over the money supply and the credit system.  As               world financial markets have become more international, the                     coordination and control of financial flows is concentrating in a               few select centers of banking and commercial capital.  After                    London, Tokyo, and New York, Los Angeles has risen to a position                as the financial center of the west coast in terms of employment,               assets, deposits, and loan activity.  This research investigates                how the restructuring of financial services since 1970 has                      affected the demand for, and the composition of, labor in Los                   Angeles.  The research will link changes in forms of competition                and regulation, technical change, and industrial organization                   with changing employment strategies in commercial banking.                      Analysis of secondary data will be complemented by semi-                        structured interviews with senior bank management in order to                   establish how commercial banks reorganize their internal and                    external operations to remain competitive, to uncover the                       strategies they use to restructure labor and lower costs, and to                determine whether restructuring affects different labor pools in                terms of wages, hours worked, turnover, and job security.                            An examination of changing employment practices in                         commercial banking will extent an understanding of how industrial               restructuring affects different groups of labor.  It will also                  inform broader theoretical and policy debates about the growth of               tertiary employment in the face of a decline in manufacturing                   employment in U.S. cities.",
