 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protecting groups are a vital tool in the synthesis of                          multifunctional molecules such as valuable third                                generation pharmaceuticals.  When a reaction must be                            carried out at a specific reaction site, protecting groups                      are often used to temporarily block other sensitive                             reaction sites on the molecule.  Substituted benzyl                             alcohols are particularly useful as protecting groups.                          They are prepared by reacting electrophiles with a simple                       derivative of benzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol ester.                             Although this reaction proceeds in excellent yield, it                          results in a mixture of isomers with similar physical                           properties.  Separation of the isomers is                                       expensive and technically difficult.                                                                                                                            This project is focused on the continued investigation of                       a novel membrane-based process to address the above                             problem.  The process couples a selective catalyzed                             reaction with membrane-based separation.  Each reaction                         product is a commercially important protecting group in                         pharmaceutical                                                                  synthesis.",
