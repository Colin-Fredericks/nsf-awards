 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcification is an extremely widespread phenomenon occurring in                organisms as diverse as bacteria, plants, sponges, clams and                    humans. Among the invertebrates, there are calcified structures                 that cover or encase their bodies such as coral reefs, snail                    shells, crab exoskeletons and sea urchin tests and spines. Other                invertebrates form numerous usually microscopic calcified                       structures that impregnate the body called spicules or ossicles.                The octocoral or sea whip Leptogorgia virgulata is an excellent                 example of an animal possessing elaborate spicules throughout its               body. Like most invertebrate calcified structures, these spicules               contain an internal organic matrix that provides a framework for                the deposition of calcium carbonate. What is unusual, however, is               our discovery that this octocoral spicule matrix contains collagen,             a protein that is critical in the formation of bones and teeth, but             is rarely associated with invertebrate calcium carbonate structure.             Furthermore, this octocoral collagen varies seasonally, being                   predominant in the summer. This three-year project will explore in              depth the relationships between octocoral spicule calcification                 over time will be studied using a variety of specific markers. For              example, tetracycline is a fluorescent marker and 45Ca is a                     radioactive calcification. Radiolabelled proline and specific                   antibody markers that we have recently developed, mark collagen                 synthesis. These components can be visualized through fluorescence              and transmission electron microscopy, and measured by quantifying               the amount of label present. Bone remodelling involves changes in               acidity and enzyme spicules using enzymatic reactions and other                 specific antibody markers. An important dimension of this project               is the involvement of student investigators.",
