 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of stereochemical control of free radical                      addition processes will be conducted. The overall goal of the                   research is to define the mechanism of free radical addition                    processes which results in exact control of the stereochemistry                 of the final products generated. Reactions to be investigated                   during the course of this project include radical additions,                    atom transfer, and polymerizations of alkenes bearing amide                     auxiliaries. Precise regulation of the tacticity of                             specifically engineered oligomers and polymers will be                          accomplished by use of very specific stereochemical reactions.                  The exact distribution of oligomers will be regulated by                        reactions in micellar environments designed to produce a                        discrete number of reaction steps. In addition, the chemistry                   of peroxyl radical rearrangement and cyclization reactions will                 be investigated by the use of stereochemical probes and oxygen                  isotopes.                                                                       %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor N. A. Porter at Duke University.                   The studies will center around efforts to engineer the exact                    structure of molecules by extremely efficient and selective                     free radical reactions. By forcing chemical reactions to take                   place in very specific pathways, it is possible to generate                     molecules that are designed to solve important problems by                      virtue of their carefully controlled structure. One of the                      final goals of this work is to make molecules which have many                   repeat units of exactly the same orientation in space. This                     will result in molecules with very unusual properties.",
