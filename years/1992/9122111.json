 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the                      Chemistry Division is sponsoring research by Professor Jelski                   into the nature of silicon, germanium, and carbon clusters                      surrounded by other media.  Prediction of electronic structure,                 and properties of the clusters embedded in bulk material                        simulates realistic experimental situations.  The work makes                    use of an Extended Huckel tight-binding model.                                  Parameterization of the method by ab initio techniques will                     permit the method to be extended to germanium.  The work                        involves close collaboration with the research group of Dr.                     Rantala in Oulu, Finland.                                                       %%%                                                                             A very active field of current research, both experimental and                  theoretical, deals with small clusters of atoms which have                      properties and behavior linking gas-phase molecules, for which                  very extensive knowledge is available, to the much more                         difficult problem of condensed phase matter.  There are also                    potential significance in the production of extremely small                     electronic devices.   Professor Jelski is using a                               semi-empirical method to study clusters of silicon, germanium,                  or carbon atoms in contact with other media, a realistic                        situation for practical devices.",
