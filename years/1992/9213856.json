 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation is part of GLOBEC - Global Ocean Ecosystems                  Dynamics - of the U.S. Global Chenage Research Program.  It is                  aimed at quantification of the interrelation between plankton                   trophodynamics and turbulence.  This project stems form the fact                that the literature assumes that trophodynamics and consequent                  population dynamics depend only on the relative density of                      predator and prey organisms, yet growing theoretical and                        empirical evidence indicates that turbulence can be alter the                   contact rate.  Using a supercomputer, turbulence can be simulated               directly from the Navier-Stokes equation (DNS) so the simulated                 field is a \"real\" flow.  Flow visualization at the scale of an                  individual planktonic organism is the best way to educate our                   scientific mind.  Accumulated oceanic turbulence measurements                   provide enough information to interpret the numerically simulated               turbulence as oceanic turbulent flow.  A lognormal probability                  density function will be used to model the statistics of                        turbulent flow around a planktonic organism.                                                                                                                    A computer program will be developed to reduce the amount of                    computation required for DNS.  This program will create a                       kinematically correct random flow field at a high Reynolds                      number, which is unavailable from DNS.  A data base will be                     established for the simulated flow field for later uses.  A                     potential use of this data base will be to test the notion of                   food/ingestion signals.                                                                                                                                         A stochastic model will be employed to model the behavior of a                  planktonic organism.  Currently random walk is the only model                   used in Lagrangian simulations, however, the organism shows much                more complex swimming behavior.  A modified Auto-Regressive model               will be adapted for this purpose.",
