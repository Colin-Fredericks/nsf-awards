 "awd_abstract_narration": "Issues of openness, secrecy, authorship, and intellectual property              remain of central concern in scientific and technical research.                 The current debate between the French and Americans over the                    discovery of the HIV virus or the criticism of classified CIA-                  supported research at the Rochester Institute of Technology are                 just two of many examples of conflicts that can arise concerning                these issues.  The creation of an office of scientific integrity                at the NIH and an Inspector General's Office at NSF are                         manifestations of the importance government has attached to these               questions.  Yet these are not in any sense new problems.  Under                 this grant, Dr. Long is continuing her investigation of the origins             of beliefs and attitudes towards openness, secrecy, authorship and              intellectual property in the period before the rise of modern                   science and technology in the scientific revolution.  She argues                that the most important sources for these attitudes and beliefs                 consist of practical, technical and military writings and craft                 guild documents.                                                                                                                                                In this study, Dr. Long is evaluating the ways in which prior                   traditions of practical authorship influenced the development of                an ideal of openness in the new experimental science.  At the same              time, however, she has found a rising interest in secrecy,                      priority, intellectual property, patents and privileges.  She is                examining the conflicts that emerged from these competing                       interests.  Her study concludes with an analysis of the ways in                 which scientific methodology was influenced by such issues as they              had been elaborated in prior practical traditions.  This research               promises to enrich our understanding of the bases for contemporary              debate over these issues.",
