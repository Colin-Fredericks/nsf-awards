The researchers will study the                                interconnected brain nuclei responsible for song                                acquisition and production in order to determine how song                       system nuclei differ between species or whether variation                       in anatomy between species is systematically related to                         differences in song.  Results should contribute to our                          fundamental understanding of the relationship of brain and                      behavior by drawing upon complementing strengths in                             evolutionary biology and neurobiology.  Funds for the                           project are awarded through the US-Hungary Joint Fund,                          Budapest, in accordance with established guidelines.                                                                                                            This project in zoology fulfills the program objective of                       advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts                      in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                              complementary talents and pool resources in areas of                            strong mutual interest and competence.",
