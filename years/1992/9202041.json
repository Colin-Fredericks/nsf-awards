 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will continue his study of elliptic genera                and elliptic cohomology.  A new family of periodic cohomology                   theories was found in 1986 in joint work with Douglas Ravenel and               Robert Stong; it is the intention to study the central problem of               determining the intrinsic geometric nature of these cohomology                  theories, in light of the recent work on constructing elliptic                  homology by M. Kreck, S. Stolz, and M. Hovey.  Further problems                 dealing with variants of the usual level-2 elliptic genus, yielding             level-1 modular forms related to the Thom spectrum MO<8>, and level             N (N > 1) modular forms related to Jacobi polynomials, will be                  studied.  In addition, it is hoped that connections can be                      established linking knot invariants and quantum groups to elliptic              cohomology.                                                                          This project is concerned with reducing geometric information              to a subject for calculation.  The nature of the geometric                      information involved is the crux of the problem.  While questions               about lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry               out to be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what                are known as topological properties of geometric objects.  These                are properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),                  knottedness, having no holes, and so forth.  All systematic study               of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric              objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are              only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of                 differences that can occur, all these have only truly been                      comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of             calculation.  Modern algebra furnishes many of the tools and the                attitudes toward the tools that are needed, and the interplay                   between the algebra and the topology remains a fascinating subject.             Elliptic cohomology, invented by the investigator and several co-               workers, bids fair to be one of the important tools in the arsenal              available to algebraic topologists.",
