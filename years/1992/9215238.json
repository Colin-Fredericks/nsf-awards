 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nervous system of multicellular organisms is a complex network              of diverse cell types with unique positions and patterns of                     connectivity.  Understanding how these cellular phenotypes develop              from these intricate patterns is a central problem in cell and                  developmental biology.  The Drosophila compound eye is well suited              for studying these processes.  The research is aimed at                         understanding the cellular interactions involved in pattern                     formation in the developing eye, specifically the role of                       photoreceptor cell R8 which is thought to play a central role in                these events.  The investigators have recently identified a new                 genetic locus rap (retina aberrant in pattern) whose functions are              critical for pattern formation in eye.  Studies with a temperature              sensitive mutant have shown that rap function is essential during               pattern formation and preliminary immunocytological studies                     indicate that rap gene function is involved in early events during              pattern formation.  In addition, genetic mosaic studies show that               rap gene function is required only in the photoreceptor cell R8 for             normal eye pattern formation.  The research is aimed at a genetic               and molecular analysis of the rap gene with a view to understanding             the molecular nature of the rap gene product and its expression                 patterns.  Furthermore, the genetic interactions that are important             for rap function will be identified.  These studies will facilitate             an understanding of the nature of cellular interactions underlying              neural pattern formation.",
