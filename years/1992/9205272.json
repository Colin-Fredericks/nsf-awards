 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused toward increasing our understanding of               the role(s) played by virally-encoded movement proteins (MP) in                 facilitating the transport of viral RNA between cells of the                    infected host plant.  The research plan calls for the generation of             a series of chimeric MPs, produced by genetic recombination of                  distantly-related tobamoviruses, in an effort to determine which                protein motifs affect virulence, host specificity, and                          intercellular transport.  The plan will also involve the expression             and study of MP from sunn-hemp mosaic virus (SHMV) in transgenic                plants to determine its effects on plasmodesmatal structure and                 sieving properties.  Finally, photochemical crosslinking studies                will be performed on inoculated protoplasts, to assess MP binding               to RNA during infection and/or transport.                                       %%%                                                                                A major facet of the viral infection of host plants involves the             intercellular movement of viral nucleic acids through                           plasmodesmata.  This transport is facilitated by a series of viral              proteins known collectively as the movement proteins.  The                      generation of chimeric movement proteins is a creative approach to              assess their specificity and function.  This work will provide                  significant, new information on an important problem in plant                   pathology.",
