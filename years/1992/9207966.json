 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many realistic image synthesis algorithms have been proposed                    in the last few years, but unfortunately they tend to be very                   inefficient, often requiring hours or days of calculations.                     As a result, the visual cues provided by these algorithms                       (shading, shadows,  transparency, reflections, etc.)  still                     have not been used routinely by applications requiring                          visualization.  This project is concerned with development of                   efficient image synthesis algorithms based on the integral                      equation representing light transport in the environment.  It                   used techniques recently developed to solve the N-body problem                  in linear time.  Preliminary results indicate that the                          interaction matrix corresponding to the integral equation with                  a linear number of blocks can be approximated.  Since this                      approximation has linear-space complexity, it makes it                          possible to explore solution techniques that have been                          previously too time and memory intensive to consider.  It also                  studies visibility problems, sampling and meshing problems,                     and lazy evaluation strategies within the context of solving                    the light transport equation.  Finally, these ideas will be                     implemented and tested.  The long range goal of all this                        research is to develop robust and practical algorithms that                     can be incorporated into 3D graphics workstations of the                        future.",
