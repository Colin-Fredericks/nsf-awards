 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists, engineers, humanities scholars and social scientists                from the Acadia Institute, California Institute of Technology,                  Dartmouth College, Illinois Insititue of Technology, Loyola                     University-Chicago, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are               forming a two-year consortium to create teaching materials to                   teach academic research ethics to graduate students of science                  and engineering.  The consortium includes a team of two from each               institution, and will create at least six modules on specific                   topics in research ethics.  The modules, paperbound books                       consisting of 100 to 125 pages, will address such issues as                     research methodology, professional honesty, reporting on                        research, whistleblowing and loyalty, and animals and human                     subjects in research.  Each module will contain reprints, cases,                analyses, appropriate federal and professional guidelines and                   bibliographies.  Authorship for each module will be                             interdisciplinary and inter-campus, and the content will benefit                from the uniquely collaborative approach of this project.  During               the grant period, each campus team will facilitate a seminar on                 research ethics.  The seminars will include faculty members,                    post-doctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students.                     Seminar participants will evaluate modules in progress.                         Ultimately, the modules will be published as a series through                   University Press of New England and offered individually to                     scientific and engineering professional societies.",
