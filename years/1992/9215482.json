 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to investigate and develop                         techniques needed to produce a tool that allows the                             applications programmer and computer designer to work closely                   to increase uniprocessor performance.  Computational units,                     such as the floating-point units, are becoming faster and                       readily available because of the rapid advances in technology                   and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools.  The performance,                        however, is limited by the rate at which data is applied to                     the units.  To achieve good uniprocessor performance, one must                  efficiently utilize the computational units, memory, and                        memory ports.  This may require that the applications                           programmer redesign the algorithms to better exploit the                        unique features of the architecture or the computer designer                    utilize CAD tools to design special-purpose processors that                     exploit the unique features of the algorithms or for best                       results, both.  This research will investigate and develop (1)                  techniques for extracting statistics on the utilization of the                  aforementioned processor resources and (2) methods for                          displaying the performance statistics to benefit both the                       applications programmer and the computer designer.  The                         results of this research will permit the applications                           programmer and computer designer to interact closely to                         address the problem of efficiently solving challenging                          problems such as climate modeling, vehicle dynamics,                            semiconductor modeling, and quantum chromodynamics, which are                   beyond the scope of existing computers.",
