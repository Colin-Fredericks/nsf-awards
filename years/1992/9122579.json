 "awd_abstract_narration": "Herbivores confront a food resource base with a complex                    assortment of nutrients and toxins.  Because of this complexity,                                                                                                diet selection in herbivores is poorly understood.  Pikas                       (Ochotona princeps) are mammals (related to rabbits) that inhabit                                                                                               mountainous regions and unlike many other small mammals, remain                 active all winter. During the winter, pikas survive on stored                   vegetation (\"haypiles\"), collected during the previous summer.                  The winter diet stored in the haypile differs considerably from                 the plants that pikas consume in the summer, although both are                  collected simultaneously.  This project focuses on identifying                  the factors responsible for these different diet choices.                            Hypotheses that 1) pikas select their summer diet to be                    nutrient-rich and toxin-poor, but that their winter diet choice                 is more intricate than simple avoidance of plant toxins; and that                                                                                               2) pikas manipulate plant toxins in their winter diet, will be                  tested.  Data on nutrients, toxins, and morphologies of available                                                                                               food plants will be collected and used to test these hypotheses.                                                                                                     The significance of the research extends beyond                                                                                                            understanding the question of diet selection in pikas.                                                                                                          Identifying the factors governing diet selection, may lead to                                                                                                   better diets for herbivorous animals in zoos.  Moreover, this                                                                                                   information could be used to exploit plant toxins to naturally                                                                                                  regulate herbivorous pest populations, especially rodents.",
