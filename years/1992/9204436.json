 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is an experimental study of adsorption and                        diffusion of proteins within the interstitial spaces of a                       chromatographic resin.  The primary focus of this study is the                  measurement of the diffusion coefficients and adsorption rate                   constants in resins by an NMR technique.  This technique was                    first pioneered by the PIs using the protein hen egg white                      lysozyme.  This enzyme was labelled with a fluorine spin                        label, dissolved in a medium without adsorbing boundaries, and                  subject to an rf pulse.  Equations are written for the                          evolution of the transverse and longitudinal magnetization                      imparted by the pulse.  From these equations, the magnitudes                    of the refocussable magnetization can be obtained as a                          function of the tracer diffusion coefficient; comparisons with                  the measured values of the magnetization allows for the                         computation of the diffusion coefficient.  The proposal                         presents a novel idea for the measurement of adsorption.  The                   PIs argue that when the decay rate of the transverse                            magnetization of the protein in the fluid is much smaller than                  that for the protein on the surface, and the characteristic                     time for adsorption is much longer than the time for                            relaxation of the transverse magnetization of adsorbed                          species, the equation which governs the refocussable                            magnetization is identical to that for relaxation in a                          nonadsorbing medium, with adsorption renormalizing a                            coefficient.  They suggest first using this technique to                        obtain the diffusion coefficient, and then using a simulated                    echo, in which longitudinal relaxation governs much of the                      response, to measure the adsorption coefficient.  Adsorption                    is not lumped in the dynamic equations for the longitudinal                     decay because the scale for longitudinal relaxation decay on                    the surface is of the order of that in the bulk.  The proposed                  research will examine experimentally adsorption and diffusion                   in new adsorbent materials, particularly size excluded resins                   with small pores in order to determine the effects of hindered                  diffusion, and then in ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction                    and reversed phase systems.  These materials will be studied                    with a view towards end-use applications in perfusion                           chromatography.                                                                                                                                                 In a second part of the study, protein molecules will be                        tagged with paramagnetic ions by means of chelators in order                    to render the aqueous protons dependent on the local protein                    concentration.  The PIs intend to calibrate this effect, and                    use it to measure concentration profiles in the interstitial                    space.  In a third and final part of the study, modeling                        efforts will be directed at prediction of diffusion and                         adsorption including the effects of pore size distribution,                     adsorption kinetics, and high loading.  Separate theoretical                    efforts will focus on instabilities at miscible displacement                    fronts.",
