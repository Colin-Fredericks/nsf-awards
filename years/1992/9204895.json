 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development and evolution of the nematode male tail fan will be                 studied. The long term objective is to reconstruct the                          evolutionary pathway that has historically been followed to lead                to diverse nematode forms. The aim is to identify and describe in               molecular terms the genetic events that underlie the evolution of               developmental programs. Evolution of the tail fan developmental                 program will be studied by comparing the cellular mechanisms of                 fan development in C. elegans with that in four other free living               nematode species. The fan is chosen for these studies because its               morphology varies widely among nematode species. Cells                          responsible for making the fan will be identified by cell                       ablation experiments in C. elegans. Development of the fan will                 be studied by tracing cell lineages, defining the positions of                  epidermal cells by indirect immunofluorescence staining with a                  monoclonal antibody to a cell junctional antigen, and by direct                 light microscopic observation. Points of evolutionary divergence                will be identified in the various stages of fan differentiation.                A phylogenetic tree indicating the evolutionary relationships of                the nematode species studies will be constructed from sequences                 of the small ribosomal subunit genes. In order to identify genes                that may have played a role in evolution of the fan, mutants of                 C. elegans with abnormal fans will be analyzed. Existing                        mutations will be genetically mapped to place them into genes.                  Phenotypes of the mutations will be described following the same                criteria used to compare the different species. In this way, it                 is hoped to identify genes acting at the same developmental                     stages where evolutionary divergence has occurred.",
