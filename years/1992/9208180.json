 "awd_abstract_narration": "Greenleaf will apply the theory of group representations to                problems in mathematical analysis on nilpotent Lie groups and                   their quotient spaces.  These investigations will seek a                        description of the algebra of invariant differential operators in               terms of the coadjoint orbits in the dual of the Lie algebra of                 the group.  Initial efforts will address a basic conjecture:  The               invariant differential operators on the quotient form a                         commutative algebra precisely when the quasi-regular                            representation has finite multiplicities.  Success in these                     investigations will lead to understanding of solvability, and                   existence of fundamental solutions, for invariant differential                  operators.                                                                           The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                   twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                 exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                             representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                   upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                    theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                        mechanics and elementary particle physics.",
