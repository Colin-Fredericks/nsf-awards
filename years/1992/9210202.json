 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the dynamics of organizational                          concentration over time.  A highly concentrated organizational                  population is one which is dominated by a few very large                        organizations while low concentration is defined as a population                of organizations with many small units.  This study will examine                the effects of founding, failure, and growth rates on changes in                concentration over time.  The study will employ event history                   models to analyze data the founding, growth, and decline of life                insurance companies in New York and Arizona.                                         One of the major contributions of this study will be to                    further our understanding of the social and economic processes                  leading to the development of monopolies in some industries,                    while others are characterized by many small organizations or                   firms.  Another contribution will be to show directly how the                   engine of change in the size distribution of organizations                      consist of organizational creation, failure, and growth rates.",
