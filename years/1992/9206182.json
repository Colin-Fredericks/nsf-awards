 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores a new hypothesis for explaining the patterns              of mating in pelagically-spawning marine fish.  The hypothesis                  states that spawning sites and times are selected to improve                    fertilization rates.  In general, spawning periods represent                    critical times for production and vulnerable times for harvesting.              It is important to know more about their causal basis.  In the                  bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatu, Dr. Petersen and colleagues             found that the timing of mating varies dramatically between local               populations, the mean fertilization rates were surprisingly low and             appeared to be influenced by turbulence and location on the reef,               and the number of sperm released by males correlated significantly              with the size and fecundity of the female with whom they are                    mating.  This project will conduct three interrelated                           investigations:  (1) determine timing of mating by examining the                relationships between several measures of water movement and the                time of spawning on reefs with different schedules; (2) locate                  mating sites that facilitate fertilization, egg transport off the               reef, or both; and (3) investigate fertilization dynamics by                    examining how the number of eggs fertilized varies with the number              of sperm released by the male, which generates specific predictions             of how males should allocate sperm among spawns.",
