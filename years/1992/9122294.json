 "awd_abstract_narration": "Estimation and testing methods that require parametric                  assumptions about the functions in the models being studied have                the important drawback that they may yield erroneous results when               the parametric restrictions imposed are incorrect.  Recently,                   several estimation and testing techniques have been developed that,             instead of specifying parametric structures, specify nonparametric              restrictions about the functions in the models.  Typical                        restrictions used are concavity, monotonicity, and homogenity of                degree one, which are properties that economic theory often implies             about the shape of utility, production, profit, and cost functions.             Using presently available algorithms to estimate and test                       nonparametric functions that satisfy shape restrictions requires                more computer memory and CPU time than is available to most                     researchers.  The major contribution of this project comes from                 developing algorithms for nonparametric estimating and testing that             are within most applied researchers' reach.                                                                                                                             This project develops an algorithm that will make it possible           (1) to estimate utility, production, profit, and cost functions,                without imposing any parametric structure on these functions, and               (2) to test whether imperfect data are consistent with a particular             economic hypothesis, such as a minimization or maximization                     hypothesis.  More generally, the new algorithm will allow                       estimation of nonparametric shape-restricted functions and tests                of the hypothesis that a regression function belongs to a                       particular family of nonparametric functions.  The algorithm will               be used with actual and simulated data to study the operational                 properties of nonparametric methods, to compare the performance of              nonparametric methods with that of their parametric counterparts,               and to uncover features of estimated functions that could not have              been discovered previously using parametric methods.",
