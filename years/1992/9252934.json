 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Board on International Comparative Studies in Education                contributes to a better understanding of national education policy              issues by working to ensure that data from comparative studies in               education are available and are of adequate quality for policy                  purposes and curriculum design.  The board was established by the               National Academy of Sciences (NAS)--National Research Council (NRC)             in 1988 at the request of the National Center for Education                     Statistics (NCES) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).                         The purposes of the board are to (1) improve the scope,                    quality, and utilization of comparative education data in the                   United States; (2) serve as a forum for informed deliberation about             the range of international education studies in which the United                States participates; (3) promote institutional mechanisms and                   commitments to encourage cooperation in worthwhile studies by other             nations; and (4) enhance infrastructure and research methodology,               both nationally and globally.  While board activity relevant to all             of these responsibilities serves the policymakers and the education             research community in the United States, the board's influence                  extends internationally through its activities related to the                   latter two purposes.                                                                 Also included in this grant is funding for several                         international comparative studies, the largest amongst them is the              Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).",
