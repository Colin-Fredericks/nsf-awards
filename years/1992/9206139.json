 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are a number of problems to be studied.  Three                       problems concern percolation.  The cluster size distribution and                closely related aspects of the geometry of finite clusters will                 be examined for a continuous model in which the probability of a                bond being occupied is a function of its length; the spread of th               distribution of the passage time in first passage percolation                   will be studied; and finite clusters in the Fortuin-Kastelyn                    random cluster model will be examined and the results applied to                the Ising model conditioned to be less magnetized thatn is                      typical.  Research in interacting particle systems and cellular                 automata will center around four model which have applications in               physics and biology: a catalytic surface reaction model, a                      threshold forest fire model, a cancellative system with mass                    extinction, and a model for the even-odd theory of food chains.                 Results to be sought concern the asymptotic behavior of these                   model and phase transitions.                                                         The investigator will study systems in which small-scale                   randomness produces large-scale phenomena which are essentially                 nonrandom.  Such systems have long been an object of study in                   mathematical physics, and more recently also in biology.  A                     standard physical example is a magnet, in which individual iron                 atoms have randomly aligned magnetic poles, with a slight                       tendency for nearby atoms to have parallel alignments.  Depending               on the temperature, this tendency may or may not be reflected in                a large-scale nonrandom amount of magnetization of the chunk of                 iron.",
