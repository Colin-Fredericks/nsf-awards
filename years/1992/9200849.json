Various ideas in dynamical                     systems, such as bifurcation, chaos, and strange attractors, have               applications in a variety of scientific areas.                                       This project will support the 1992 Southeast Dynamical                     Systems Conference to be held from April 3-5, 1992 at North                     Carolina State University.  In the southeast, there are active                  dynamical systems groups at about a dozen universities and for                  the past three years the Southeast Dynamical Systems Conference                 has promoted exchanges of ideas among these groups.  The                        conference will include nine invited lectures and will promote                  interaction among senior researchers and recent doctoral                        recipients and graduate students.",
