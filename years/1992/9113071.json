 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to permit Dr. Jay K. Kochi,                           Department of Chemistry, University of Houston,                                 University Park, to pursue with Dr. Kyungbyung Yoon,                            Department of Chemistry, Sogang University, Seoul,                              Korea, for a period of 24 months, research on charge-                           transfer complexes in zeolite supercages.  Zeolites,                            which are often used as catalysts, are crystalline                              aluminosilicates with small uniform microcrystalline                            cavities and pores.  Internal catalytic sites are                               available only to molecules whose dimensions are less                           than pore size and only molecules which can leave                               through the pores can appear as final products.  Thus,                          zeolites can serve as shape-selective catalysts.  Shape                         selectivity will be examined by employing various                               reactivity probes specifically designed for a parallel                          study of the access to and mobility of substrates                               within the zeolite supercage.                                                                                                                                   The PI and his Korean collaborator are ideally suited                           to combine their talents for mutual benefit.  Dr.                               Yoon's laboratory is better able to carry out the                               difficult synthesis of doped zeolites which are                                 essential to the proposed research and which otherwise                          would be unavailable to Dr. Kochi.  Dr. Kochi's                                 laboratory, on the other hand, has developed the laser-                         based spectroscopic instrumentation which is essential                          for making the measurements described in proposal.                              Drs. Kochi and Yoon are highly respected chemists who                           have collaborated successfully in the past and have                             published extensively in the field of this project.                             The present project will allow them to combine their                            talents and the resources of their respective                                   laboratories in cooperative research on a problem of                            mutual interest and potential benefit to the United                             States and Korea.  This project is relevant to the                              objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science                                Program which seeks to increase the level of                                    cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and                              engineers through the exchange of scientific                                    information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                          collaboration on problems of mutual interest and                                benefit.  Dr. Yoon's participation in the project is                            supported by the Korea Science and Engineering                                  Foundation (KOSEF).",
