 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will test the critical assumption held in quantitative             genetics that heritable covariation remains stable over                         evolutionary time.  This assumption will be tested by examining the             locomotor morphology of three Primate genera,  specifically                     tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis, Saguinus oedipus),  marmosets                   (Callithrix jacchus) and macaques (Macaca mulatta).  With these                 three genera,  the stability of heritable covariation will be                   examined over short evolutionary time with comparisons among                    tamarins and marmosets.  Patterns will also be examined over long               evolutionary time,  with tamarins and marmosets compared to                     macaques.  Linear measurements of the appendicular skeleton and                 girdles will be analyzed to examine covariation of traits between               appendages within each species,  and within appendages between                  species.  The samples used in this study contain individuals of                 known family relationship.  Mixed-model analytical techniques                   allows the use of all known relatives in the estimation of the                  genetic,  environmental and phenotypic covariance structure.  The               study taxa include two arboreal quadrupeds (S. oedipus, C.                      jacchus),  a terrestrial quadruped (C. jacchus) and a primate which             frequently locomotes by vertical clinging and leaping (S.                       fuscicollis).  In addition,  this study will contrast different                 phenotypic and locomotor groups to provide insight into the                     evolution of primate locomotor morphology.",
