 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance the education of Centre's physics                     majors in the related areas of lasers, atomic spectroscopy and                  modern optics.  Students and faculty are fabricating a laser                    spectrometer and using it to study some details of the atomic                   structure of rubidium and possibly cesium.  Many of the system                  components (mirrors, detectors, diode lasers, a digital                         oscilloscope system) were purchased.  For pedagogical purposes,                 however, undergraduates construct and test the laser controller                 and detector circuits.  We are using the system in upper-                       divisional courses in modern physics, optics, and quantum                       mechanics.  Special student projects and research are conducted                 in two areas: computer enhancement of laser spectra, and the                    effect of an external magnetic field on atomic spectra (Zeeman                  Effect).Our undergraduates gain experience in fabricating and                   using rather sophisticated optical, laser and electronic                        systems.  Students observe several important physical phenomena                 in atomic spectra: line broadening due to thermal motion of                     gaseous atoms (Doppler effect), Zeeman splitting, isotopic                      effects (85Rb, 87Rb), and nuclear hyperfine effects (interaction                of electrons with nuclear spin, or magnetic dipole effect, and                  effects caused by the finite size of the nuclear charge, or                     nuclear quadrupole effect).  Finally, it is expected that this                  project will better prepare and motivate our physics students                   for graduate study.",
