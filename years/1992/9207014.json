 "awd_abstract_narration": "An architectural model of adenovirus has been developed by                      combining information from several areas:  a high-resolution                    crystallographic structure of hexon, the major coat protein;                    image analysis of electron micrographs of capsid fragments; and                 biochemical stoichiometric determinations.  The basic model for                 hexon packing is supported experimentally with a three-                         dimensional image reconstruction at 35 A resolution using                       unstained images from cryo-electron microscopy.  This reveals                   that the virion has curved facets, provides the shapes of the                   vertex proteins, and suggests locations for several \"cementing                  proteins\".  Hexon density will be calculated from the known                     atomic coordinates.  Suitable contrast transfer functions will be               derived to match crystallographic hexons to their electron                      microscopic counterparts.  Hexon positions in the virion will be                refined.  Accurate difference density will be calculated by                     subtracting a hexon shell from the virion density to image vertex               proteins and minor components in greater detail.  The                           reconstruction will be extended to higher resolution.  Difference               imaging of mutant virions lacking structural components, and                    virions labelled with monoclonal antibodies, will identify these                proteins and define virion epitopes.                                            %%%                                                                             The overall goal of this project is to explore the principles by                which mammalian viruses are constructed from their constituent                  proteins with the focus on determining the molecular structure of               adenovirus to high resolution.",
