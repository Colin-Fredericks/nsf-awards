 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an empirical examination of the relationships between                   university-industry research interaction and industrial innovation.             Specifically, it focusses on improved understanding of the process              and key barriers and facilitators/incentives.  The expected                     significance of this research is that it will help clarify the                  \"cloud of indicators\" or lists of \"possible benefits\" which have                been posited for industry-university interaction and to identify a              limited number of \"key indicators\"  which can provide a basis for               further research, implementation and decision-making.                                                                                                           The specific objectives are:  to develop a \"Conceptual Flow Model\"              for the process of University/Industry Interaction and its                      downstream impacts on industrial innovation; to identify and                    develop key indicators and measures (scales, attributes) for events             and conditions at each stage, including the stages of short term                and longer term outcomes and impacts; to identify key barriers and              facilitators which act at the various stages (some act at several               stages) and to develop indicators and measures for them; and to                 collect data on indicators and barriers/facilitators from a small               sample of universities and industrial organizations engaged in or               attempting to develop collaboration in Science and Technology.",
