 "awd_abstract_narration": "Operational weather forecast models show little skill at                   predicting regime transitions such as the onset or dissipation of               \"blocking events\" (when large scale weather patterns remain locked              in large amplitude waves) even a day or two in advance.  Moreover,              this deficiency accounts for much of the loss of skill in dynamical             forecasts in the 30-day range.  Dr. Mak and colleagues will                     investigate the role and evolution of heat sources (radiation,                  condensation, and surface heating and cooling) in blocking events               as well as how high frequency disturbances (storms) affect vertical             circulation patterns in the troposphere on the intraseasonal scale.             They hope to clarify the quantitative contributions of these                    processes, and to delineate their relative importance in regime                 transitions.  The dramatic blocking event of the winter of 1985-86              (which caused a record cold February in Europe) will be the focus               of the diagnostic studies.                                                           The results obtained in this project should serve as an                    important contribution to community efforts to improve the skill of             extended-range forecasts.",
