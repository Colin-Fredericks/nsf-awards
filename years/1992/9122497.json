 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elsberry has been awarded a grant to support a late entry to               STORMFEST observational systems, viz., an upstream \"picket fence\"               of gap-filling rawinsondes and radar wind profilers deployed along              the west coast of the U.S. STORMFEST's objectives are to improve                the understanding and prediction of mesoscale weather systems over              the central U.S. The environmental flow features that trigger some              of these sytems form far upstream. Rapidly moving jet streaks and               mid-tropospheric short-waves may propagate from the data-sparse                 east Pacific to the midwest in 24-36 hours. STORMFEST plans include             the temporary deployment of drifting buoys and dropsondes from far              ranging aircraft over the North Pacific, in a systems test for                  major STORM field experiments in the next few years. Elsberry                   suggests that a west-coast picket fence might provide an                        alternative (in future systems) at much lower cost, or at the                   least, cheap supplementary observations. The proposed study is                  essentially a feasibility test of the efficacy of the picket fence              in either mode.                                                                                                                                                      The \"picket-fence\" concept is worthy of further exploration,               since it represents a low-risk low-cost addition to STOMFEST with               potentially high payoff in both basic and applied atmospheric                   science. In fact, Elsberry's proposal has contributed to a recent               decision by the Canadian Environmental Service to double the                    frequency of its rawinsonde ascents in a northern extension of the              picket fence.",
