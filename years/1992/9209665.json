 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"thermostat hypothesis\" depends upon three postulates.                 First, a super-greenhouse effect exists.  Satellite data reveal                 that the atmosphere over the warmest oceans is very humid, causing              it to trap a significant fraction of the infrared energy emitted by             the ocean.  Furthermore, the infrared trapping - known as the                   greenhouse effect - increases very sharply with increasing SST in               regions of convection.  This creates an instability which requires              some sort of negative feedback (e.g. thermostat) in order to keep               the ocean and atmosphere in their present, stable state.  Second,               there is a threshold temperature above which deep convection                    begins.  Third, bright cirrus anvils, which reach altitudes of 16               km (55,000 ft.) and extend over tens of thousands of square                     kilometers, reflect significant amounts of solar energy back to                 space so that the sea surface cools down, hence, the thermostat.                                                                                                     The goal of CEPEX is to test the thermostat hypothesis and                 thus understand the role of the water vapor greenhouse effect,                  cloud-radiative interactions and evaporation in regulating SSTs.                                                                                                     Three aircraft will be deployed in CEPEX:  A high altitude                 aircraft - flying above the anvil clouds at altitudes of 55,000 -               60,000 feet - to collect data on solar energy reflected by clouds,              infrared energy radiated by the surface-atmosphere system, and the              top and bottom altitudes of the cirrus anvils; an intermediate                  aircraft - flying below the anvils at 35,000 - 40,000 feet - to                 measure the super-greenhouse effect, the energy regulation by anvil             clouds, and the vertical distributions of water vapor and                       temperature; and a low altitude aircraft to measure the evaporation             and heat release from the ocean to the atmosphere from an altitude              of about 150 feet.                                                                                                                                                   Since the central objective is to measure the impact of SST                differences, flight plans will span the central equatorial Pacific,             about 700 nautical miles to either side of the date line.  This                 region encompasses the desired SST range, with frequent convection              west and south of the date line, but little to the east.  The                   flights measuring radiant energy will originate from Fiji island                (17oS, 178oE).  The region between Fiji and the equator also                    contains large SST gradients in the desired range between 27oC and              30oC.  Evaporation measurements will be made along the equator                  between Nauru Island and Christmas Island.                                                                                                                           The high altitude measurements will be made over a one month               period beginning approximately March 1, 1993.  The high and                     intermediate aircraft will fly about every other day for a total of             100 flight hours each.  Surface evaporation measurements will be                taken by the low-level aircraft during the first half of the                    experiment.                                                                                                                                                          The question of how tropical SSTs are regulated is important               to understanding the regulation of the Earth's climate in general;              in particular, the atmospheric behavior in the warm pool region may             become more widespread in the event of anticipated global warming.",
