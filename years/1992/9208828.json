 "awd_abstract_narration": "A thorough understanding of the factors controlling nitrate pool                sizes is critical to minimizing such undesirable processes as                   nitrogen loss, nitrate pollution of ground water, and trace N-gas               production.  Using recently developed 15N isotopic dilution                     techniques that allow measurement of gross N-transformation rates               in relatively undisturbed soil, these investigators have provided               evidence that microbial assimilation of nitrate is a significant                component in the inorganic N cycle of three forest ecosystems.                  Although microbial assimilation of nitrate has generally been                   discounted as being insignificant in forest soils, they believe                 that there is sufficient evidence from this and other studies to                indicate that microbial assimilation of nitrate may be a primary                regulator of nitrate pool sizes.  This project will examine forest              sites along two transects (in Oregon and New Mexico) and determine              the effect of heterogeneity in carbon and nitrogen supply on                    assimilation rates; the influence of temperature and moisture on                gross rates of inorganic N assimilation and production; the                     specific microbial populations responsible for nitrate                          assimilation; and the role of plants as sources of carbon versus                competitors for nitrogen.  This study will provide information                  that is necessary for the formulation of process-based models                   predicting the impacts of disturbance on N cycling as well                      predicting potential feedback loops that will develop as C and N                inputs to ecosystems shift during global climate change.",
