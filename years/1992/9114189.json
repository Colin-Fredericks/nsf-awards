 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Sidney Benson is supported by a grant from the                        Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                      thermochemical and kinetic studies of important radical                         reactions.  Professor Benson will continue his studies of                       reaction kinetics using the Very Low Pressure Reactor (VLPR)                    which he has developed.  Two specific areas of research will be                 pursued: 1) kinetics of reactions of alkyl radicals with oxygen                 in an effort to distinguish the addition mechanism from the                     methathesis mechanism, and to identify both if they are                         competitive; and 2) kinetics of atom-radical reactions between                  chlorine and hydrogen atoms and species such as alkanes,                        alkenes and chloro- and fluoro- alkanes and alkenes.                            %%%                                                                             A more complete understanding of gas phase chemical reactions                   is essential in order to improve the efficiency of hydrocarbon                  combustion, and to mediate the environmental impact of various                  combustion byproducts in the atmosphere.  Professor Benson's                    research has led to an understanding of the phenomenon of hot                   ignition, and the factors which contribute to engine knocking.                  Using a specialized instrument known as a Very Low Pressure                     Reactor, Professor Benson is able to study the underlying free                  radical mechanisms for these processes in a controlled                          laboratory environment.",
