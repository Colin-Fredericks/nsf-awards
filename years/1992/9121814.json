Utilizing Dr.                             Burke's knowledge of American flounder, the team will                           study the effect thyroid hormones have on larval                                flounder immigrating from the sea to coastal nursery                            gounds.                                                                                                                                                         Flounder, like most marine fish, spawn at sea and their                         larvae are carried by tidal streams to coastal nursery                          grounds.  During this migration, flounder larvae undergo                        a metamorphosis which is controlled by thyroid hormones.                        Burke's previous research has indicated that thyroid                            hormones induce eye migration as well as muscle                                 development in flounder.  Together, Burke and Tanaka                            will investigate whether the thyroid hormones actually                          initiate the flounders' inshore migration and will                              predict the impact of water toxicants which disrupt such                        thyroid activity.  Dr. Tanaka's technique for producing                         flounder larvae year round and his expertise in the                             early life of flounder will complement Dr. Burke's                              experience with studying the effects of thyroid hormones                        on the American flounder and will facilitate the                                controlled recruitment of flounders in the United States                        and Japan.",
