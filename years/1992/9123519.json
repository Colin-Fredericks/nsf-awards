 "awd_abstract_narration": "Citizens in contemporary democracies learn about politics and make              political decisions based largely on the information provided by                political intermediaries, such as relatives and friends, the media,             and social groups.  This research investigation explores the                    intermediation process in the 1992 American presidential election.              The investigators utilize a mixed research design which combines                an intensive local study with a national study.  In both the local              and national studies, interviews will be conducted with a sample                of citizens and their personal discussants.  The content of the                 newspapers they read also will be analyzed.  The local study,                   moreover, will include an examination of the activity of key                    secondary organizations in the community and how it impinges upon               citizens.                                                                                                                                                       The current investigation is distinguished from prior                           investigations both in its examination of the full complement of                intermediaries and in its merging of citizen perceptions of the                 intermediation process with information directly collected from the             intermediaries themselves.  In addition, this research is part of               a collaborative five-nation study of intermediation that enables                the investigators to place the American findings in a cross-                    national context, thereby identifying the regularities and                      anomalies of intermediation within advanced industrial societies.               The study lies at the nexus of several of the central research                  issues of contemporary political behavior and will generate a model             of the intermediation process that describes the citizen's                      relationship to the political world and how it affects the nature               of citizen electoral decision making.",
