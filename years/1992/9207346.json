 "awd_abstract_narration": "Responding is not constant across the experimental session when                 animals respond on operant-conditioning procedures.  Instead,                   responding often begins slowly, increases to a peak and then                    decreases through the rest of the session.  The present                         experiments will begin to determine under what conditions these                 within-session changes in responding occur.  They will also begin               to determine why these changes occur.  In particular, the                       experiments will try to separate the contribution of factors                    related to reinforcement, such as satiation, from factors related               to responding, such as fatigue.  They will try to separate the                  contribution of central factors, such as focusing of attention,                 from factors at the periphery, such as interference from                        competing responses.  They will try to separate the effect of                   factors that accumulate over the session, such as fatigue, from                 the anticipation of things to come, such as the return to the                   home cage at the end of the session.                                                                                                                            These experiments are theoretically important because rate of                   responding averaged over the session is one of the primary                      dependent variables in operant psychology.  Finding systematic                  changes in responding within sessions suggests that this measure                ignores important changes in behavior at a more fine-grained                    level.  The research is methodologically important because many                 experiments are not designed so that their data can be                          interpreted if such within-session changes in responding occur.                 Improving theory and methodology in operant psychology is                       important for applied reasons.  Operant techniques are used as                  methods for determining the effects of physiological variables                  and as the basis for some forms of therapy for human behavioral                 problems.",
