 "awd_abstract_narration": "The generating and testing of random variables has provided                some of the most widely used methods for Monte Carlo simulation.                Several new methods have been developed for new kinds of computer               architectures, notably the subtract-with-borrow method that is                  very fast, requires few memory locations, has extremely long                    periods and provable uniformity.  Current efforts are directed                  toward methods that will take advantage of massively parallel                   systems, new mass storage devices and other supercomputer                       features so that software for statistical computing can keep up                 with and take advantage of the remarkable advances in hardware.                      Many computer simulation studies call for random input at                  various point because of uncertainties or complexities of the                   underlying models.  The construction of \"pseudo-random\" numbers                 can be  sufficiently sophisticated to give workable substitutes                 for true random observations from a natural process. At the same                time these generated numbers are readily available and can, when                needed be reproduced exactly for testing purposes or to compare                 two different computing approaches to the solution of extremely                 large and complicated mathematical problems.",
