 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent concern over rising quantities of carbon dioxide in the                  atmosphere and the accompanying \"greenhouse effect\" has prompted                calls for caps on, or even reductions in, the overall output of                 carbon dioxide from fossil fuels burned to produce energy for the               world economy.  This project will investigate the effects of                    modeling investment uncertainty in a global energy-economic                     interaction with varying limits on carbon emissions in different                regions of the world.  The project will develop a model that                    assumes long run economic growth maximizing decisions are taken.                The consistency of this objective with current economic decisions               will have implications for policies aimed at encouraging new                    technology investment, exploration for undiscovered resources,                  and energy saving substitutions.  The overall goal will be to                   determine the effect that investment with uncertain outcomes                    might play in limiting expected economic costs of carbon emission               policies.  The model will be built as an extension of Manne and                 Richels' Global 2100 model that has already considered economic                 effects of carbon limits without explicit random investment                     effects. These effects will be incorporated in the proposed model               that will take the form of a stochastic nonlinear program.  The                 solution methodology will be a distributed decomposition scheme                 that runs on a network of powerful computer workstations. New                   bounding techniques for expectations with limited information                   will be developed to bound the value of information and the value               of solving the complex stochastic model.",
