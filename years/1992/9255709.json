 "awd_abstract_narration": "Based on the research on one of the participants of this                        workshop, children carry their most positive associations                       and strongest desires for future experiences with subjects                      encountered in their work in the arts- graphic, dramatic,                       plastic or mechanical.  Scientists tend to liken their work                     closely to that of the creative teachers with three                             scientist, three artists and three experts in learning                          theory and innovative science teaching most of whom are                         MacArthur Fellows who have been meeting informally over the                     last two years.  The workshop will produce some prototype                       materials on three topics which must be of common experience                    to middle school or high school students and be topics of                       current research.  These materials will be for teachers to                      implement in classes the following year.  The materials will                    have input from students in a separate, concurrent summer                       program at the same location.  The MacArthur Foundation is                      cofunding the Workshop.  The results of the Workshop may                        result in the production of more materials using the methods                    of the graphic arts in the study of science.",
