 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for establishing  a formal means                 for collecting and storing information on the nature and use of                 academic computing resources dedicated to large scale scientific                computing (supercomputing) in the United States.  Funding is                    requested for staff support for conducting an information                       gathering activity, an organizational workshop, and related                     costs.  It has been voiced on frequent occasions that such an                   information directory, if easily accessible, and maintained with                current data, could ablely serve to assist the users,                           administrators and planners in the area of high performance                     computing.                                                                                                                                                      The effort, proposed by Charles Bender, director of the Ohio                    Supercomputer Center, would be carried out under the auspices and               with the involvement of members of the Coalition of Academic                    Supercomputing Centers (CASC), a consortium of 15 state and                     national academic supercomputing centers in the United States.                  CASC has served as a successful medium of information exchange                  among supercomputing centers and is likely to enlarge its role in               this regard as high performance computing resources become more                 widely deployed.                                                                                                                                                The specific intent of this proposal is to develop the concept                  and structure of a National Information Directory for academic                  supercomputing centers and high performance computing resources.                As a first step, a study would be conducted to solicit baseline                 information related to how users view their evolving                            computational requirements and their experiences at existing high               performance computing centers.  The study materials would be                    distributed and responses collected via the national network.                                                                                                   Given broad participation and involvement of users and providers                of high performance computing resources this effort is likely to                produce valuable information and useful products.",
