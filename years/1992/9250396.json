The equipment acquired                  consists of the circuitry, devices, and computer hardware and                   software to acquire and process image data.  It will permit the                 implementation of the various types of imaging systems                          described above.  Both required and elective theoretical                        courses will be impacted by the proposed lab, allowing theory                   to be focused on the context of the design and application of                   real imaging systems.",
