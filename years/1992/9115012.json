 "awd_abstract_narration": "The energetic and medium requirements in chemical processes                     involving electron transfer will be probed with specially                       designed equipment. The systems of donor-acceptor pairs to be                   investigated will allow studies to be made of the relationship                  between exciplex emission and charge transfer emission, the                     relationship between energetics and rates of photoinduced                       electron transfer, and the role of proteins as the media in                     biological photoinduced electron transfer. One of the                           bichromophoric systems to be studied will have as the                           donor/acceptor pair a substituted anthracene and a                              dimethylaniline group which is separated by a spacer of varying                 length. The spacer will consist of methylene or amido units.                    Such a series of compounds will allow the energetics of these                   processes to be probed by changes in substituents and the                       geometry of the transfer processes to be probed by varying the                  length of the spacer. The studies will be carried out with a                    transient spectrometer and a supersonic jet to obtain                           high-resolution spectra.                                                        %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       research of Professor N. C. Yang at the University of Chicago.                  Factors that govern electron transfer between two groups within                 a molecule will be studied. One of the groups will be promoted                  to an excited state by the absorption of light energy.                          Subsequently, electron transfer from this excited group to the                  other electron acceptor group in the molecule can be studied by                 fast spectroscopic techinques. The energetics of the process                    will be probed by altering one of the groups with other                         substituents which facilitate or retard electron transfer.                      Electron transfer is of fundamental importance in the                           conversion of light into chemical energy in many biological                     processes including photosynthesis and thus this research will                  be of considerable interest to a wide range  of scientists.",
