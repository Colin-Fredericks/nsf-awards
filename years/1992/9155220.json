 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a five year program that will provide in-                       service education for high school and middle school biology                     teachers.  Project goals are to update teachers' content                        knowledge in the biological sciences, increase their                            research experience, and increase their experience                              developing and using hands-on student activities.                               Innovative courses for a new master's degree in biology                         teaching will be tested.  In addition, the project will                         promote continuing collaboration between precollege and                         university science faculty of the University of Arizona.                        Activities for participating teachers to be offered at the                      University of Arizona include the study of exemplary                            curricula,the study and modification of the Introductory                        Biology laboratories, and research opportunities in biology                     and education.  Interactive courses on pedagogy in biology,                     developing hands-on lessons and, special topics in biology                      will also be offered.                                                                                                                                           All activities are designed to maximize interaction between                     precollege science teachers and university faculty in the                       biological sciences and education.  Stipends will be                            provided for participants and graduate credit will be given                     for all activities.  Approximately 150 teachers in Tucson                       and surrounding communities will participate in project                         activities.                                                                                                                                                     A network of Master Teachers will be established from                           program participants.  Master Teachers will conduct one-week                    workshops at the University of Arizona and at Northern                          Arizona University for other teachers in the state which                        will be cost-shared by local school districts.  These                           workshops will serve approximately 270 additional teachers                      in Arizona.                                                                                                                                                     Cost sharing equals 98.4 % of the NSF award.",
