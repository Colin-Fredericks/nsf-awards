 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on a successful pilot program in site-                      specific environmental education. Teams of elementary/middle                    school teachers will participate in a two-week field course in                  site-specific environmental education.  Materials developed by                  the investigators for the Goose Lake Wildlife Area, Wisconsin,                  site for the project, include specific glacial, bedrock, and                    historical geology, limnology, botany, soils, and water                         information, as well as ecological generalizations and                          teaching activities suitable for the elementary/middle school                   classroom.The participants will learn the natural and human                     history of the area, participate in field work to reinforce                     instruction, and participate in and develop cross-curricular                    teaching activities.  During the second phase of the project                    the participant teachers will return to the University of                       Wisconsin-Madison campus to begin development of site specific                  materials for a site of their choosing.  Following completion                   of their own site-specific teachers guide, in the final phase                   of the program, the teachers as \"teacher leaders\" will use                      their new materials and their site to provide inservice                         opportunities for other teachers in their districts.  The                       proposed project will support two cycles of teacher teams,                      eight teams of three teachers per cycle.  Desired outcomes are                  increased content knowledge in the environmental sciences,                      increased capability and enthusiasm for teaching environmental                  education, development of site-specific materials for local                     use by districts, and the dissemination of information and                      materials to other teachers in the participating districts.",
