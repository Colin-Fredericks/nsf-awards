 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will contribute to our understanding of the full range               of natural \"sunscreens\" that marine organisms have to protect                   themselves against ultraviolet (UV) radiation.  With concerns about             increased incident UV caused by global ozone depletion, it is                   crucial to evaluate the ecological effects of this atmospheric                  phenomenon on biological systems in Antarctica.  Mycosporine-like               amino acids (MAAs) absorb radiation from the UV portion of the                  solar spectrum and are commonly found in marine species.                        Scientific information obtained on MAAs will further our                        understanding of how marine organisms deal with UV exposure and                 continue to function within their ecosystems.  Little is known                  about the regulatory mechanism of MAAs production in phytoplankton              or the mode by which such compounds accumulate in animal tissue.                Dr. Karentz proposes to determine if changes in MAA concentration               represents an adaptive response to UV exposure and to examine the               possible relationships between MAA content in primary producers and             their consumers.  The research will be accomplished by comparing                MAA concentrations in selected algal and invertebrate species at                different times during the annual springtime gradients of                       increasing day length and ozone depletion, during different life                cycle stages, and under controlled light and food conditions.",
