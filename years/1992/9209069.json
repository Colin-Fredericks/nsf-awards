 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unsteady aerodynamic loads are of fundamental importance in the                 modelling of such phenomena as aerodynamic flutter, forces during               high angle of attack air-craft maneuvers, loads due to gusts, and               unsteady forces on high speed rotor-craft.  Methods of analysis                 vary in accordance to the time dependence of the forces involved.               For example, the forces on a slowly oscilatting airfoil can be                  adequately determined using a simple quasi-steady model.  More                  dynamic problems, involving high angles of attack, require                      numerical methods accounting for shed vorticity (characteristics                of the wake downstream of the airfoil).  During the course of study             leading to a Ph.D., Mr. Diaz, under the guidance of his advisor,                Jewel Barlow, will apply a numerical method on unsteady aerodynamic             research projects currently underway at the University of Maryland.             This research is expected to ultimately lead to a better                        understanding of unsteady aerodynamic effects.                                  A two year continuing renewal award is recommended.",
