 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fracture mechanics of quasibrittle materials, which include high                performance materials such as high strength concrete, has emerged               during the last few years but one key aspect is still ignored- the              effects of leading rate (beyond the dynamic range), load cycling                and fatigue.  Experiments and theory, focused on concretes and also             covering rocks will be conducted.  The tests of notched fracture                specimens will include: 1) load-deflection curves at various                    constant displacement rates, 2) load relaxation tests in the post-              peak softening range, 3) fatigue tests and 4) renotching tests.                 Part of the testing will be carried out in cooperation with                     industry, Material Service Corp., Chicago.  The theoretical                     formulations, in the order of improving approximation but                       decreasing simplicity, will include: 1) Rate generalization of R-               curve approach; 2) Cohesive line-crack model with viscoplasticity               in the bulk of the specimen and viscoplasticity in the relation of              bridging stress to opening displacement, solved by means of a                   singular integro-differential equation based on smeared-tip                     superposition of cracks: 3) nonlocal finite element model with                  cracking damage, creep and rate-dependent nonlinear triaxial                    constitutive model for the fracture process zone; and 4)                        generalization of the random particle model simulating the                      microstructure of concrete.  Resolution of this problem will pave               the way for development of better materials; for their more                     effective and safer utilization; for better and safer designs of                special or very large concrete structures beyond the range of                   existing experience; for more reliable predictions of long-time                 cracking in concrete structures; and for more realistic predictions             of the failure of rock slopes, excavations, underground openings                and boreholes.",
