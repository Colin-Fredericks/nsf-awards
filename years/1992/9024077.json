 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal is to mount a concerted effort to facilitate             the introduction of scaling concepts into amenable topics in system             theory in general and biological signals and systems in particular.             The research is an extension of the fractal systems concept which               originated in our efforts to model the dynamics of the polarized                metal-solution interfaces using methods of system theory enhanced               by notions of scaling.                                                               The research will explore resonant systems with complex                    singularities arranged in scaling patterns in the s-plane and                   uncover their link to continuous but non-differentiable functions               of the Weierstrass kind.  The rich dynamics displayed by such                   systems demand further theoretical elaboration and simulations.                 A natural extension is the study the non-minimum phase and non-                 positive real systems with an eye for modelling l/F-type noises                 ubiquitous in physiological systems.  Recent evidence concerning                the genesis of such noises by certain categories of chaotic                     difference equations will be explored.                                               The design of the new-generation data acquisition,                         manipulation, and processing schemes aimed at general classes of                scaling systems and signals is long overdue.  The objective will                be to adapt, whenever feasible, existing methods of digital signal              processing such that scaling data over broad dynamic ranges can be              analyzed effectively and economically.                                               Multifractal theories have been promoted in recent years to                account for structural heterogeneities in complex scaling objects.              The research will attempt to validate the suitability of                        multifractals in non-destructive evaluation of biological tissue.",
