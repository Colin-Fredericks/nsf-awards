 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program applies asymptotic methods--parameter expansions                   for large and small values of parameters appearing in                           differential equations--to the analysis of structures of                        flames in real combustible mixtures.  Rate parameters for                       elementary chemical steps are taken from literature on                          chemical-kinetic experiments, and through                                       nondimensionalization of the conservation equations,                            appropriate large and small parameters are identified.  These                   parameters typically involve activation energies, leading to                    activation-energy asymptotics, or ratios of reaction rates of                   elementary steps, yielding rate-ratio asymptotics.                              Identification of limiting values of the parameters simplifies                  the conservation equations and allows solutions to be obtained                  largely analytically, without resort to numerical integration                   of the full set of conservation equations.  The methods                         typically lead to formulas for the quantities of interest,                      such as burning velocities and extinction strain rates, and                     the formulas usually contain parameters determined by                           numerical integrations of two-point boundary-value problems                     for ordinary differential equations.  Since these equations                     are much simpler than the starting equations, full parametric                   solutions are obtained, rather than solutions restricted to                     specific conditions.                                                                                                                                            As a consequence, better understanding of flame structure is                    developed, the essential aspects of the combustion process are                  identified, and non-essential complications that play no                        significant role are eliminated.  This type of approach has                     been completed in a previous study for the ozone decomposition                  flame, for methane flames, and for hydrogen flames, for                         example, yielding good four-step and two-step mechanisms for                    the last two flames, respectively.  The current program will                    address higher hydrocarbon flames, hydrogen flames containing                   halogens, flames involving nitrogen chemistry, and methanol                     flames, as well as addressing issues of intrinsic stability                     and influences of strain on flames.  Special attention will be                  paid to the derivation of reduced kinetic schemes of use to                     the practicing engineer in combustion design applications.  In                  addition, the results will contribute to our general knowledge                  of mechanisms of flame propagation, flame structure, and                        extinction.",
