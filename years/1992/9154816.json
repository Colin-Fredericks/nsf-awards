 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Conference on Undergraduate Research is unique among          those designed to stimulate and reward undergraduate research in this           Nation's colleges and universities.  Now in their sixth year, these             national conferences attract more than 1,200 participants with as many          as 800 student presentations from the broad spectrum of academic                disciplines, but mainly in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.          With funding provided by the National Science Foundation, future                conferences will be able to maintain their vitality with focus on               participation by underrepresented minority students and faculty through         competitive travel awards, providing keynote speakers who represent a           diversity of models for student participants, and stimulating faculty           to design and implement undergraduate research opportunities at their           home institutions.  In addition, the national conferences will develop          databases of faculty contacts for minority student recruitment and for          tracking minority students who have attended the National Conference            on Undergraduate Research.  Travel awards to as many as 35                      underrepresented minority students and faculty from predominantly               minority institutions will be provided.",
