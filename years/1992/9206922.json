 "awd_abstract_narration": "Descriptive set theory is the branch of mathematical logic                 concerned with sets of real numbers.  The investigator intends to               work on three topics in applied descriptive set theory, that is, on             some connections which exist between descriptive set theory and                 some other parts of mathematics, specifically (1) classification of             pointsets in the projective hierarchy, (2) descriptive set theory               and finer topologies, (3) descriptive set theory and Polish group               actions.  All three topics are related to analysis and topology.                The third topic is also related to other parts of mathematical                  logic, such as Vaught's Conjecture and the theory of definable                  cardinality.  Some of the problems in the project will be                       considered under the assumption of strong set theoretic axioms such             as the axiom of determinacy.                                                         Considering that the real numbers can be thought of as the                 ordinary number line of grade school arithmetic, it is surprising               how much structure can be imposed upon them and how intricate the               questions that can be asked about this structure.  Descriptive set              theory is the theory that addresses these questions with all the                machinery of modern mathematical logic.  For example, a standard                construct of this theory is the Borel hierarchy of sets, consisting             of two infinite sequences of families of sets, the Pi sets and the              Sigma sets, defined inductively, and hence of increasing                        complexity.  One of the obvious applications of the theory is to                locate precisely in this hierarchy a particular set which arises in             analysis, say the set of points at which a function is                          differentiable.  In fact, it is a typical and classical theorem of              descriptive set theory (due to Mazurkiewicz) that any such set of               differentiability belongs to the family Pi-one-one in the Borel                 hierarchy.  The investigator is focussed on questions such as                   these, which make logic relevant to the wider world of mathematics.",
