Furdyna of the University of Notre Dame under the U.S.-Poland                   Marie Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund to research \"Physics and                      Technology of Semimagnetic Semiconductors \u0131SMSC!,\" or                           semiconducting alloys whose lattice is composed in part of                      substitutional magnetic atoms.  The researchers will focus on: (1)              Fe-based SMSC (sp-d exchange interaction between band electrons                 and Fe++ in a II-VI crystal host; the position of Fe++ level with               respect to the band structure of the material); (2) SMSC involving              IV-VI hosts (band structure of the allows; the exchange interaction             between magnetic ions; the influence of band structure and carrier              concentration on magnetic properties of the materials); and (3)                 localization phenomena in SMSC (donor and acceptor levels; the                  shape of the acceptor wave functions; spin-related phenomena;                   magnetic-field-induced semiconductor-metal Mott transition).                                                                                                    This project in condensed matter physics fulfills the program                   objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts                 and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence              on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
