 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will measure the rates of carbon uptake through the                process of calcification and photosynthesis during one of the                   JGOFS cruises in the equatorial Pacific.  The overwhelming                      contribution of calcite to the sediments of the eastern                         equatorial Pacific has long been realized (70-90% of the total                  sediment mass is calcite, and less than 1% is organic). Moreover,               half of this calcite is produced from the calcified plates of                   coccolithophorid phytoplankters which are called coccoliths.                    Using published data on accumulation rates in the equatorial                    pacific region and conservative assumptions about the ratio of                  biologically fixed calcite which is ultimately buried, it can be                argued that calcification is at least of equal magnitude to new                 production in the eastern tropical Pacific. In terms of the                     carbon which is ultimately buried on a yearly time scale, calcite               dominated the carbon flux while most of the organic material is                 re-oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2) within the water column.                    This project will document the magnitude of the surface                         calcification signal along with the standard photosynthesis                     measurements. Simulated-in-situ measurements will be performed of               both calcification and photosynthesis.  The data will be compared               with the sediment trap data as a cross-check of the sediment-                   trap-derived accumulation rates; in a region such as the                        equatorial Pacific, which is known for its large current shears,                this verification is essential.  The data will also represent                   some of the first direct measurements of surface calcification in               the equatorial Pacific and will be of significant interest and                  use to both biologists and geologists.",
