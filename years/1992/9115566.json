 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports cooperative research in plant                    physiology between Raymond Chollet of the University of                         Nebraska and Jean Vidal of the Laboratory for Plant Molecular                   Physiology, University of Paris (South).  The investigators will                examine the photoregulatory mechanism that controls the functional              properties and biosynthesis of C4-leaf PEPC. PEPC is                            a key enzyme in photosynthesis.  Using mutagenesis techniques on                maize and sorghum specimens, they will substitute specific amino                acids on the phosphorylation sites and assess their effects on the              enzyme's regulatory and catalytic properties.                                                                                                                   The French will add a molecular genetic dimension to the project.               They are experienced in mapping and cloning of PEPC while the                   U.S. investigators have the instrumentation and extensive                       biochemical expertise for large-scale PEPC isolation and protein                sequencing.  The project will benefit from this interactive,                    molecular-genetic and biochemical approach.  PEPC studies will                  extend our knowledge of light regulation C4 photosynthesis and                  enhance our understanding of protein phosphorylation.",
