 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will to examine the causes and temporal signature               of changes in permeability induced by moderate to major scale                   earthquakes.  Almost all previous work on examining earthquake                  related changes in hydrology has focused on the time period                     immediately following the earthquake.  This work attempts to obtain             a more definitive understanding of the coupling which exists                    between earthquakes and hydrology by examining the pre-seismic, co-             seismic and post-seismic behavior of surface and ground water flow.             We will examine the response of the San Lorenzo drainage basin to               the Loma Prieta earthquake (10/17/89, M 7.1) and its major                      foreshocks.  Because of the density of stream gaging stations in                the basin and the number of water wells in the region, this study               will provide an opportunity to examine earthquake induced                       hydrologic changes in detail.  We propose to examine the historical             relation between stream flow and rainfall in the region, the                    groundwater hydrology of the  basin in detail (by chemically                    sampling and hydraulically testing existing wells), and the state               of stress in the near surface sandstones and shales in the northern             portion of the basin.",
