 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase hydrolyzes 1 molecule of ATP               for each cycle of NAMN formation, and the two processes are                     energetically coupled.  A novel alternating affinity mechanism is               proposed for this coupling in which ATP use generates an E-P with               increased affinity for the substrates of the                                    phosphoribosyltransferase reaction; after phosphoribosyl group                  transfer, compulsory E-P hydrolysis triggered by product                        pyrophosphate regenerates the low affinity E form and results in                product release.  An E-P was shown to be mechanistically involved               in coupling, ADP/ATP exchanges and protein chemistry will be used               to characterize it.  Mutagenesis at the phosphorylated residue will             allow uncoupling the ATPase and NAMN synthesis activities of the                enzyme.  Stereochemical studies will be carried out to determine                if other phosphorylated intermediates exist.  The E-P has                       dramatically decreased Km values for substrates PRPP and                        nicotinate, compared to E, and the use of further binding studies               will quantitate the changes that occur on E-P formation.  Rapid                 quench studies will allow the determination the order of E-P                    hydrolysis and phosphoribosyl group transfer in the mechanism.  By              learning the mechanism of energy coupling in NAPRTase.  This will               show how alternation in affinity can lead to coupling in more                   complex systems such Ca-ATPase and other vectorial transporters.",
