 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with studying the adhesion of                        bacterial cells to membranes which are used in a variety of                                                                                                     industrial scale separations technologies such as reverse                       osmosis and desalination.  The adhesion of a cell to a                          membrane surface is a two step process.  First, cells in the                    vicinity of the membrane surface are immobilized by both long-                                                                                                  range colloidal forces such as van der Waals attraction,                        electrostatic attraction, and short range interactions such as                                                                                                  hydrogen bonding.  Once immobilized, the cells begin to                         project structures and synthesize extracellular polymeric                       molecules which bridge the gap between the cells and the                        membrane, and firmly adhere the cell to the surface.                                                                                                            Experiments will be undertaken in a parallel plate flow                         chamber which is mounted onto the stage of a phase contrast                                                                                                     microscope equipped for videomicroscopy and sensitive light                                                                                                     intensity measurement via a photomultiplier tube.  The bottom                                                                                                   plate of the chamber is a glass slide onto which thin                           polymeric membranes are cast.  The membranes will be made of                    various polymers such as cellulose acetate and polymethyl                       methacrylate (PMMA), and these will have different surface                      charges (characterized by zeta potential measurements) and                      hydrophobicity (characterized by contact angle measurements).                                                                                                   Two experiments will be undertaken using the cell.  In the                      first, a dilute suspension of cells wills be slowly perfused                    through the chamber, and the cells will be allowed to absorb                    at low density onto the polymeric membrane support.  The                        separation distance between the cell and the membrane will be                   measured by total internal reflection microscopy.  In this                      technique a laser beam, impinging against the glass slide at a                                                                                                  small angle of incidence, is totally reflected off of the                       glass surface and produces an evanescent wave which propagates                                                                                                  normal to the surface and into the chamber.  The scattering of                                                                                                  the wave by the cell is detected by the photomultiplier tube,                                                                                                   and the distance of separation of the cell from the membrane                                                                                                    can be obtained from this measurement.  The cell separation                     distance will be measured as a function of both the polymeric                                                                                                   membrane surface charge and hydrophobicity, and the charge and                                                                                                  hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell.  The latter will be                       correlated with the growth cycle phase.  In the second set                      of experiments, the detachment to attached cells will be                        measured as a function of applied shear rate by observing                       the fate of attached cells by video microscopy as the flow                      rate through the parallel plate chamber is varied.   The                        detachment characteristics will then be correlated with the                     distance of separation, and ultimately to the hydrophobicity                                                                                                    and surface charge characteristics of the membrane and cell.",
