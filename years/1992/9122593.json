The 4-day workshop                   will provide an opportunity for intensive disucssions of                        theoretical issues and methodological problems among senior                     investigators and less experienced researchers.  Presentations                  will include: 1) individual oral reports, 2) panel discussions on               broad topics of concern, and 3) poster sessions in which graduate               students, postdoctoral students and established researchers can                 present new experimental results.  The audience will be                         interested faculty and students, including students of the                      invited participants.  During the workshop, participants will                   complete plans for publication of a monograph which will include                jointly-authoried papers on recent data on cross-language speech                perception, current theoretical perspectives, methodological                    issues, and directions for future research.  The objectives of                  the workshop are to: 1) provide a forum for in-depth exchange of                \"cutting edge\" information on cross-language speech research, 2)                facilitate collaboration in future research, and 3) provide a set               of \"position papers\" which summarize the status of knowledge of                 this research area.",
