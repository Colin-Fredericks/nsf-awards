 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a curriculum and laboratory manual                   for a CCD-based imaging astronomy laboratory for first and                      second year undergraduate science majors. Students are learning                 how to plan observations, acquire and correct CCD images, and                   perform sophisticated image analysis. The goal of the                           laboratory is to allow students to share in the excitement and                  challenge of scientific discovery using modern instruments and                  procedures, and to avoid the tedium and observational                           limitations of traditional techniques. The use of modern low-                   cost instruments allows students to concentrate on the                          astronomical significance of the observations rather than                       mastery of detailed telescope operations and photographic                       techniques. Although most of the equipment for the laboratory                   was already available, the project provided modest funds for                    computer equipment to allow enhanced image analysis and a CD-                   ROM system for laboratories using the HST guide star catalog                    and Voyager planetary images. The laboratory manual is being                    written to accommodate for a variety of CCD/telescope systems                   and will be made available for wide distribution when                           completed.",
