 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most formidable problems in neural development is to                 understand how the regulation of the fate of the small number of                cells of a developing embryo translates in the adult nervous system             to a large number and the wide diversity of cell types.  The well               documented genetics and molecular biology of the fruit fly,                     Drosophila melanogaster, make the fruit fly an excellent model                  system for the study of the role of specific genes and their                    regulation of expression in the adult animal.  The runt gene has                been shown to have diverse roles in the development of the fruit                fly and recently has been shown to effect specific identifiable                 neurons developing from specific subsets of neuroblasts.  Hybrids               of the runt gene will be used determine the role of the native gene             in determining the fate of specific neuroblast cells in early                   development.  The structure of nuclear regulatory protein generated             by the runt gene and its hybrids will be used to determine the                  structurally significant part of the protein from a functional                  perspective.  Information from these studies will be used to                    evaluate the extent of preservation of this function in higher                  species and the generalization of gene regulatory processes through             the animal kingdom.",
