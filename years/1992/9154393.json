Many of these professional                                 organizations have already committed substantial resources                      to their K-12 projects and even produced materials, held                        curriculum workshops, and begun school and school system                        partnerships.  This conference will begin the coordination                      among such efforts and should stimulate others to increase                      their involvement with precollege science education.  The                       first conference will be held in February of 1992 and will                      be followed by a smaller conference in April of that same                       year.  The April follow-up conference will involve                              representatives from twelve applied science and engineering                     societies to discuss plans for on going cooperation in the                      effort to improve mathematics, science, and engineering                         education at the precollege level.",
