 "awd_abstract_narration": "A common characteristic of nerve cells is that as they are                      repeatedly stimulated, their responses are diminished.  Less                    commonly, nerve cells will respond to repeated stimulation with                 enhanced activity.  Such changes can be observed at all levels from             a single cell to a complex organism, and are thought to represent               a form of memory.  This behavior is being studied in cells isolated             from the adrenal gland of the cow.  These cells are widely used as              models of nerve cell behavior since they can be isolated and grown              in culture, are embryologically related to neurons, synthesize and              secrete neurotransmitters and provide sufficient material for                   biochemical studies.  A special technique has been developed by the             investigator to stimulate these cells repeatedly and reproducibly               and to measure neurotransmitter secretion in real time.  By                     manipulating the cellular control mechanisms that regulate protein              phosphorylation, the cells can be make to respond to repeated                   stimulation by a steady increase in secretion, rather than a                    decrease.  To further understand the cellular mechanisms regulating             this response, the role of intracellular calcium levels in the                  phosphorylation of specific proteins will be studied.  These                    studies promise to increase our understanding of cellular processes             underlying the formation of memory.",
