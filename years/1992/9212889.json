 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer Mathematics Institute for Minority Students is a                six-week residential summer institute which each year will                      accommodate approximately 30-36 minority undergraduates from the                United States and Puerto Rico.  Each student participant will                   have completed two or more years of collegiate mathematics with                 distinction.  The students will participate in two intensive                    seminars, chosen from at least four offered, which have been                    designed to enable them to explore a mathematical topic in depth                and to experience the excitement of creating mathematics.  A                    principal emphasis common to all seminars is helping students to                develop increased fluency with mathematical language, both                      written and oral.  The overall goal is to help the students make                important transitions:  from learning algorithms to creating                    algorithms, from learning definitions to recognizing the salient                features of a mathematical landscape and creating definitions,                  from learning particular theorems and topics to exploiting the                  power of mathematical interconnectivity--that is, from learning                 mathematics to doing mathematics.  The Institutes will be                       operated as a four-way joint project of the Departments of                      Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley and the                   University of Texas at Austin, the Professional Development                     Program at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Dana                 Center for Mathematics and Science Education at the University of               Texas at Austin.                                                                     The Institutes will be held in alternate years at the                      University of California, Berkeley and the University of Texas at               Austin and will build on successful institutes held in 1989,                    1990, and 1991.  The Summer Institutes are conceived as part of a               national strategy aimed at increasing the participation of                      historically under-represented minorities in mathematics and                    mathematics-dependent professions.  The primary goal is to                      increase substantially the number of minority undergraduates                    pursuing careers in mathematics.",
