 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 2 1/2 year project, sponsored by the Social Sciences                       Education Consortium Inc. (SSEC), will implement a curriculum,                  based upon the history and nature of science  and technology                    (HNST), in selected school districts throughout the nation.                     The project is organized in three stages.  The first stage                      consists of the development of a teacher education resource                     book based upon the HNST curriculum.  the second stage                          consists of an intensive summer program for 40 teachers                         consisting of teams of teachers from the selected school                        districts.  The summer programs will include content and                        pedagogy enhancement as well as preparation for the                             implementation of the curriculum.  The third stage of the                       project consists of follow-up activities in the districts,                      development of inservice plans and implementation of the new                    curriculum in each district with the help of the resources of                   SSEC and the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS).                       The NSF grant is being matched by SSEC and the school                           districts by funds equivalent to 46% of the NSF award.",
