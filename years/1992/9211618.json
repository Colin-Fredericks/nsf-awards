 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why in market economies is it the owners of capital that almost                 always hire labor?  Classical general equilibrium theory is                     silent on this question: whoever controls a firm whether it be                  the owners of capital or the owners of labor, or someone else,                  simply picks the value maximizing point in that firm's production               possibility set.  In market economies we typically see limited                  liability of the owners of firms.  We also see bankruptcies and                 often firms are reorganized and control is transferred to new                   owners and sometimes firms are liquidated.  This project develops               a model in which bankruptcy, reorganization, and liquidation                    occur in equilibrium and in which it is optimal for capitalists                 to own and control the firm.                                                                                                                                    Currently quantitative general equilibrium models of the business               cycle abstract from financial intermediation.  One widely held                  view of the business cycle is that shocks to the economy which do               not directly have a large effect on aggregate production                        possibilities may end up having large aggregate consequences due                to interactions with the financial intermediation system.  For                  example, the financial crises of the late 19th and early 20th                   centuries were followed by severe declines in output and                        employment which seem far too large to be accounted for by                      technology shocks.  The contribution of this project comes from                 the development of the first quantitative general equilibrium                   model of the business cycle in which financial intermediation                   plays a central role.  These models are used to reassess the                    effects of monetary and fiscal policy, including various                        regulations and policies with regard to financial intermediation.               An extended version of the model explores financial crises over                 the cycle.                                                                                                                                                      The third part of this project evaluates monetary and fiscal                    policy with limited contracting among agents.  A quantitative                   model with nominal wage contracts is developed and its policy                   implications are explored.  A model is also developed in which                  income distribution interacts with the tax system.  These models                are used to quantitatively study the interact ion between equity                and efficiency goals in the design of tax policies.",
