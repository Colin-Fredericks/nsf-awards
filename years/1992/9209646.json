 "awd_abstract_narration": "When exposed to a painful or threatening stimulus, our brains form              neural associations that link the painful or threatening stimulus               to other innocuous environmental cues that are present and that                 might later serve as warning signals.  The process of forming such              associations is referred to as fear conditioning.  Some of the                  innocuous cues that get conditioned are in the foreground and are               closely associated with the pain or threat, whereas others are in               the background.  The neural system underlying the conditioning of               fear responses to specific foreground cues, such as a tone paired               with footshock, is well understood and involve the amygdala.                    However, until recently, little was known about how fear reactions              come to be coupled to background or contextual stimuli.  In recent              studies Dr. LeDoux found that lesions of hippocampus or amygdala                interfered with contextual conditioning.  The purpose of the                    proposed studies is to use state-of-the-art anatomical,                         physiological, and behavioral methods to understand how neural                  interactions between amygdala and hippocampus might contribute to               contextual fear conditioning.  Specifically, Dr. LeDoux will                    explore the anatomical connections (afferents and efferents)                    underlying the contribution of the hippocampal formation to                     contextual fear conditioning.  These studies are likely to be                   important in understanding a host of complex emotional learning                 phenomena.***                   //",
