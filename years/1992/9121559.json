A personality instrument is                 used to formulate groups and performance is measured by the number              of concepts generated.  Concept generation ability is tested with               a single problem providing the functional requirement and the                   constraints.  Statistical evaluation is to be conducted of the                  standardized change data between pre- and post-test scenarios.                       This research has the potential to develop ways of verifying               design research in a manner that addresses human and technical                  aspects and also introduces some aspects of psychology and                      personality into the study of design.//",
