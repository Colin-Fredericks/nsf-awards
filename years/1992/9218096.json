 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technology of electronic and photonic materials has an impact               on and is of vital importance to most of the leading manufacturing              industries and government laboratories in the United States.  In                fact, direct feedback from local industries indicates a pressing                need for students with a strong background in new advanced                      electronic and photonic materials synthesis and processing                      technology.  On-the-job training in high-technology industries                  costs enormous resources in time and money.  For this reason                    Wayne State University will develop a unique sequence of two                    courses on materials synthesis and processing that builds on                    existing courses and covers new electronic and photonic materials               of current and future importance.  Key topics include plasma, ion               beam, and laser deposition and processing technology; key                       electronic and photonic materials such as wide bandgap                          semiconductors, high-Tc superconductors, low dimensional                        structures, and associated new synthesis and processing techniques.             Special attention will be paid to the incorporation of Computer                 Aided Engineering of processsimulation into the education process.              This course sequence isalso designed to give real world experience              using hands-onlaboratory experiments and directed projects in                   advanced electronicand photonic materials synthesis and processing.             Evaluation willbe carried out by direct student feedback, together              with review bya committee of faculty and industrial researchers.                The developedcourse will be published as a text accompanied by a                laboratorymanual and associated simulation software.  The college               ofengineering will sponsor a workshop after completion of course                development to disseminate this course to other universities and                institutions.",
