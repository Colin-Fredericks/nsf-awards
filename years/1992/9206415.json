However a major obstacle continues                                              to be the lack of well-                                                         characterized and well-documented                                               field sites for geotechnical                                                    engineering experiments.

Subsequent to this meeting, the                                                 principal investigators initiated a                                             project to better document the                                                  existing experimentation sites in                                               the United States so as to make                                                 this information available to                                                   potential users of these sites.

This                                               action is to support visits by him                                              to the various organizations                                                    responsible for the existing                                                    national experimentation sites in                                               the United Kingdom, France and                                                  Italy.  This will permit Professor                                              Benoit to discuss with these                                                    organizations their site and data                                               management structures so that                                                   similar programs in the United                                                  States can benefit from this                                                    information and experience.",
