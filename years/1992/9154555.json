The study will characterize the              research that U.S. engineering school faculty members, research                 staff, and students undertake in order to illuminate key issues                 concerning the role of research within engineering education and                its relation to industry and government.  To achieve this                       objective, a classification scheme will be devised for categorizing             engineering school research along several dimensions which will be              applied to analyze engineering school research over time, comparing             and contrasting the situation today with condition 10 and 20 years              ago.  National surveys will be conducted of engineering faculty and             directors of engineering school research units to obtain                        information on the nature and outcomes of engineering school                    research.  Parallel studies will examine the impacts of engineering             school research utilizing structured content analysis of written                outputs and other techniques.  Policy options will be developed for             consideration by universities, industry and government at a Policy              Workshop that will be convened to address several key issues                    concerning engineering research in U.S. higher education and to                 provide inputs to the final project report.                                     9154555                                                                         Morgan                                                                               A primary objective of this study is to develop a detailed                 understanding of the nature of engineering research activities                  carried out in U.S. universities.
