 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to document coastal and shallow                  marine response to Hurricane Andrew in south Florida.  Hurricane                Andrew was a major catastrophic  event that impacted a well-                    studied area.  This proposal requests funding to quickly document               critical sedimentologic  modifications that we have recognized.                 Each need sampling and documentation before   evidence  is lost.                The effect of Hurricane Andrew was brief, intense and  with                     constantly shifting wind patterns.  There was little or no wind                 more than 100 miles in advance of the storm.  This is in contrast               to previously documented Hurricanes Donna (1960), Betsy (1965) and              Inez (1966) that affected similar regions.  Andrew  provides the                opportunity to assess geologic response to this storm, as well as               contrast responses to the different   types of storm conditions of              each of the storms.  Geological modifications to the subtropical,               prevailing low energy environments of south Florida  were                       extensive.  Hurricane Andrew caused major modifications to land and             coastal wetland vegetation and expectable changes to shallow marine             and coastal environments.  Three observed    changes   from our                 reconnaissance warrant careful documentation, as they are not well              recognized in the scientific literature but are of recognized                   significance in ancient deposits.  These  changes are: (1)                      reprofiling of quartz/carbonate barrier island beaches and dunes;               (2) gravel saltation in inland regions; and (3) tabular and tubular             tempestite stratification on carbonate mudbanks.",
