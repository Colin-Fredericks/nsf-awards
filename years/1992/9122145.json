 "awd_abstract_narration": "The market structure of business services normally adheres                 to hierarchical principles, but trade in business services                      exhibits far less regularity with flows often extending from                    smaller to larger centers.  This incongruity between market                     structure and patterns of trade remains a critical obstacle to                  understanding how business services function in the space                       economy.  This project investigates how the market structure of                 business services affects patterns of trade within a system of                  cities.  It develops a model of market structure and market                     interaction for business services, and it uses the model to                     devise a taxonomy of business services that identifies their                    relative locational dependence.  Survey data from a sample of 600               establishments are used to identify the trade of ten different                  business services located in ten midwestern cities.  A spatial                  interaction model is calibrated with these data to model flows of               trade among business services within a hierarchy of urban places.                    This project shows how the characteristics of business                     services shape market structure.  The model also distinguishes                  the exchange of services, occurring within a system of cities,                  from the trade of services which occurs with centers outside of                 the city system.  With the increasing importance of business                    services in advanced economies like that of the United States,                  this research should add important new knowledge on how these                   services fit into the hierarchy of cities, and on how trade among               them circulates through the city system.",
