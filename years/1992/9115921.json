 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative                          research in mechanical engineering between Steven Dubowsky                      of the Massachusetts Institute for Technology and Jean-                         Claude Guinot of the Laboratory for Robotics, Pierre and                        Marie Curie University, Paris, France.  The objective of                        their research is to develop a series of accurate,                              integrated dynamic models and analytical tools for the                          design of high performance, high speed mechanical and                           robotic systems.  These models will provide insights into                       the nature of degrading behavior in advanced, high speed                        systems and could provide a foundation for predicting a                         system's problems.  The investigators will also develop                         control algorithms for highly flexible robotic manipulators.                    Dr. Dubowsky brings to this collaboration expertise in the                      development of methods for modeling the spatial dynamics and                    control of high performance mechanical systems.  He has                         developed new control algorithms for robotic manipulators.                      This is complemented by the French investigators'                               contributions in the area of spatial kinematics of complex                      mechanical systems. They have developed extensive                               experimental capability in the areas of manipulators and                        integration of sensors and computation for real time                            control.                                                                                                                                                        This project will advance our understanding of design and                       control of high performance mechanical systems.  It will                        result in a predictive model and effective control                              algorithms for degradation problems and improved robotic                        systems.",
