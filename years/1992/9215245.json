We have found in recent studies               that the present day descendent of the lowlanders. In pilot                     position emission tomography (PET) studies of glucose metabolism                in heart and brain in these subjects, we found that biomedical                  adaptations were utilized in order to maintain each organ in energy             balance despite the imposed and chronic hypoxia of their home                   environments. The heart data demonstrated a significant dependence              on glucose for basal energy needs, even following an overnight                  fast. This provisionally has been interpreted as an adaptation,                 serving to maximize the amount of useful energy obtainable per unit             amount of oxygen. Interestingly, the subjects resolved partially,               and in one case entirely, to the normal pattern of substrate                    preference after only 20 days living at sea level. Brain uptake                 levels of glucose were at the extreme upper end of the normal range             and may indicate at least some non-oxygen dependent metabolism to               maintain energy balance. Because control and manipulation of the                adaptive response could be of immense practical importance, it is               imperative to ascertain if these defense mechanisms are general to              the human species. For that reason, we propose to extend our study              to include subjects that would be expected both genetically and                 individually also to be hypoxia-adapted, the Sherpas of Nepal.",
