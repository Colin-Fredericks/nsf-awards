 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1986, 1989 and in 1991, the PI conducted Global Positioning             System (GPS) measurements in segments of Iceland, one of the few                places on land where one can study active rifting and rift-                     transform interactions.  From historic data extending back many                 centuries, a sequence of M>7 earthquakes is overdue in south                    Iceland and current deformation in the region must represent the                final stage of the interseismic cycle.  In 1988 a magnitude 5.8                 earthquake occurred within the network, and in 1991 the volcano                 Hekla erupted displacing nearby control points by up to 6 cm.  Over             a broad region the data support a 2 cm/year shear signal applied                to the South Iceland Seismic Zone, consistent with north Atlantic               plate motions; however, the deformation is complex and is poorly                resolved by earlier measurements.  New measurements will provide                constraints on the development of shear strain and rift widening                in SW Iceland.  The partition of the 2 cm/year budget between these             two types of deformation may account for the observed irregular-                ities in volcanism and earthquake sequences in SW Iceland.",
