 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Timothy Earle and                  his colleagues will continue their archaeological research on the               Thy peninsula which is located in northeastern Jutland, Denmark.                While limited work has been done in this area, the region is                    known to be rich in archeological remains including large numbers               of barrows or burial chambers. In a first season of survey and                  excavation Dr. Earle located a number of additional sites which                 are settlement or living areas. During the next two seasons a                   number of these will be excavated. He and his team will first                   conduct a reconnaissance survey of 2 square kilometers in two                   parishes and undertake intensive line walks over 5 square                       kilometers to locate more sites. Surface materials will be                      collected and the upper \"plowzone\" level of the soil will be                    sampled. More intensive excavation will be conducted at 15 sites                distributed across the Neolithic and Bronze age periods. On this                basis it should be possible to determine how complex societies                  developed in this region.                                                                                                                                       Following the development of agriculture and pastoralism in many                parts of the world, one can trace changes in social organization                which lead, ultimately, to the rise of states. Early in this                    process, chiefdoms arose and anthropologists still do not                       understand the mechanisms through which this happened. Some argue               that population growth permitted by a more stable subsistence                   base provided the driving force while others point to other                     factors such as the development of long distance trade. Over the                course of the Bronze and Iron Ages in Scandinavia, chiefdoms                    underwent cycles of rise and decline. The data collected from                   this area will allow comparison with cases from other parts of                  the world. From this it should be possible to separate historical               particulars from the more basic underlying mechanisms.                                                                                                          This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also increase                  our understanding of the processes which led to the rise of                     complex societies such as our own.",
