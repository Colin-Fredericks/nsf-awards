 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concentration variations of oxygen and carbon dioxide in air               are linked by photosynthesis, respiration, and combustion.                      However, they are decoupled by air - sea exchange.  Because oxygen              is relatively insoluble in seawater, both anthropogenic carbon                  fluxes and oceanic carbon fluxes in the upper water column are                  rapidly and quantitatively imprinted on the oxygen concentration of             air.  In this project the distribution of oxygen in air will be                 studied in order to constrain (a) seasonal net production of                    organic carbon in the upper water column, (b) the rate of                       anthropogenic carbon dioxide dissolution in the oceans, and (c) the             net rate of carbon dioxide production by conversion of the                      terrestrial biosphere.                                                               Variability in the atmospheric oxygen concentration is small,              about 20 ppmV over the Earth's surface during the course of a year.             This variability is measured to a precision of about + 1 ppmV using             isotope ratio mass spectrometry to determine the oxygen/nitrogen                ratio of dry air samples.                                                            The oxygen monitoring network will be expanded over the next               three years, in order to monitor the seasonal and long term                     variability in the oxygen/nitrogen ratio of air.  The measurements              of seasonal variability will be interpreted in the context of ocean             carbon cycle models and ocean color studies to give an integrated               picture of spatial and temporal variability in net production and               ocean ventilation on a global sale.  The long term anthropogenic                oxygen decrease will be used to constrain rates of biomass                      conversion and fossil carbon dioxide dissolution in the ocean.",
