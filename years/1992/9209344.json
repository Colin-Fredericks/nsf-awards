 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quality assurance is a field in which statistical techniques               and problem-solving methods are used in order to achieve and                    improve quality.  In this project, important topics in quality                  assurance will be investigated in the context of Bayesian                       statistics and decision analysis.  The first topic to be                        addressed is Statistical Process Control.  Control charts based                 on posterior distributions and credibility intervals for quality                indexes will be defined and analyzed.  The second topic to be                   explored is the motivation underlying assessments of probability                distributions traditionally adopted in quality assurance.  These                models will be derived by analyzing the physics behind the                      manufacturing systems.  Often, it is necessary to use diagnostic                tests in order to decide whether or not items coming from a                     production line are conforming to requirements.  The third topic                to be studied is the calibration of diagnostic tests based on                   censored data.                                                                       Quality is a key factor leading to success, growth and                     enhanced competitive position.  There is always a substantial                   return on investment from any effective program designed to                     improve quality.  These programs result in increased market                     penetration, higher productivity and lower overall costs of                     manufacturing and services.",
