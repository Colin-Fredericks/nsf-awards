There will be approximately               70 participants who will be  mix of classroom teachers, mathematics             educators, university mathematicians, and curriculum developers.                Among the issues being addressed by the conference will be (1) what             is algebra, (2) how should assessment by changed, (3) how does                  algebra fit in an integrated curriculum, and (4) how can change be              implemented.                                                                                                                                                    This project will have participants involved in middle school                   curriculum reform to help interface middle school and high school               mathematics.  The conference will include participants from the                 calculus reform movement to help in the interface between high                  school and college.  They will include participants from other                  countries to share worldwide ideas on reform.  The proceedings of               this conference will be published.",
