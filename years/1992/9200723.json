 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with the fundamental aspects of initial film                formation mechanisms from a bare semiconductor surface to a                     complete thin film under energetic process conditions involving ion             beams and plasmas.  The key feature of the project is the use of                in-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry operated during the film                     formation process which enables the measurement of nucleation                   pathways, substrate damage and film properties.  The effects of                 many process parameters can be determined with an economy of                    experiments and the correlation of process variations on film                   formation kinetics and resulting film properties can be made in a               direct way.  A novel immersion ellipsometric technique will be used             to access dielectric-film interface optical properties.  Relevant               and well known electronic materials are chosen for the study: Si,               Ge, InP and GaAs substrates with grown and deposited oxides and                 nitrides.  In this way, general and meaningful fundamental                      materials science relationships will be uncovered and models for                film formation developed.                                                       %%%                                                                             This research embodies in-situ materials diagnostics during process             study of film formation on semiconductor substrates under energetic             process conditions.  The objective is to elucidate the film                     formation mechanisms from the nucleation stage forward and to                   correlate film formation with electronics properties.  In this way              an understanding of important processes for technologically                     relevant materials will be obtained.",
