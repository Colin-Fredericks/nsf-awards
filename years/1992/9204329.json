 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves  the development of numerical methods               for time-dependent gas dynamics calculations in more than one                   space dimension. The goal is to develop methods that are based on               an underlying uniform Cartesian grid even when the geometry is                  complicated and the phenomena being modeled involves complex                    features with arbitrary orientation relative to the grid.                       Specific aspects include the development of better multi-                       dimensional finite volume methods on irregular cells generated by               an interface or boundary cutting through a Cartesian grid cell,                 and the use of such methods in conjunction with shock tracking                  and composite grids.                                                                 Computer simulation of fluid flow is critical in                           understanding and modeling a wide variety of important processes                in science and technology. As just one example, modeling the flow               of air around an aircraft in flight is required in order to                     determine how well it flies and to design safe and fuel-efficient               vehicles. Computer methods produce approximations to the velocity               and pressure of the air at a finite set of grid points around the               aircraft, by approximately solving a complicated set of                         differential equations. Millions of grid points are required to                 obtain a good approximation to the flow around a complicated                    object, stretching even the most powerful computers to their                    limits. The goal of this work is to develop more efficient and                  accurate methods to solve such problems, with particular emphasis               on better ways to handle objects with complicated shapes (such as               aircraft) and to model flows with complicated behavior.",
