 "awd_abstract_narration": "McClanahan intends to continue his study of the K-theory of                operator algebras, with emphasis on those that arise as reduced C*-             algebras of groups.  He will use Lance's six term exact sequence of             K-groups to obtain the K-groups of the reduced noncommutative                   unitary group C*-algebra and the reduced noncommutative Grassmanian             C*-algebra.  He then intends to use the techniques of Pimsner in                order to generalize this exact sequence to include a certain class              of full and reduced amalgamated products of C*-algebras.                             The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These seemingly                 abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For                example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is                  currently being used to study the structure of DNA.",
