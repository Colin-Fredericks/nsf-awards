 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will determine the feasibility of a                             paleoceanographic project on Jurassic carbonates in the Central                 High Atlas Mountains of Morocco.  The principal questions to be                 addressed are: 1) Can the complexities of downslope transport be                overcome, so that fossils that lived in both shallow and abyssal                environments can be recovered for geochemical analysis? 2) Do the               isotopic compositions of those fossils result from depositional                 conditions (i.e., are they unaltered), or have the isotopic                     compositions been changed during subsequent diagenetic events?                       The relationship between depositional environment and                      morphology in Mesozoic brachiopods should help distinguish between              fossils from shallow and abyssal environments.  The second question             is to be addressed by a variety of geochemical and petrographic                 analyses of the samples themselves, as well as by a broadly-focused             study of carbonate diagenesis in the area to determine regional                 diagenetic trends.                                                                   Unaltered brachiopod material should display the fibrous,                  \"keel and saddle\" microstructure typical of pristine brachiopods,               should not cathodoluminesce, and should have trace element                      compositions in the range of compositions previously measured in                Jurassic brachiopods.  Isotopic compositions themselves are of use              in that covariant trends in     and     can often be used to                    distinguish between original signatures and altered compositions.                    Comparison of isotopic compositions of fossils and other rock              components should also help determine the reliability of brachiopod             compositions for paleoceanographic research.  For example, shallow              and abyssal brachiopods from the same locality will most likely                 have differing isotopic compositions if they are well-preserved,                whereas identical compositions would suggest diagenetic alteration.             Similarly, if brachiopod compositions differ from those of other                fossils and cements or micrite, it would appear that burial                     reequilibration has not been extensive.                                              These isotopic compositions will also be better understood in              light of a regional to sub-regional study of diagenesis in Jurassic             carbonates of the southern Central High Atlas Mountains.  Such a                study should allow estimation of the types of diagenetic fluids                 that have passed through these rocks, as well as the flow paths of              those fluids.                                                                        The combination of these approaches (direct observations,                  comparison with other rock components, and comparison with regional             diagenetic trends) should allow determination of whether isotopic               compositions of brachiopods from the Central High Atlas Mountains               of Morocco are suitable for paleoceanographic research.  If so, the             stage will be set for a study that should allow significant                     conclusions about Jurassic deep ocean circulation.",
