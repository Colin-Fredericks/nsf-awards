 "awd_abstract_narration": "Comparative research on the development of modern welfare                  states treats the U.S. welfare state as an aggregate, and often                 this work must discard the U.S. case in any testing of                          hypotheses because it is exceptional.  This holds true for those                theories which argue that welfare states have resulted primarily                from the exercise of power by social democratic parties.  Since                 the New Deal, the role of state governments in welfare activity                 has grown.  Yet, there has been no explicit geographical study of               the formation of the U.S. welfare state, especially in terms of                 variation at the state level.  This research project will use a                 number of theories to examine the geographical dimensions of the                U.S. welfare state from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Programs for                   unemployment insurance, aid to families with dependent children,                and general relief will be analyzed across states over time in                  order to determine whether they conform to one of three models of               welfare state development.  Welfare program variables will be                   examined using pooled cross-sectional time series analysis in a                 time dependent analysis.  The results will be used to test                      hypotheses about the regional structure of U.S. politics over the               time period in question, and to assess the effectiveness of                     competing explanatory models in different regional contexts.                         This research will make an important contribution to an                    understanding of the causes of welfare state formation in the                   United States.  It will be the first extensive longitudinal                     analysis of the applicability of competing theories of welfare                  state formation across different regional divisions.",
