 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor William Jorgensen is supported by a grant from the                    Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study                        organic reactions and host/guest chemistry in solution.  Ab                     initio quantum mechanical calculations will be performed to                     obtain minimum energy reaction paths in the gas phase as                        well as energetic and structural data on gas-phase complexes                    that contribute to the development of solute-solvent                            intermolecular potential functions.  Solvent effects will be                    examined through Monte Carlo statistical mechanics                              simulations for the reactions in solution.  Diels-Alder                         reactions with various dienophiles and under high pressure                      conditions as well as Claisen rearrangement reactions will                      be studied.  Host/guest interactions will also be studied in                    an effort to compute the relative and absolute free energies                    of binding in solution.                                                         %%%                                                                             Most important chemical reactions take place in solution,                       yet most of the theoretical knowledge regarding the                             molecular details of chemical reactions has been obtained                       for reactions in the gas phase.  Professor Jorgensen's                          theoretical research deals with the effects of solvation on                     important synthetic organic reactions.  He is using                             statistical mechanics and computer simulations to study the                     effects which various solvents have on the rates of these                       reactions.",
