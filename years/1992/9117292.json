 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a U.S.-Japan Cooperative                                Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Research Program project between                 Professor Judith Croxdale, Department of Botany, University of                  Wisconsin, and Professor Kenji Omasa, Environmental Plant                       Science Section, National Institute for Environmental Studies,                  Tsukuba, Japan.  The project involves cooperative experiments to                examine whether, in the mesophyll of developing dicot leaves, new               cells that arise at multiple sites are coordinated by their position in         the developing leaf or by their cell lineage.  The question is one of           fundamental importance to plant developmental biology.                                                                                                          The function of clones in developing leaves will be studied by                  monitoring photosynthesis.  The development of the photochemical                apparatus will be determined by repeatedly imaging the kinetics of              chlorophyll a fluorescence in the clones.  Uniform function within              clones throughout their development will indicate regulation by cell            ancestry, while heterogeneity within clones will indicate the                   participation of other influences in the development of cellular                function.  Clones intersected by vascular tissue will be particularly           useful in assessing the contributions of other cell types on                    mesophyll differentiation.  Since the clones created will span the              entire period of leaf development, the investigators can determine if           there are \"windows\" during development when ancestry may                        control function, and other times when positional information may               regulate cellular development.",
