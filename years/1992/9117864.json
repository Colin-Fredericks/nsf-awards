 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sedimentary basins of the United States Midcontinent  contain              significant petroleum reservoirs and ore deposits of lead, zinc,                barite, and fluorite which appear to have origins related to the                migration of deep groundwater and hydrocarbons over 100's of                    kilometers.  Geological and geochemical data are abundant for these             sedimentary basins and so they are nearly perfect candidates for                constraining theoretical models for deep groundwater flow and                   petroleum migration over geological time and distances.  A new                  three-dimensional finite-element model will be constructed to                   quantify coupled deep groundwater flow and heat transport as a                  function of time.  This model will then be applied to studies of                two specific regional problems:  (1) Ore formation on the Ozark                 Dome of southeast Missouri and (2) Oil migration in the Anadarko                Basin of Oklahoma and Kansas.  The effects of three-dimensional                 flow and transport on ore formation a t the district-scale will                 also be investigated with detailed models of the Viburnum Trend and             Old Lead Belt in southeast Missouri.  Geochemical theories for ore-             solution transport and deposition will be tested with reaction-path             calculations which are coupled to the groundwater flow system.  The             work represents the first effort in characterizing true three-                  dimensional effects of groundwater plaeoflow at the basin scale                 and as such it ought to pioneer a new generation of ideas and                   applications in studies of the role of groundwater in geologic                  processes.",
