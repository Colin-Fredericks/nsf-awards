 "awd_abstract_narration": "The amount of variability which is expressed and available              for selection to act upon may depend on the environment.  This                  study will use a common annual plant, pals jewelweed (\u001aImpatiens\u001a               \u001apallida\u001a), to test the effect of the environment on the expression             of genetic variance and the intensity of natural selection.                     Populations of jewelweed from hillside and  floodplain                          environments will be reciprocally transplanted, allowing                        quantification of effect of the environment on selection and                    genetic variability.  Populations exposed to 'alien' (vis.a.vis,                'home') environments may express larger amount of genetic                       variability as well as greater selection, thus allowing more                    rapid evolution.  On the other hand, if populations are unable to               adapt to a new environment, they are more likely to become                      extinct.  Being able to predict the evolutionary response of                    populations is particularly crucial now as species are facing                   rapid environmental changes at the global and regional level.",
