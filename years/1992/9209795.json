 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant addresses a problem central to building intelligent                  systems, namely how to extract knowledge from data.  This                       problem, known as \"inductive concept learning,\" has received much               attention in the machine learning community, and provides an                    alternative approach to the labor intensive and time consuming                  knowledge acquisition bottleneck by foregoing interaction with an               expert altogether, and instead acquiring knowledge from case                    libraries.  Although version spaces are one of the best known                   conceptual tools for concept learning, they suffer from three                   limitations that restrict their use as a practical tool for                     learning: computational intractability, noise intolerance, and                  representational inadequacy.  This work proposes a three layered                approach to overcome these limitations so that version spaces can               be applied to practical problems while maintaining the attractive               properties that make them a useful conceptual and analytical tool               for concept learning.",
