 "awd_abstract_narration": "The abundances of siderophile and highly mobile elements will be                used to investigate the accretion of the Earth and the separation               of the Earth's core and crust from the Earth's mantle.  Well                    characterized samples from different geochemical reservoirs will                be analyzed by neutron activation analysis and inductively coupled              plasma mass spectrometry for the moderately siderophile and                     chalcophile trace elements Mo, W, As, Sb, and Pb and later for the              platinum group elements.  The formation of the continental crust,               involving the extra enrichment of highly mobile elements including              Pb, Cs, As, Sb, and W, will be extended by analysis of a large                  suite of the Earth's oldest known rocks from Canada.  Crust                     formation processes will be studied in suites of volcanic arc rocks             for which data on other highly mobile elements are available,                   especially  10Be.  The possible origin of hot spot plumes from near             the core-mantle boundary will be addressed by a study of the                    siderophile element content of samples from both ocean island hot               spots and continental flood basalts.  The abundances of the                     siderophile elements in different terrestrial reservoirs will be                used to determine the abundances in the bulk silicate Earth.  These             abundances provide clues to accretion and metal segregation in the              mantle, which will be evaluated in quantitative models.",
