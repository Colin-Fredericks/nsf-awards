The course is a sequel to a first-year design                       course that is presently in place. The project will permit                      formal training of the faculty in methods of instruction                        suitable for courses which will be based on the team concept.                   The faculty will participate in seminars conducted by Boeing                    Aircraft Company which are used for in-house training.                          Materials developed under the aegis of the project will be                      tested in current courses and complete materials will be                        created to permit the teaching of the course in its entirety in                 Fall 1993. The project faculty will be assisted in the planning                 and evaluation by distinguished outside consultants.",
