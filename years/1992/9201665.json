 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this RUI project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry                      Program of the Chemistry Division, Judge will study the gas                     phase absorption spectra of small polyatomics, such as                          selenoformaldehyde (CH2Se) and thioformyl fluoride (HFCS), by a                 combination of classical and modern techniques.  The theory of                  a rotational Hamiltonian suited to the specific type of angular                 momenta experienced by these molecules will be developed. In                    particular, a computer program for band-contour analysis using                  this Hamiltonian will be augmented for use on a microcomputer.                  Such a program will be of use to other spectroscopists in the                   field.  Judge and his students will do research at their own                    institution during the academic year and will continue to work                  in the summers in the labs of Clouthier (University of                          Kentucky) and Moule (Brock University, Ontario).                                %%%                                                                             In this research project Prof. Judge will use a mixture of                      conventional spectroscopy and laser methods to derive data                      about small molecules which are representative of chemically                    important groups related to formaldehyde.  These two                            complementary methods yield well-determined spectroscopic                       constants for these molecules.  The results of these                            spectroscopic analyses will be of interest to both experimental                 and theoretical chemists as well as to astrophysicists.",
