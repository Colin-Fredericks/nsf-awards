 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project employs a model of spatial differentiation to                      analyze the modern transformation of three agrarian societies  -                France, Japan, and China -- during comparable spans of                          \"development time\" (1760-1896 for France, 1800-1926 for Japan,                  and 1842-1990 for China).  The research team, an anthropologist,                a geographer, a demographer, and an historian, will follow a                    comparative research design to advance our knowledge of an                      important interdisciplinary issue: the interaction between                      population processes and economic development in space and time.                Using disaggregated quantitative data and regional systems                      methodology, the researchers will complete an analysis of each                  country's regional structure, conceptualized as a hierarchy of                  central places and of their internally differentiated                           hinterlands, and proceed to test propositions concerning                        population and development.  Then, in three comparable subregions               (centered on Bordeaux, Nagoya, and Ningbo) they will replicate                  the analysis at lower levels of the hierarchy and pursue                        longitudinal studies, tracing the diffusion of modern innovations               downward through the spatial hierarchy.  In selected local                      systems within each of the targeted subregions, they will use the               methods of historical ethnography to extend the analysis to the                 village level.                                                                                                                                                  The project is expected to demonstrate the analytical power of                  the regional systems model, revealing its utility for a wide                    range of research in the social sciences.",
