 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports cooperative research on plasma                   processes in microelectronic materials between Eugene Irene of the              University of North Carolina and Bernard Agius of the University                of Paris (South), Orsay, France.  Plasmas are used extensively for              the preparation of thin films for application in microelectronic                devices.  In this proposal the investigators will study the                     mechanisms for changes in plasmas during film growth and surface                preparation and develop methods for modifying plasmas in order to               optimize desirable properties and minimize damage during                        preparation of thin films.                                                                                                                                      Using techniques developed at the University of North Carolina,                 the U.S. investigator will focus on the evolution of plasma damage              processes, in particular, those properties which produce damage,                and the procedures which minimize damage.  Samples will be                      prepared and characterized using ECR (Electron Cyclotron                        Resonance). Characterization of these materials will be performed               simultaneously at both Orsay and North Carolina.  The project will              benefit from these combined efforts, the redundant experiments and              the complementary facilities.  This research will advance our                   knowledge about plasma processes and its relationship to the                    production of very thin films.  The results of this research will be            important to the development of high performance electronic                     devices.",
