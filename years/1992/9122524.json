 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research on global climate change has focused on                    global warming, desertification, deforestation and related macro-               scale changes in the environment.  While local and regional                     climatic modification has been included in this theme generally,                such research has tended to concentrate on micro-scale studies of               urban canyons.  Meso-scale models consider the boundary layer of                air and the city's overall modification of it.  Recent                          advancements in remote sensing techniques, geographical                         information systems, and energy balance models permit the                       matching of land use information with remotely sensed surface                   temperature data at an appropriate scale of resolution so that                  climate modification associated with desert metropolitan                        development can be analyzed.  This project will examine the                     causal links between urban development and climate modification                 using surface temperature, reflectivity, vegetation indices,                    thermal inertia, and current land use for the Phoenix, Arizona                  metropolitan area.  Remotely sensed imagery, climatic records,                  computer modeling and field work will be used to understand the                 complex set of relationships between the urban fabric and near                  surface and boundary layer climate at varying resolutions of                    spatial scale.                                                                       This research will improve upon existing models of urban                   climate modification by analyzing data from different sources at                the same level of spatial scale, permitting more accurate                       assessment of the influence of human activity on climate                        conditions at the surface.  The use of the Phoenix area as a                    laboratory to design and test methods for evaluating land use                   change on climate conditions will have important extensions to                  critically sensitive arid and semi-arid regions of the world.",
