 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell cycle regulation will be studied in the                                 roots of legumes at various intervals after infection with                      Rhizobium. Early stages of Rhizobium infection are followed by                  either an activation or derepression of mitotic activity in                     cortical cells of the root and culminate in the formation of the                root nodule, the site of nitrogen fixation in the plant/bacterial               symbiosis. The proposed experiments will focus on changes in the                expression, abundance and activity of the cell-cycle regulators,                p34cdc2 and B-type cyclin in cortical cells of pea roots after                  infection. The working hypothesis is that p34cdc2 or cyclin is                  limiting in the quiescent plant cells. Experiments are also                     directed toward the study of a protein kinase that appears to                   respond to extracellular signals such as those that are involved in             the early transduction events of infection by Rhizobium.                                                                                                        Changes in the regulation of mitotic activity of otherwise                      terminally-differentiated cells in roots of the garden pea will be              assessed after infection with the nitrogen-fixing bacterium,                    Rhizobium. During the earliest phases of root nodule formation,                 there is a significant increase in mitotic activity in what had                 been quiescent cells. The regulatory aspects of nodule formation                are not known. Experiments in this project are directed toward                  discerning the factors that limit mitotic activity in                           differentiated cells under normal conditions, through a                         biochemical, molecular and immunological analysis of known                      activators of cell cycle progression during and after the infection             process. This research problem is extremely important in plant                  biology, because insight into the signal transduction events that               result in changes in the patterns or rates of cell division are                 central to almost all aspects of plant growth and development.",
