 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the continuation of the teacher                             enhancement project of The Teachers Academy for Mathematics                     and Science in Chicago.  Elementary schools in the city of                      Chicago are participating in this school-wide program which                     provides meaningful in-service to every teacher, K-8, from a                    participating school. These teachers come to the Academy for                    an Intensive Program for two days per week every week for                       sixteen weeks.  Cooperating teachers replace these                              participants during their absence from the classroom.                           Implementation Specialists remain in the school for a year                      following the Intensive Program to provide resource help and                    information for the teachers. Since the schools in Chicago                      are mandated to have a Local School Council (LSC) to manage                     the learning and teaching environment, the LSC and the                          school administration must choose to participate in the                         program and accept the responsibility of continuing and                         ongoing support for it. This project has been designed to                       complement the education reform in the city.  The Academy                       staff and curriculum reflect the philosophy of experiential                     science and mathematics that is consistent with current                         literature. The project has supported 29 schools and over                       400 teachers to effect these changes in their schools.  This                    grant will enable an expansion of that effort.                                                                                                                  The project is also being funded by the Department of                           Energy, the city of Chicago, the state of Illinois and by                       private foundations and industry.",
