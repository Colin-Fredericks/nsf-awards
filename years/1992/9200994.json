 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research uses a new approach, termed \"activation-elicitation               theory,\" to study how the information present in an event is                    combined with the emotional processes it evokes to shape the                    organism's response.  The research focuses on two simple learning               paradigms, classical conditioning and habituation, that are                     common to many species and situations.  An essential idea of the                analysis is that we can make significant progress toward                        understanding the nature of human reactions to complex situations               by elucidating how prior learning and current emotional state                   influence behavior in simplified paradigms like these.                                                                                                          The immediate goal of the research is to measure the relative                   contributions of prior learning and emotional responsiveness to                 performance, using one of the \"model systems\" of modern                         psychobiology, the eyeblink reflex system of rabbits.                           Activation-elicitation theory prescribes methods for making such                measurements, which should lead to revised estimates of emotive                 processes in these examples of simple learning.  For example,                   certain procedures thought to promote new learning may actually                 be effective because they produce emotional changes as well.                    Clarifying this issue has both theoretical and practical                        significance.  Researchers often use classical conditioning to                  study the formation of simple associations, assuming that higher                levels of conditioned responding corresponds to stronger                        associations or more information.  A practical example of such                  reasoning is to consider a drug or surgical treatment that                      increases conditioned responding to be a potential aid to                       learning and memory.  The present approach sharply questions the                validity of such an interpretation; increased responding may only               indicate an effect of the treatment on emotional responsiveness.                                                                                                The long-range goal of this research is to improve our knowledge                of simple adaptive processes.  Such knowledge is essential for                  progress in understanding the biological basis of learning and                  memory.",
