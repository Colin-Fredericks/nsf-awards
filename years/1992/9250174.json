 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new equipment (phase contrast microscopes, microscopes                      equipped for fluorescence, photomicroscopy, and video analysis)                 will permit an upgrading of the cell biology laboratory in                      three specific ways:  (1) New experiments and exercises are now                 possible.  These include but are not limited to, a microscope                   techniques exercise, detailed analysis of amoeboid and                          flagellar (ciliary) movement, cytochemistry, protoplast                         isolation and manipulation, and muscle contraction.  (2) The                    new equipment will permit the inclusion of student projects as                  a focal point for the course.  (3) Several current experiments                  will also improve by allowing for greater image resolution,                     fluorescent staining of certain cell components and                             quantitation.  These experiments include mitosis and cell cycle                 analysis, flagellar regeneration studies, cytoplasmic streaming                 analysis, and plant nuclei isolation.  The microscope equipment                 will have the largest impact on Cell Biology students.  In                      addition, the Developmental Biology course and the Senior                       Research course will benefit.",
