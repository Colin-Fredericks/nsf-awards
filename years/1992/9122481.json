 "awd_abstract_narration": "Models containing unobservable variables arise very                        often in economics,  psychology,  and other social sciences.                    They may arise because of measurement errors,  or because                       behavioral responses are in part determined by unobservable                     characteristics of agents.  To obtain meaningful statistical                    inferences for models containing unobservable variables                         requires either the expansion of existing data bases together                   with more precise measurements of variables of interest or                      the development of analytical frameworks to extract                             information from currently available data sources.                                   The aim of this project is to continue developing                          analytical frameworks to enhance the reliability and validity                   of Federal statistical data. Attention is directed to cases                     where the use of latent variable models by researchers                          appears appropriate because of measurement errors,  or                          because of the lack of measurable counterparts for the                          conceptual variables. The investigation centers on three                        issues (i) categorical or grouped data,  (ii)  the hedonic                      approach to demand analysis, and (iii)  modelling unobserved                    heterogeneity in panel data analysis.  The overall objective                    is to refine the methodology to establish empirically valid                     inferences.                                                                          Professor Hsiao's research on modelling unobservable                       variables has been very fruitful.  While his analytical                         approach,  often requires the imposition of hypothetical                        assumptions,  he has shown that it can yield useful                             information when properly conducted.  Not only does the                         approach provide a means to take advantage of information                       that might otherwise be misused or totally ignored,  it also                    can accomplish this desirable goal at relatively low cost.",
