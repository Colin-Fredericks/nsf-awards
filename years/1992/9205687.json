 "awd_abstract_narration": "The statistical part of this project will be to study a                    number of estimation methods using nonparametric approaches.  In                particular kernel estimation and related areas of nonparametric                 and density estimation applications will be studied, and the                    smoothing parameter selection problem addressed.  Problems to be                considered include those of discontinuities or rough density                    functions, selection for ridge regression, and the effect of                    discretization.  The modelling part of this project involves new                developments of the theory and applications of Markov models in                 both discrete and continuous time.  The investigator will                       concentrate on rates of convergence results and on state and                    history dependent criteria for such stability.  These results                   will be incorporated into a new approach to Markov decisions                    processes where the state space is extended to include the                      decision set into the overall Markovian structure. Stability                    properties of such general processes will then be established in                quite complex environments.                                                          Probabilistic modelling and statistical estimation                         techniques encompass two separate parts of the same activity.                   The first part endeavors to describe, in manageable terms, models               of real and often complex systems in such a way that the inherent               randomness in the system is properly represented.  The second                   endeavors to use these models, and data gathered to describe real               systems, in such a way that one can estimate the parameters that                actually describe what is happening in practice.  In the                        modelling part of this project the investigators will study                     important models in operations research, time series, and finance               and economics, with a focus on developing methods for stability                 of such systems.  In the statistics part of the proposal, the                   investigators will look at a number of computer intensive ways of               estimating parameters with a goal of finding methods which give                 good estimates quickly.",
