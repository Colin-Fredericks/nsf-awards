 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the role of information in individual decision             making and in the structure of markets by which resources are                   reallocated socially.  The underlying theme is that recognizing                 that knowledge is neither free nor infinitely costly has many                   implications for the means by which individuals reallocate their                resources, including their stock of information, and for                        transactions among individuals by which both goods and knowledge                are transferred.                                                                                                                                                The role of information in individual decisions is to be studied                as a basis for the still more fundamental issue of providing a                  general model for economic activity.  The market as understood in               standard economic theory merely approximates economic processes,                and is valid only in limiting cases where certain information costs             vanish.  The outcome of this research will be above all conceptual              rather than technical, although numerous analytic questions must                be raised in the process.  Also, it provides better understanding               of the foundations of the theory of economic institutions including             firms, markets, and market equilibrium.",
