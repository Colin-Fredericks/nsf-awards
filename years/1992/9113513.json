 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to design, fabricate and test two new-concept                 aerosol inlets for use on aircraft, as part of a state-of-the-art,              aircraft based aerosol sampling system.  The major difference                   between these new inlets and commonly-used conventional isokinetic              inlets is the development and use of active wall filtration.  The               \"active\" walls of the inlets are completely covered with a shaped               filter substrate, and particles which hit these covered walls                   should be easily and efficiently captured.  Turbulent deposition in             the nozzle resulting from non-laminar flow, high airstream                      velocities and misalignment with the flow streamlines is not                    considered a major problem with these inlets.  In fact, wall                    filtration may prove to be the preferred method of aerosol capture.             A series of wind tunnel and aircraft experiments are proposed to                answer this and other questions.  Thus, aerosol \"wall losses\" which             plagued earlier sampling efforts may become a thing of the past.                                                                                                These inlets are a major portion of a new aircraft sampling system              we are in the process of developing.  Funding is requested from NSF             only for the design, building and testing of the inlets; other                  funding has been sought and acquired for the development of the                 remaining portions of the aircraft sampling system.",
