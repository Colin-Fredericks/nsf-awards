 "awd_abstract_narration": "The South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation (SCAMP) is               comprised of two major research universities (the University of                 South Carolina and Clemson University), four historically Black                 colleges (Benedict College, South Carolina State College, Voorhees              College and Claflin College), one large community college (midlands             Technical College), and an array of industrial partners.  SCAMP                 will put in place programs at the undergraduate and graduate level              to substantially increase the number of Blacks entering research                careers in science, engineering, and mathematics.  Minority                     undergraduates at the allied institutions will have available to                them full and partial scholarships, intensive transitional                      mathematics worships prior to college, innovative and intensive                 educational programs, and interconnected mentoring network,                     opportunities for summer and academic year research, and                        possibilities for experience in local industry.  Minority graduate              students at the allied institutions will work in highly competitive             research programs, develop industry mentors and associated, and                 have the opportunity to be role models and mentors for                          undergraduates.  The progress and impact of these programs will be              systematically and professionally evaluated on a statistical basis              throughout the course of the project.  The evaluations will be used             to assess and improve the effectiveness of the various project                  components.  The findings of the evaluation process and                         descriptions of innovative programs developed by the project will               be published in appropriate journals for national and international             dissemination and will comprise a Special Monograph Series                      published by the National Center for the Freshman Year Experience.",
