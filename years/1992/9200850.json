The Symposium is organized around the theme of \"Graphics                and Visualization.\"  It is sponsored by the Interface Foundation                of North America and hosted by the Statistics Department of Texas               A&M University.  Professors James Blinn and Edward Tufte will                   give the keynote address and plenary session, respectively.                     These sessions should lead to discussion of how the new graphics                tools can be used in the study of data and statistical methods.                 Sessions are being organized in the areas of Geographic                         Information Systems and Climate Research so that experts in these               areas can interact with computer scientists and statisticians.                  There will also be sessions in a number of statistical                          methodology areas as well as in very recent developments in                     numerical methods, including the Gibbs sampler and wavelets.                         The 1992 Symposium on the Interface of Computing Science and               Statistics will be held March 18-21, 1992 in College Station,                   Texas.
