Since the mid-1980s, states have modified             child abuse and neglect statutes to include prenatal drug exposures             and have criminally prosecuted women whose newborns have tested                 positive for drugs.  Others have adopted a services-oriented model              of care in which reporting of prenatal drug use is mandated for                 assessment and provision of services. Some states have adopted both             punitive and service assessment approaches.  State laws concerning              prenatal substance abuse are necessarily dependent upon the                     cooperation of health care providers and social workers in                      identifying and reporting prenatal drug use.                                                                                                                    Despite the central importance of hospitals and their personnel to              the impact of legislation on prenatal substance abuse, little is                known about their response to legal regulation of prenatal                      substance abuse.  This dissertation research will focus on this                 important, yet neglected issue by surveying key personnel in a 50%              random sample of hospitals having more than 500 births per year in              New York, New Jersey, Florida, California, Texas, and Minnesota.                In addition to describing the range of hospital personnel practices             across a range of jurisdictions, the research will also focus on                whether the presence of a drug assessment policy is related to such             factors as the legal climate in the jurisdiction, hospital size,                percentage of medicaid patients, the availabilty of on-site drug                treatment facilities, and other sociolegal factors.  Also, for                  those hospitals with drug assessment policies, aspects of race and              class will be investigated to further understand the mediating                  practices of hospitals in influencing the impact of prenatal drug               use laws.  Therefore, the study will fill an important empirical                gap in knowledge about the impact of legal actions on hospital                  policies and practices.  Also, the dissertation research holds                  promise for advancing basic knowledge about the social regulation               of women and children.",
