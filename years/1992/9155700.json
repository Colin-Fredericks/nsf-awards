 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ornithology is one of the few scientific disciplines to which                   amateurs can still make significant contributions.  Whether they                observe birds at a feeder, count birds for a national census, or                conduct a simple experiment, their activities contribute greatly                to our knowledge of birds.  Furthermore, participants in bird                   study programs not only learn about birds, they also become more                aware of environmental problems.  The Cornell Laboratory of                     Ornithology exists to facilitate such amateur involvement and                   education.  This proposal is aimed at strengthening our                         education programs and expanding them to include under-served                   audiences in the inner city.                                                                                                                                    We propose to evaluate the extent to which our radio program,                   magazine, and Project FeederWatch appeal to various audiences                   and how effective these programs are at communicating                           information about birds and in stimulating involvement.  Based                  on this evaluation, we will modify our programs, then evaluate                  them again.  Based on this evaluation, we will modify our                       programs, then evaluate them again.  We are also proposing a                    brand-new volunteer-assisted data gathering program, which we                   call the National Science Experiment.  In cooperation with other                organizations, volunteers will look at the biology of pigeons in                our cities, food preferences of winter birds across the United                  States, and the habitat requirements of neotropical migrant                     tanagers.  The results of these studies will be of interest to                  both ornithologists and birders; furthermore, participants in                   the project will gain first-hand involvement with the process of                science.",
