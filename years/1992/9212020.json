 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given the inherent concurrent, non-centralized nature of                   distributed systems, monitoring and analyzing their behavior is a               complex and costly task.  However, it is a powerful capability, which           can be utilized for such diverse purposes as process control, and the           development and debugging of distributed computations.  This research           is investigating the development of techniques to reduce the                    computational, communication and storage costs related to the task of           monitoring distributed computations to recognize user-defined event             concurrences.  This is accomplished by utilizing such general                   strategies as decentralizing analysis responsibilities and sharing              monitoring data.                                                                     Techniques are being developed to collect and organize                     information pertaining to the monitored behavior.  These strategies             incorporate timing knowledge available within the system into schemes           to capture consistent views of the states of monitored components.              Techniques to integrate separate views of the system state are being            utilized to reduce the storage and processing overhead of constructing          and maintaining the state views.                                                     The placement of monitors throughout the system and the                    assignment of recognition responsibilities to these monitors is being           addressed.  Event hierarchies for detecting behavior related to                 specific process synchronization conditions are being defined.                  Techniques are being developed to allocate to monitors the                      responsibility of collecting, organizing and analyzing the data                 pertaining to the defined activity.  The techniques are designed and            analyzed based on the interrelated (and sometimes conflicting) goals            of limiting the impact of the monitoring activity on the processors             where the monitored components reside and on the communication medium.               Finally, runtime optimizations are being developed to adapt the            monitoring strategies to the actual behavior exhibited by the                   computation while it is being monitored.  The possible use of such              techniques as preprocessing and filtering state data is being studied.          Techniques to transfer or suspend monitoring responsibilities are               being developed as a means of adapting initial monitoring decisions to          the behavior of the computation in order to increase the efficiency of          the monitoring strategy.",
