 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clathrin-coated vesicles are surrounded by a polyhedral lattice               of polymerized clathrin, composed of a 180 KD heavy chain and two               light chain subunits. LCa and LCb (25-29 KD).  The clathrin lattice             is attached to the vesicle membrane by interaction with adaptor                 molecules, which sequester receptors with particular motifs in                  their cytoplasmic domains, allowing them to be sorted from other                proteins in the membrane.  The clathrin heavy chain is known to                 provide the backbone for the clathrin lattice.  While functions for             the clathrin light chains have not yet been completely established,             it is known that they contain regulatory domains that influence the             recruitment, assembly and disassembly of clathrin within the cell.              All cell types express both forms of clathrin light chain and in                most cells the LCa form is dominant.  In contrast, cells with a                 regulated secretory pathway contain more LCb than LCa, suggesting               that LCb may play a role in the specialized clathrin functions in               these cells.  The proposed studies investigate potential functional             differences between the LCa and LCb light chains, using PC12                    secretory cells as a model system.  A method for changing ratios                of clathrin light chains within transfected PC12 cells has been                 established and the effect of this manipulation of light chain                  levels on secretory and endocytic processes will be determined.                 A distinguishing feature of the LCb light chain is its ability to               be phosphorylated by a casein kinase, at a site which is not                    present in the LCa sequence.  The role of phosphorylation in                    clathrin function in secretory cells and in cells exposed to growth             factors and hormones which stimulate kinase activity will be                    investigated.                                                                                                                                                   In all cell types, clathrin-coated vesicles are responsible for                 receptor-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane and for the                receptor-mediated sorting of lysosomal enzymes from trans-Golgi                 membranes to a pre-lysosomal compartment.  In cells with a                      regulated secretory pathway, clathrin-coated membranes are involved             in the formation of secretory granules and in the rapid uptake of               plasma membrane following degranulation.  Thus, in addition to                  their constitutive functions of bringing nutrients into the cell                and maintaining the degradative pathway of the cell, clathrin-                  coated vesicles play an important role in the secretion and                     mechanism of action of hormones.  These studies will provide                    insight into functional differences between the clathrin light                  chains and how they influence clathrin-mediated membrane traffic                during secretion and hormonal stimulation.",
