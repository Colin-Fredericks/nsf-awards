 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project tests the hypothesis that global warming alters                    phosphorus cycling and triggers biological feedback mechanisms in               pinyon-juniper ecosystems.  The intention is to quantify the                    consequences of increased soil temperature and decreased moisture               on biogeochemical phosphorus cycling and the response of dominant               plant species relative to woodland successional development.  An                initial laboratory study will be conducted with soils incubated                 under various temperature and moisture treatments.  During a one                year field study, soil climate will be manipulated in an early                  successional and a mature pinyon-juniper community of north-                    central Arizona.  A replicated factorial design will be used to                 test for changes in inorganic, organic, microbial, and plant                    available phosphorus pools and fluxes.  Soil phosphatase activity               will be examined as an indicator of organic phosphorus                          mineralization.  Phosphorus reabsorption efficiency in pinyon,                  juniper, and blue grama will be used as a measurement of plant                  internal changes in phosphorus cycling in response to a soil warming.           This project will identify the inorganic and organic processes mediated         by an altered soil climate and the biological activity of plants                and microbes that are key to understanding phosphorus dynamics and              ecosystem function under conditions of climate change.  This                    research may be viewed as a case study for biogeochemical                       phosphorus cycling at a regional scale under conditions of global               change.",
