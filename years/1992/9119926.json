 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Richard M. Stratt is supported by a grant from the                    Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the                         Materials Theory Program to perform theoretical research in                     electronic structure of fluids.  Stratt is developing new                       theoretical and computational techniques for studying the                       electronic structure of liquid state systems which undergo                      changes from insulators to semiconductors to metals as a                        function of density or composition.  Specific examples which                    will be studied include expanded mercury and cesium and molten                  arsenic and silicon, which exhibit an unusual level of                          cooperativity between the fluid structure and the requirements                  imposed by electronic behavior.  Specific problems to be dealt                  with involve the effects of electron interaction and                            directional binding.                                                            %%%                                                                             Not only can one find liquids that are insulating,                              semiconducting, and metallic, one can even find liquids that                    can be made to transform continuously from one kind of behavior                 to another as a function of density.  This kind of tunability                   is not commonly found in either small molecules or in bulk                      solids.  A fundamental theoretical understanding of these                       detailed interactions at the atomic or molecular level could                    very likely lead to the development of new fluid materials with                 tunable electronic behavior.",
