 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will continue investigation into the theory of                    fault-tolerant computation.  Of particular interest are                         devices made of a large number of elementary components each                    of which can fail independently of the others, with a certain                   constant probability.  The faults are transient:  they chance                   the local state but not the local transition rule.                                                                                                              A fault-tolerant computer of this kind must use massive                         parallelism.  The simplest model of a massively parallel                        computer is the cellular automation:  a homogenous array (of                    dimension one, two or higher) of identical, locally                             communicating finite-state automata.  The model is identical                    to the interactive particle system in statistical                               physics.  It is an important object of investigation in                         statistical physics and theoretical biology as well as                          computer science.                                                                                                                                               As the number of components that can fail increases it does                     not help to run two computers simultaneously (as it is done                     now in many critical situations), comparing their results                       periodically; indeed, faults will occur in both of them                         between comparisons with high probability.  In cellular                         automata, the self-correction mechanism must be built into the                  transition rule of the cells.",
