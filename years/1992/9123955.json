 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistical evidence, reports, and testimony play an increasing                 role in decision-making, ranging from the actions of individuals                and private organizations, to those of the courts and other                     public authorities.  Because of their expertise, statisticians                  are called on for information and advice, in these various                      settings.  With these roles come ethical questions concerning                   appropriate behavior in difficult situations.  What is the                      statisticians' responsibility to employer or client, for                        instance, when called on for testimony in a courtroom or before                 the Congress, or when asked by the media for comment?  How should               statisticians respond when they disagree as to the treatment of                 uncertainty in statistical analyses, or the methods of evaluation               of statistical studies, or the sufficiency of data for making a                 decision or ruling?   This project begins a process whereby the                 American Statistical Association (ASA) can enhance the knowledge                of statisticians and decision makers about the issues of                        professional responsibility facing all of them in these various                 settings.  With advice from a broadly representative Steering                   Committee, the Association will plan and hold a workshop on the                 role of statisticians as expert witnesses.  Using the census                    undercount and environmental topics as initial cases for                        exploration, the workshop will focus on issues that arise for                   expert witnesses in courtrooms, in Congressional hearings and on                regulatory expert panels.  The workshop report will address the                 roles of statisticians and of the organizations and institutions                calling on them in inhibiting or enhancing ethical behavior.                    Material from this and later workshops will be organized into a                 text using a casebook format accessible to students,                            practitioners, and users of statistics.",
