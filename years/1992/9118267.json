 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transient shifts in the intracellular calcium concentration                can initiate a variety of developmental and physiological changes               in many nonexcitable cell types. This project is centered on the                involvement of calcium channels in lymphocyte and platelet                      activation. The calcium influx portion of the signal will be                    analyzed using a fluorescent probe of intracellualr calcium                     concentration. Experiments will test the hypothesis that calcium                movement is facilitated by a ligand-activated single-file channel,              with multiple calcium binding sites providing the specificity, and              that control of the plateau height in the cell is separate from the             number of channels that are activated initially to create the                   signal. Temperature dependence will show whether the influx is                  relatively independent of membrane fluidity, and competition                    between cations may provide evidence for multiple calcium binding               sites in the ion channel. An extension of Indo-1 methodology will               be used, employing whole spectra instead of only two fluorescence               emission wavelengths. This approach will extend the applicability               of the dye to multiple cations.                                                                                                                                 Ionic movement across the plasma membrane has been attributed as                being causal in the activation of lymphocytes and platelets.                    Changes in the cytosolic level of calcium have been determined to               be essential to the activation of these cells. This project focuses             on the role of the class of membrane proteins known as channels in              the facilitated diffusion of calcium ions into these cells during               activation. The experiments will employ calcium-indicator dyes,                 whose changes in fluorescence emission report on small and rapid                changes in the free concentration of calcium after the channels                 open during cell activation. The major aim of this project is                   directed toward the characterization of the channels responsible                for the sustained increase in cytosolic calcium activity that, in               turn, underlies early stages of lymphocyte and platelet activation.",
