 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is a mathematical investigation into two                  broad areas of evolutionary theory:  molecular evolution and the                evolution of quantitative traits.                                                                                                                               The primary goal of the work on molecular evolution is to                       understand why there is so much variation in the genetic                        material, DNA, between species and between individuals within a                 species.  One theory regards most of this variation as                          meaningless, having no functional consequences whatsoever.  The                 theory that we are investigating argues that most of this                       variation does have biological consequences.  Our approach to the               problem involves a comparison of the predictions of each theory                 to the patterns observed in actual DNA sequences. This work is                  of potential value for our understanding of genetic variation                   susceptibility be viewed as due to many small mutations in DNA or               to a few large ones?  Our work is relevant to the former                        possibility.                                                                                                                                                    The primary goal of the work on quantitative genetics is to                     understand the genetic basis of variation in measurable traits,                 such as size or weight, both within and between species.  The                   great conceptual problem in this work is to formalize the                       combined effects of many genes to interact with one another                     (through dominance and epistasis) in a way that adds biological                 relevance that was missing from previous models.  Once the theory               is in place, it will be used to investigate several problems of                 evolutionary interest.  This work will be very important for                    agriculture, where practitioners require better theories of the                 genetic basis of traits, such as milk yield in cattle, that are                 of economic importance.",
