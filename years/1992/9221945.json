The design and synthesis                  of structurally well-defined rare earth complexes for the                       asymmetric catalysis of the hetero-Diels-Alder cycloaddition                    reaction will be carried out. Systems to be studied include the                 reactions of achiral aldehydes with funcionalized dienes.                       Protecting groups on the dienophile will provide a second                       contact point with the complex to enhance the selectivity of                    the formation of one diastereomeric transition state. These                     steric effects will lead  to increased product selectivity.                     %%%                                                                             The Diels Alder reaction is very versatile in the different                     kinds of molecules that can be prepared by it. This proposal                    will study means by which the reaction can be made more                         selective. The results will lead to the synthesis of new                        molecules some of which could have important physiological                      properties.",
