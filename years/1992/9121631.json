 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project contains three subprojects, in the first of which                  three models will be used to probe the transition structure                     preferences in the reaction of enoxysilanes with aldehydes.                     Double bond orientation, the role of Lewis acids and facial                     preferences with chiral Lewis acids will be studied.  The                       second subproject will develop general synthetic methodology                    involving the use of organotin reagents as nucleophiles for                     stereoselective opening of chiral acetals.  The third area of                   study involves development of a new class of chiral Lewis acids                 based on strain-release Lewis acidity, the invention of a                       catalytic asymmetric aldol condensation, the study of a                         catalytic asymmetric allylation of aldehydes using                              metallacyclobutanes and preparation of a reagent for asymmetric                 allylation of aldehydes using pentacoordinate siliconate                        complexes.                                                                      %%%                                                                             With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                       supporting the research of Dr. Scott E. Denmark of the                          Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois, Urbana.                  The primary objectives of the research are: 1) to elucidate                     those factors responsible for stereochemical control in an                      important family of reactions of silicon compounds 2) to expand                 the synthetic utility of organotin reagents, and 3) to develop                  new catalytic reactions for asymmetric synthesis.  Asymmetric                   synthesis leads to the preferential production of only one of                   the many products possible from reactions of a complicated set                  of starting materials, and is of critical importance for the                    efficient synthesis of large organic molecules.",
