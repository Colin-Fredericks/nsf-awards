 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is collaborative research with Prasun Dewan, Purdue                        University (IRI-9208319).  Much of software engineering-design,                 programming, debugging, testing, code reviews, program                          demonstrations, and program management-requires collaboration                   among multiple users, possibly geographically dispersed.  In this               project the researchers propose to investigate flexible support                 for the activities of cooperating software engineers.  In                       particular they propose to investigate an approach that offers                  (i) a wide range of concurrency control mechanisms including                    serializable transactions and interactive transactions; (ii)                    fine-grain access control for collaborative applications that                   allows a user to recover from other users' mistakes and explore                 various alternatives with them, (iv) a multidimensional                         inheritance model that allows collaboration parameters to be                    specified independently in hierarchies of groups of objects and                 groups of users; and (v) multimedia support integrated with                     concurrency control,  access control, and undo/redo.  The unique                features of this research are its focus on the relationships of                 these five goals, on flexible mechanisms for achieving each of                  the goals, and on structured specification of options by                        end-users.  The researchers will use results from previous                      research done in flexible coupling, long transactions, adaptive                 concurrency control systems. inheritance, single-user undo/redo,                capability-based protection, collaborative tools, and software                  engineering tools,  They plan to implement the approach by                      extending an existing system developed at Purdue and Minnesota.                 They will evaluate the performance of the various collaboration                 methods and study how a particular method can be automatically                  chosen by the systems based on a minimum performance level                      requested by the user.  In addition to an understanding of the                  applicability of collaborative technology to software                           engineering, the research will produce prototype software                       engineering tools to demonstrate the novel aspects of the                       research.",
