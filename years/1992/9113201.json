 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-Swedish cooperative research                in experimental atomic physics between A. Eugene Livingston of                  the University of Notre Dame and Indrek Martinson of the                        University of Lund in Sweden.  The primary objective is to                      advance knowledge of the energy structure and transition rate                   properties in selected heavy ions by measuring their atomic                     structures and transition rates.  Using primarily the techniques of             fast-ion-beam excitation, the investigators will perform experiments            on the (1) Rydberg transitions in sodium-like ions; (2) spectra and             lifetimes in nickel-like atomic structures and transition rates in              high-Z x-ray lasers; and (3) lifetimes in zinc isoelectronic                    sequence.  The investigators will participate in specific joint                 experiments and conduct in parallel the analysis and interpretation             of data.  The proposed theories and experiments have applications               in plasma physics and astrophysics and could contribute to the                  development of new energy sources.                                                                                                                              The project will benefit from the complementary capabilities and                facilities of the investigators.  Livingston and his Notre Dame                 group offer a strong theoretical program in atomic structure theory.            Dr. Martinson's experimental group in Lund are experts in                       determining energy levels and transition rates of highly ionized                atoms. The accelerator capabilities at Notre Dame and Lund offer                differing energy ranges and this will prove advantageous for                    experimentation over a wide range of ionization stages.",
