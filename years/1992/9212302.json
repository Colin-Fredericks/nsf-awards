The equipment will be                                             used primarily to strengthen on-                                                going research on novel electron                                                waveguide devices.  The recent                                                  demonstration of electron                                                       waveguiding in one-dimensional (1D)                                             semiconductor heterostructures has                                              opened up entirely new                                                          possibilities for conceiving                                                    advanced electron devices.  Much                                                like photons in optical waveguides,                                             in an electron waveguide the modes                                              of electron propagation are                                                     determined by the geometry of the                                               confining electrostatic potential.                                              Unlike photons, if a split-gate                                                 technology is used, the electron                                                waveguide modes can be easily tuned                                             through the field-effect action of                                              metal gates.  In this approach,                                                 coupled 1D systems can be                                                       synthesized.  This represents an                                                entirely novel geometry for                                                     electron interaction never before                                               examined.  The goal of our research                                             program is the demonstration of                                                 electron directional  coupling                                                  between two closely spaced electron                                             waveguides.  Progress to date,                                                  under the sponsorship of NSF,                                                   include the fabrication of the                                                  first balistic dual electron                                                    waveguide device and the                                                        realization of the first tunneling                                              spectroscopy of an electron                                                     waveguide.  Detailed magnetic field                                             studies will be instrumental in                                                 clarifying the physics of transport                                             and tunneling of electrons in these                                             dual electron waveguide devices.",
