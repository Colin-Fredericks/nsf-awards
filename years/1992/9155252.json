 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year project, sponsored by Texas A&M University,                     provides a four week summer program each year for 32                            psychology teachers to prepare them to teach the advanced                       placement psychology course.  The summer program will cover                     all the major areas of psychology but emphasis will be given                    on those areas known to receive insufficient coverage in the                    typical high school course.  Topics included will be                            cognition, neuropsychology, sensation and perception and                        research methods.  The summer program will generate a wide                      variety of materials for conducting an honors psychology                        course emphasizing active learning exercises which can be                       used to establish a laboratory component for the course.  The                   project will result in more courses offered at the high                         school level which provide a more accurate understanding of                     the scientific method, particularly as it applies to the                        science of psychology.                                                                                                                                          This project is supported by matching funds from the                            university which are equivalent to 28% of the NSF grant.",
