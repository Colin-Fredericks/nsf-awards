 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor Glen Hurlbert                for research in graph theory and other areas of combinatorics.                  Professor Hurlbert will study universal cycles and partially                    ordered sets as well as problems in combinatorial number theory                 and combinatorial geometry.                                                          Graph Theory go back perhaps two hundred years, but only in                the last half-century has the field become an active, fertile,                  and flourishing branch of mathematics.  A graph is a network of                 lines (\"edges\") joining points (\"vertices\"), thus the language of               graphs becomes a natural way of describing interrelationships                   among separated objects.  Graph Theory figures most prominently                 as an essential tool in Communications Theory and Computer                      Science.  Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to                   study how discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And,               so it to is extremely important to modern communications.",
