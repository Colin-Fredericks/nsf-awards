 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed projects has two major objectives:  1)                             development of a new optical diagnostic capable of making                       simultaneous, full-field measurements of all three velocity                     components and particle size and number density distributions                   in two-phase flows, and 2) characterization of particle                         trajectories and size distributions in an arc spray coating                     system and their relation to coating porosity and grain                         structure.  The accuracy and  dynamic range limitations of the                                                                                                  new technique will first be characterize in a small wind                        tunnel seeded with known size particles.  Both free stream and                                                                                                  stagnation flow measurements will be made and compared to                       independently measured velocity profiles.  A single solid-                      state camera would acquire images of particle velocities (all                   three components), sizes, and number densities.                                                                                                                 The technique will be used to characterize the relationship                     between particle velocities, size, and temperature to coating                   quality in an arc spray system.  Similar conditions exists in                   paint sprays and fuel sprays.",
