 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Science in Developing Countries award will                                 support the collaboration of Kenneth Klabunde of                                Kansas State University  and Galo Cardenas-                                     Trivino of the University of Conception, Chile.  The                            project aims to (1) prepare M-solvent colloids with                             Cu, Ag, and Sn, and with monomers such as styrene and                           methylmethacrylate; (2) characterize colloidal                                  particles by electrophoresis, TEM, SEM, FTIR,                                   Mossbauer, and SRS; and (3) characterize metallic                               films formed from the colloids by TGA, DSC,                                     microanalyses, and resistivity measurements.                                                                                                                    The researchers will use a new method for preparing                             nonaqueous colloidal metal particles, using metal                               evaporation and solvation of atoms in excess cold                               organic solvents.  The mobile metal atoms cluster upon                          warming.  The forming particles stop growing due to                             solvation and electrostatic repulsion.  Various metals                          have been shown to form stable colloidal solutions.                             The major interest in these new colloids is in their                            use as metallic film precursors.  The researchers aim                           to develop them for chemical liquid (rather than                                vapor) deposition of films.  With a recent patent,                              much industrial interest has developed.  This joint                             project is expected to facilitate progress in metal-                            colloid, metal film work.  The U.S. side has expertise                          in colloid chemistry and state-of-the-art equipment                             for preparing and analyzing colloidal  solutions and                            metal films.  The Chilean side has expertise in                                 polymer characterization and necessary TGA, DSC, and                            TEM/SEM facilities, which the U.S. side lacks.",
