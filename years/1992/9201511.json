 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the summer of 1991 southern Minnesota experienced a                      sustained period of unusually heavy precipitation and high                      relative humidity.  These conditions have seriously affected                    several ethnographic collections housed in the Science Museum of                Minnesota and permitted the development of mold.  If untreated                  this infestation may permanently damage irreplaceable specimens.                These materials include several hundred Chiapas Maya and                        Guatemalan Maya textiles and other artifacts; hundreds of                       Blackfeet and other Northern Plains Native American objects such                as beaded leather shirts, leggings, dresses and containers; and                 200 baskets from the upper Great Lakes region and central                       Minnesota dating from the 19th and early 20th centuries.  These                 collections have been recognized as among the finest and best                   documented North American ethnographic collections in the world                 today.  With NSF support, appropriate conservation measures will                be conducted and the materials restored until steps can be taken                to permanently remedy the situation.                                                                                                                            Such collections are of prime importance to anthropologists who                 study material culture and society- environmental interactions.                 This grant will help to prevent damage to irreplaceable                         materials.",
