 "awd_abstract_narration": "An inverted Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) system                    is requested.  There is no confocal system at the medical                       school nor, to the best of our knowledge, in the entire                         Atlanta University Center Complex ( includes the Atlanta                        University Center,  Morehouse College, Selman College, Clark-                   Atlanta University, Morris Brown College).  The requested                       instrumentation will greatly expand the research                                capabilities at the medical school and provide a resource                       for minority graduate and undergraduate schools in the                          complex.  Within the medical school, the requested                              instrumentation will be used to support five major research                     projects headed by senior investigators plus occasional used                    by a number of other investigators.  All laboratories in the                    proposal are presently, or have plans to be involved in the                     training of graduate students and/or postdoctoral fellows                       with an emphasis on the training of minorities.  Several                        laboratories have also participated in summer programs to                       expose minority medical  students to research.  Area of                         research (major projects) the requested instrumentation will                    support include fluorescent immunolocalization/co-                              localization/ 3-D reconstruction of cytoskeletal and other                      cellular proteins in tissue sections and fixed cell layer                       (Chew, Lo, Bailey,  Scanlon), detection and 3-D                                 reconstruction of transcripts detected using fluorescent in                     situ hybridization technique (Bond), and fluorescent                            localization of intracellular  calcium storage/release sites                    in living cells along with co-localization of relevant                          cellular structures (Scanlon, Chew. ).  The 3D                                  reconstruction capabilities of the system will provide                          investigators with insights into cell structure that cannot                     be obtained with conventional fluorescent microscopy.",
