 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the beginning of the industrial revolution the CO2                        concentration in the atmosphere has risen by approximately 25%,                 from 280 ppmv to 350 ppmv.  Current climate models estimate that                even if man-made emissions of CO2 could be kept at present rates,               atmospheric CO2 would increase to about 450 ppmv by the year 2050,              and to about 520 ppmv by the year 2100 (IPCC 1990).  These                      increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration, combined with                       increases in the concentrations of other greenhouse gases such as               methane and nitrous oxide, are predicted to lead to global climate              change comprised of higher temperatures and changes in the                      hydrological cycle.  How will simultaneous changes of CO2                       concentration and climate affect linked plant and soil processes?               This is one of today's critical environmental questions.                                                                                                        The U.S. National Committee of SCOPE (Scientific Committee on                   Problems of the Environment) will hold a workshop on linked                     vegetation and soil responses to increasing CO2 and climate                     change.  The goals of the Workshop are:                                                                                                                         1)    To coalesce current understanding of CO2 and climate change                     effects on linked vegetation and soil systems, both natural                     and managed.                                                                                                                                              2)    To evaluate our ability to predict responses of both natural                    ecosystems and agroecosystems to simultaneous changes in CO2                    and climate.                                                                                                                                              Contributions from agronomists, ecologists, plant physiologists,                and soil scientists will be needed to accomplish these goals.                   Both experimentalists and modeler will be invited because a                     crucial aim of the workshop is to improve communication between                 those scientists conducting laboratory and field research on                    increasing CO2 and land use and those scientists who are                        projecting the potential effects of changing atmosphere and                     climate on ecosystems through the use of models.",
