 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study-group based learning system is being introduced into                    the general chemistry course at the University of Connecticut.                  The large lecture classes are broken into study groups of 3-5                   students.  Faculty, graduate assistants, and undergraduates                     act as monitors of study groups, which meet once weekly.  Study                 group members responsible for assigned problems present and                     explain their solution. Each person also submits a quiz                         question similar to his or her assigned problem.  After                         modification by the monitor, one of these questions are used as                 a future quiz question for the class.  Another feature of the                   study groups is the distribution of a worksheet which the study                 groups work on together. The worksheet requires the students to                 solve problems without benefit of text, thereby simulating                      examination conditions.",
