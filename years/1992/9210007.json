 "awd_abstract_narration": "The high metabolism of hummingbirds is fueled principally by the                sugar found in nectar, but consumed along with the sugar is an                  excess of water that can amount to several time the bird's own body             mass per day.  In hummingbirds, the kidney and the gastrointestinal             tract mush consequently play coordinated roles in the regulation of             water, electrolyte, and energy balance.  Beuchat describes a series             of experiments, including measurements of GFR and tubular water                 reabsorption in the kidney, and of water and glucose absorption in              the intestine, that will isolate fundamental components of the                  mechanisms hummingbirds use to regulate energy, water, and                      electrolyte balance.  The project's focus on basic kidney function              and on the integration of renal with intestinal function in                     hummingbirds will provide fundamental information about the                     physiology of these animals.  In a broader perspective, this study              will be the first to closely examine the osmoregulatory physiology              of a bird or mammal that is a model organism for the study of                   chronic diuresis.  Finally, this study will be first in vivo test               of the hypothesis that paracellular fluid flux activated by Na+-                coupled glucose transport can play a significant role in nutrient               uptake in vertebrates.",
