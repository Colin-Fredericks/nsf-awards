 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to increase our understanding of the               mechanisms that normally regulate homologous recombination in                   mammalian cells.  Such an aim seems relevant in light of the often              made observation that cancer cells exhibit aberrant chromosomal                 rearrangements.  To study homologous recombination, mouse Ltk cell              lines will be transfected with DNA substrates that contain two                  defective Herpes thymidine kinase (tk) gene sequences.                          Recombination events that reconstruct a functional tk gene will be              monitored by the appearance of tk-positive cells.  This work will               refine earlier measurements of the homology dependence of \"normal\"              recombination as well as explore the possibility that DNA lesions               or sequences that promote DNA strand breakage can alter the rate                or relax the homology requirements of recombination.                            %%%                                                                             This proposal also includes studies of \"gene targeting\", or                     homologous recombination between a transfected molecule and a                   specific chromosomal target sequence.  Gene targeting offers a                  powerful tool for studying gene function and potentially a                      methodology for eventual gene therapy.  By studying gene targeting              events involving a selectable chromosomal marker, they propose to               measure the homology dependence as well as make an assessment of                the rate-limiting step of targeted recombination.  Experiments will             also be done to test the hypotheses that inhibiting random                      integration of DNA into a mammalian genome will improve targeting               efficiency.",
