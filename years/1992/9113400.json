 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor William B. Jones of the                           University of Colorado and two of his graduate students to                      collaborate in mathematics research with Professors Olav                        Njastad, Haakon Waadeland and others of the University of                       Trondheim, Norway.  Professor Jones is devoting his                             sabbatical year to continuing his fruitful collaboration                        with Norwegian mathematicians.  During this period, two of                      his graduate students will visit Norway with support from                       this grant to work with the Norwegian group.  The subject                       of this U.S.-Norwegian collaboration in classical analysis                      is rational interpolation in the complex domain by Pade                         approximants and continued fractions.  The joint work will                      involve applications of this technique in moment theory,                        orthogonal polynomials and Gaussian quadrature.  The                            collaborators will also pursue mathematical research on                         digital signal processing, including the determination of                       hidden periodicities.                                                                                                                                           Pade approximants and their generalizations are employed in                     the theory and applications of many areas of mathematics.                       The development of high speed computers has stimulated                          applications in the physical and engineering sciences.  The                     substantial current interest and range of activity in this                      field will benefit from the results of this U.S.-Norway                         collaboration.",
