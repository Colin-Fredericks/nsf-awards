 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work done on this project combines elements of the theory of               several complex variables with those of harmonic analysis on                    Euclidean domains with applications to partial differential                     equations. During the past five years or so, developments in the                analysis of functions of two complex variables on pseudoconvex                  domains has reached the level of completeness comparable to what                is known for strictly pseudoconvex domains in arbitrary                         dimension.  Regularity results for the Bergman and Szego                        projections, sharp estimates for the basic differential operators               and characterizations of zero varieties are well understood.  The               present work will continue the task of extending these kinds of                 results to domains (of finite type) of dimension greater than                   two.                                                                                 A second fundamental problem concerns metrics on the                       boundary of domains.  If the domain has finite type, then the                   metrics, although not unique, are classified.  For domains of                   general type, it is not even known if there is a reasonable                     boundary metric which can be used to analyze some of the                        important analytic objects on the domain.  Work is proceeding                   through the study of specific domains to clarify the right                      questions to be studied. Work on Fourier analysis is related to                 Fourier transforms of measures defined on submanifolds in                       Euclidean space.  Estimates of the transform have important                     applications in a variety of problems ranging from number theory                to partial differential equations.  The best results to date                    assume that the manifold is the boundary of a convex domain.                    Little is known if the domain is nonconvex or if the manifold has               high codimension.  Although some information is available                       concerning the transform at infinity, much remains to be done in                obtaining geometric description and interpretation of the                       transform and its antecedent measure.",
