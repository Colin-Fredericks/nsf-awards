 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advent of the Intel Delta machine, a large-scale parallel                   computer with powerful i860 nodes and high speed communications                 between the nodes, combined with fast algorithms in computational               fluid mechanics, will allow unprecedented explorations, via                     numerical simulations, of complex flows with and without solid                  boundaries.                                                                                                                                                     Our computational method is based in the Lagrangian description                 of the vorticity field.  Computational elements of vector-valued                vorticity are convected with the local fluid velocity and the                   vorticity vector is continually strained by the local velocity                  gradient.  The classical vortex method is enhanced to account for               viscous effects.  An adaptive, fast algorithm has been                          efficiently implemented in two-dimensions, in both vector (CRAYS)               and parallel (Mark III hypercube) architectures allowing                        unprecedented simulations using up to O(10 6) computational                     elements.                                                                                                                                                       We propose to extend the viscous technique to three-dimensional                 flows in the presence of arbitrarily-shaped solid bodies and                    implement a fast three-dimensional algorithm on the Delta.  We                  expect to obtain computing speeds that are much higher than those               of a serial supercomputer speed at a fraction of the cost,                      allowing simulations using up to O(10 6) computational elements                 for three and two-dimensional simulations.  This capability will                allow large scale extended numerical simulations, in two and                    three dimensions, for laboratory Reynolds numbers and should lead               to significant breakthroughs in the understanding and control of                complex flow phenomena that are fundamental to unsteady bluff-                  body flows.",
