 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides for collaboration by an                     Indian scientist, Dr. P.K. Dash of the Department of Electrical                 Engineering, Regional Engineering College (REC), Rourkela, and a                U.S. scientist, Dr. Saifur Rahman of the Department of Electrical               Engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI) in                          Blacksburg.  The scientists plan to study the complex                           relationships between the time and intensity of an electric                     utility's peak load, and the potential for cost reduction                       strategies by the utilities and consumers.  The study also seeks                to develop means for two-way exchange of information to be used                 for decisions such as production scheduling and load control.                   The development of solutions will combine the capabilities of                   both expert systems approach and statistical techniques.                                                                                                        Scope:  This collaboration will build on existing research being                done by Dr. Rahman under an NSF/ECS grant.  This collaboration                  will benefit both sides by combining the abilities of the Indian                group to collect data from unique conditions in India and the                   advanced modelling and computational techniques at VPI.  The                    project meets the objectives of the U.S.-India Program.",
