 "awd_abstract_narration": "Factors which interact with and influence complex learned behavior              include circulating hormone levels, brain neurotransmitters and                 changes in neuroanatomy. In this award, Dr. Cheryl Harding will                 quantify levels and turnover of two transmitter substances,                     norepinephrine and dopamine, in a variety of brain regions involved             in avian vocal learning. The studies will be done at critical times             during brain development and the sensitive period for vocal                     learning. In adults, levels and turnover of these neurotransmitters             in the brain areas under study are strongly modulated by                        circulating hormone levels. Therefore, circulating hormone levels               will also be assessed to determine if changing hormone levels                   during development have similar effects on neurotransmitter                     function. This research will look for evidence that these                       neurotranmitters might be involved in stimulating some of the                   dramatic neuroanatomical changes which occur in these brain areas               during early development and the period of vocal learning. The                  potential contributions of norepinephrine and dopamine in these                 areas to the learning of a complex social beahvior and the                      modulation of this process by circulating hormones will also be                 assessed. The knowledge gained in these studies will be important               in understanding the factors which are involved in the development              and learning of vocalization and communication.",
