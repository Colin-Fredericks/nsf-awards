 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the mechanisms of electron and proton                    transfer in the reaction center complex of the photosynthetic                   bacteria, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodopseudomonas viridis, for             which the structure of the reaction center (RC) is known at atomic              resolution.  The main focus is the two quinone molecules that act               as electron acceptors to the photochemical events.  The quinones                undergo one-electron reduction to the semiquinone, and double                   reduction to the quinol state, which also requires uptake of                    protons from the aqueous medium.  The work aims to identify amino               acid residues active in the binding of both quinones, in the                    stabilization of the semiquinone states, in the establishment of                the functional redox potentials of the two quinones, and in the                 proton transfer pathways leading to formation of the quinol state.              The effects of specific mutations on the functional redox and acid-             base properties of the to-electron gate, in Rb. Sphaeroides, will               be investigated by kinetic and equilibrium techniques based on                  optical spectroscopy and electrometric measurements.  These will be             supplemented by structural studies, including X-ray difference                  analysis where possible, and infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), and by              computational approaches, utilizing the comparative virtues of                  mutant RCs to maximum effect.                                                   %%%                                                                             The primary goals of this work are (1) to demonstrate and                       understand how specific activities and properties are induced in                biological cofactors by protein-ligand interactions, and (2) to                 investigate the mechanism of proton transfer through proteins.                  These are important general issues in enzymatic catalysis and                   biological specificity.  The reaction center quinones are uniquely              suited for these investigations, through the great experimental                 amenability of the system for biophysical measurements and for                  protein engineering.",
