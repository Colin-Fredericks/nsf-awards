 "awd_abstract_narration": "Classrooms of 30 to 300 students, although commonplace,                         provide poor learning environments in schools and colleges.                     Active learning significantly improves on traditional                           methods.  With low-cost classroom communications systems                        (CCSc) every student can engage actively in learning, but                       results are not guaranteed.  Teachers must learn how to use                     CCSs' as pedagogical tools.                                                                                                                                     Objectives: provide substantive data on the benefits of CCSs                    in various educational environments; show how CCSs can be                       adapted to various pedagogies to enhance the effectiveness                      of the learning environment; quantify the effects of these                      adaptions on student performance.                                                                                                                               Research: Scientist-teachers from eight national programs                       will test Classtalk CCSs' capabilities in research                              classrooms.  Feedback from pilot research at these test-                        sites will help optimize the tools and interface.  In the                       principal effort, test-site researchers will do controlled                      evaluations of CCS impact on their own pedagogical                              frameworks.                                                                                                                                                     Anticipated Results: We will learn how to use CCSs                              effectively under various classroom pedagogies and what                         software tools make CCSs maximally effective                                                                                                                    Applications: Successful CCSs are cost-effective tools                          enabling all students to engage actively in learning.  CCSs                     help identify students' preconceptions and diagnose                             fundamental misunderstandings.  CCSs may incorporate video                      and other technologies, improve students' motivation, and                       help teachers to track and assess student learning.",
