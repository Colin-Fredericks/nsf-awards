 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research into the dynamics of large-scale, low frequency               phenomena of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system has an emphasis on             planetary scale motions with time scales ranging from weeks to                  years.  The four main areas of this research are:                                                                                                               (I)  The annual cycle of the low-latitude coupled ocean-atmosphere              system:  Mounting evidence indicates that the annual cycle plays an             integral role in the longer period, interannual variability of the              coupled ocean-atmosphere system.  The annual cycle itself is a                  complicated combination of interactive, large amplitude asymmetric              (monsoon) and symmetric (Walker) components.  If these components               are out-of-phase, as appears to be the case, then certain types of              interaction may be expected.  Therefore, the interactive structure              of these components will be investigated with a combination of                  diagnostic and modeling techniques.                                                                                                                             (II)  Equatorial Wave Propagation in Inhomogeneous Flows:  Earlier              studies indicate that equatorial transients are significantly                   modified by the latitudinal and longitudinal structure of the basic             flow.  Both the sign and latitudinal shear of the basic flow tend               to determine the degree of equatorial trapping and lateral                      extension (emanation) of the transients while the longitudinal                  stretching deformation determines the degree to which transient                 modes are trapped longitudinally.  This research will be expanded               from the past studies by explicitly including the strong vertical               shear found in the tropical atmosphere.  This research will also                take advantage of the more complete ECMWF 31-level global                       operational model now available.                                                                                                                                (III)  Interhemispheric and Extratropical-tropical Interaction:                 Abundant evidence exists to show  that extratropical modes                      influence the tropical regions or even extend to the other                      hemisphere through the equatorial westerly duct regions.  Further               theoretical studies in this area will use conservative potential                vorticity on an isentropic surface (IPV) as a basic tool in an                  exhaustive diagnostic investigation of regional equatorial                      propagation.  A pilot study appears to identify new phenomena and               unexplained processes which may have considerable relevance in                  latitudinal interactions.                                                                                                                                       (IV)  Rapid Development of Ultra-long Equatorial Anomalies:                     Tropical Bursts and Surges:  A common view of the tropics is that               the large scale fields are weak and slowly varying and that only                small scale convective disturbances have rapid development.                     However, a contrary view is suggested by new analyses which show                that rapid development appears to occur on the largest scales,                  thousands of kilometers, especially in the warm pool regions of the             tropical Indian and Pacific oceans.  A combined diagnostic and                  modeling activity, aimed at understanding these tropical bursts and             their role in the coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions, will be                undertaken.                                                                                                                                                     Research in each of these four areas will proceed first with                    detailed diagnostic studies which will be used to pose hypotheses.              Then the hypotheses will be tested by experimentation with a                    hierarchy of theoretical numerical models.  This approach has                   proven to be very successful in past research.                                                                                                                  This research is important because it focuses on understanding the              behavior of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system on time scales of               weeks to years.  This understanding is key to determining whether               the coupled system is predictable on time scales of months to                   years, one of the specific scientific goals of the TOGA (Tropical               Ocean Global Atmosphere) Program which is aimed at studying the                 prediction of climate phenomena.",
