 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to perform a task which involves a choice of right                  versus left depends upon connections between the two sides of the               brain.  These connections are carried by a bundle of nerve fibers               called the corpus callosum.  in this award Dr. Noonan will                      investigate the effects on right-left discrimination of surgical                disruption of the corpus callosum and selective damage to various               areas of the neocortex which are interconnected by the corpus                   callosum.  His previous work has shown that surgical disruption of              brain pathways which interconnect the two hemispheres can actually              improve right-left differentiation and this award will explore more             precisely the anatomical localization of that phenomenon.  Many                 aspects of the research will be performed by undergraduate                      students, who will receive valuable experience in basic scientific              work.  This research will contribute to understanding the brain                 processes which are responsible for mediating spatial information               that allows an individual to navigate successfully in the                       environment.",
