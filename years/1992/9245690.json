The ecology of the arctic                          regions is extremely fragile and susceptible to stresses                        caused by economic development and global climate change.                       The meeting is being organized by Dr. David Murray of the                       University of Alaska at Fairbanks and Academician Vladimir                      Sokolov of the Institute of Evolutionary Animal Morphology                      and Ecology of the Russian Academy of Sciences.                                                                                                                 This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the United States and Russia to combine complementary                           efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual                              interest and competence in the field of basic scientific                        research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and                             mutuality of benefit.",
