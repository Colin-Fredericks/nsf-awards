Based                        upon this preparation, the staff will develop and field test                    three spreadsheet modules for delivery of high school                           physics content.  During the spring of 1992, a summer                           institute will be planned for 20 well-prepared high school                      physics teachers.  The teachers will be selected from school                    in the state of South Dakota and the 150 mile region                            surrounding the University of South Dakota.  These teachers                     will be brought to campus for a two-week 1992 summer                            institute.  The institute, presented by the project staff,                      will consist of training in the use of microcomputers,                          spreadsheet software, data acquisition devices, and                             communications software.  The 20 teachers will practice with                    the instructional modules developed by the project staff and                    will study instructional strategies appropriate to the use                      of computers in physics instruction and learn physics                           content using spreadsheets.                                                                                                                                     The 20 teachers will use the instructional modules and the                      instructional strategies during the 1992-1993 school year in                    their own high school physics instruction.  They will be                        provided consultative support by the project staff by way of                    phone, mail and electronic mail.  The 20 teachers will also                     be encouraged to communicate among themselves via the same                      methods.  Three regional meetings, hosted by one of the                         participating high schools and conducted by two of the                          project staff, will be used to support the trained teachers                     and to inservice other physics teachers in each region.                         Feedback about the effectiveness of the instructional                           modules and the instructional strategies will be obtained                       from the participating teachers.                                                                                                                                Cost sharing equals 37% of the NSF award.",
