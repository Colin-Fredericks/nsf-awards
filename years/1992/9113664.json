 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ongoing research program is concerned with some of the                physical processes and structures that occur in thin electrical                 current sheets and plasma boundary layers in the Earth's                        magnetosphere, with special emphasis on the magnetopause.  This                 current sheet forms the outer boundary of the magnetosphere and                 separates it from the rapidly streaming solar wind.  The proposed               research is centered in three areas.  The first of these is                     concerned with the development and testing of data-analysis                     methods for single-spacecraft data that can be used to examine                  the two-dimensional or three-dimensional structure of the                       magnetopause itself as well as the geometry of bulges, or                       deformations of the magnetopause, caused by magnetic flux                       connection across the current layer (so-called FTEs) or by                      dynamic-pressure pulses in the solar wind.  The data to be used                 in this part of the study were obtained by the AMPTE/IRM                        spacecraft.  The second area concerns the development of analytic               and numerical models of one-dimensional current sheets                          representing so-called intermediate shocks which are dissipative                and rotational discontinuities, which are nondissipative.  Both                 of these types of magnetic and plasma structures have been                      proposed to represent the magnetopause during periods of magnetic               field reconnection.  The third area of study is the reconnection                process itself and the manner in which it may be initiated and                  grow in the region near the subsolar magnetopause.  Analytical                  theory, as well as numerical simulation methods will be employed.",
