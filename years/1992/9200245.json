 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigations of persistent atmospheric flow anomalies have               found that high frequency transient eddies play an important role               in maintaining anomalies against downstream propagation.  The                   precise way in which these transient eddies affect the onset and                decay of the anomalous patterns remains a question.  For example,               the onset of anomalies is often associated the upstream                         intensification of synoptic-scale disturbance )storms), but it is               not clear whether this intensification occurs in a background                   environment neutral or stable with respect to large-scale eddies or             as a consequence of large-scale instability.                                         A diagnostic technique has been developed that allows                      examination of the forcing of the slowly-varying large-scale flow               in terms of both low frequency and high-frequency transient eddy                processes.  It has been applied to perpetual January data from a                two level general circulation model.  Results indicate that the low             frequency processes typically, thought not always, determine the                local growth or decay of anomalies.                                                  Under this award, the principal investigators will apply this              diagnostic technique to the output form a sophisticated model, the              Community Climate Model of the National Center for Atmospheric                  Research, and compare the results with those of the previous study.             This research will enhance our understanding of the causes of                   intraseasonal climate variability.",
