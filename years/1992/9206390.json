 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sharks, rays and skates are able to detect extremely                            weak electromagnetic fields and use this sense to                               capture their prey, since all living animals produce                            natural electric fields.  Sharks also use this ability                          for navigation in the open seas by using the earth's                            magnetic field as a frame of reference.  These special                          organs which act as \"ears\" for sensing weak                                     electromagnetic fields are long, jelly-filled tubes                             within the sharks's bodies.  Although these organs have                         been studied for years, little attention has been given                         to the jelly, itself, and it has usually been considered                        to be a filler substance without much importance.                                                                                                               The major objective of this research is to test the idea                        that the jelly material in the shark organs plays a                             major role in their ability to detect electromagnetic                           fields.  If this notion is correct, a better                                    understanding of how sharks detect their prey is                                anticipated.  Furthermore, the results of these studies                         may be important for human health concerns in relation                          to the controversy about whether high-voltage power                             lines may cause cancer in nearby residents.  If this                            suspicion is correct, it would suggest that certain                             molecules or cells in the human body are sensitive to                           electric or magnetic fields.  A better understanding of                         how the shark organ jelly responds to electromagnetic                           fields may provide clues into the ways in which such                            fields may affect humans.",
