Why                do some work hard on their school subjects while others get                     involved in other activities, including problem behaviors?  Do                  these activity choices related to the educational, vocational,                  and family options they pursue in their early twenties?  This is                a longitudinal follow-up to an existing large scale data set.                   These investigators have developed a theoretical framework to                   investigate such questions and have used this model to study                    during the ontogeny of education and role-related choices during                adolescence in a sample of 2380 youths.  This project follows                   this sample as they make the transition into adulthood and will                 assess the utility of the framework for predicting adult role                   choices and look at the long term sequelae of adolescent behavior               patterns and social experiences.  Two type of data will be                      collected.  A telephone interview will be conducted, and data                   will be merged with questionnaire data collected with other                     support.  These data will then be used to test basic theoretical                predictions.",
