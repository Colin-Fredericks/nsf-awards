 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the project is to obtain sufficient knowledge of               the pathway(s) for the biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)               and the mechanisms for the interconversion of free and bound IAA                to understand how the plant controls its endogenous level of growth             hormone.  An in vitro enzymatic system has been developed for the               synthesis of IAA and tryptophan from indole at a rate commensurate              with the in vivo rate.  The system is sufficiently stable to permit             enzyme fractionation and characterization.  The enzyme that                     catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of the conjugates of               IAA has been purified to homogeneity.  The gene for the enzyme has              been cloned in E. coli.  This gene will be sequenced for comparison             with genes for other auxin binding proteins and other enzymes of                auxin metabolism.  These results should facilitate the isolation                of enzymes of auxin metabolism, permit studies of the genetic                   regulation of the auxin conjugation system, and ultimately permit               development of anti-sense techniques to further understand the role             of the auxin conjugation-hydrolysis system.",
