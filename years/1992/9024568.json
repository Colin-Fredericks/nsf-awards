 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award for a long term visit to the United Kingdom will                     support collaborative research in geometric analysis and                        differential geometry between Steven Rosenberg of Boston                        University, K.D. Elworthy of the University of Warwick, and                     T. Lyons of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.                                                                                                              The investigators propose to apply probabilistic and classical                  geometric methods to problems in differential geometry.  They                   will study Riemannian manifolds and their applications to                       topology and geometry of manifolds.  Three problems will be                     investigated: (1)  The Hopf conjecture for the Euler                            characteristic of negatively curved manifolds; (2) a method for                 extending Bochner's and Myers' theorems for positively                          curved manifolds; and (3) a method for yeilding soft                            eigenvalue estimates for the Laplacian using a modification of                  the Fukaya method.  The later problem will be developed with                    Dr. T. Lyons of the University of Edinburgh.  Manifolds are                     a fundamental concept in many areas of mathematics and                          physics.  This collaboration offers an innovative approach to                   studying these problems by combining the complementary                          expertise of the U.S. and British investigators in classical                    differential geometry and in probability respectively.",
