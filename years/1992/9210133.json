 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS) was                 formed in 1988 to identify and bring together the distributed                   human and facilities resources of the academic research community               with the purpose of advancing knowledge and understanding of the                Arctic to meet national needs.  Specifically, ARCUS serves as a                 forum for planning, facilitating, coordinating, and implementing                disciplinary and interdisciplinary studies of the Arctic; acts as               a synthesizer and disseminator of scientific information; and                   encourages and facilitates the education of scientists and the                  public in the needs and opportunities for research in the Arctic.               Today ARCUS has 21 member institutions from 17 states.                                                                                                          The main activities ARCUS proposes to undertake as part of this                 effort are:  (i) establishment and support of an ARCSS Project                  Office and (ii) the organizational and business systems                         development of ARCUS.                                                                                                                                           The specific TASKS of the ARCSS Project Office would include:                   (a)  providing support to the ARCSS Integrating Panel, (b)                      providing support for the OAII Science Steering Committee, and                  (c)  providing support for the LAII Science Steering Committee//",
