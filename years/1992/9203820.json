 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stable isotope and chemical analyses of fluid inclusions provide                important geochemical constraints on the formation conditions of                minerals in a variety of geological environments.  Hydrogen and                 oxygen isotope measurements have been made of inclusions in                     optically transparent hydrothermal ore and gangue minerals like                 quartz, adularia, fluorite, and sphalerite.  No one, however, has               reported stable isotope analyses of fluid inclusions in native                  metals.  There are a few published papers and abstracts (all in                 Russian) that address inclusions in native metals.  In one abstract             Petrovskaya et al. (1974) report that 0.1-1.5 mm inclusions,                    containing CO2 as a major constituent, are common in some native                gold.  Beyond such simple but important observations, however, the              literature is to all intents and purposes devoid of information on              the subject.  Native metals, while not of widespread occurrence,                should be among the best mineral repositories for environmental                 fluids.                                                                         Stable isotope analyses of inclusions trapped in gold will provide              valuable insights into (1) the environmental conditions of native               gold formation and related processes of ore deposition, (2)                     possible geochemical differences between inclusion fluids trapped               in different cogenetic hosts, (3) past continental climates, and                (4) variation of the oxygen isotope composition of ocean water                  through geologic time.",
