 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study various questions relating to                  the existence, stability, and numerical approximation of                        solutions of certain models of compressible fluid flow.  Previous               work concerning one-dimensional and spherically symmetric flows                 will be extended to general multidimensional flows and to models                for chemically reacting flows and flows involving phase                         transitions.  Two long-range goals of the project are: first, to                prove the global existence of solutions of the Navier-Stokes                    equations for compressible flow with large, discontinuous Cauchy                data; second, to understand solutions of these equations in the                 one-dimensional case, with Riemann initial data, in terms of                    solutions of the corresponding Euler equations for inviscid                     fluids.                                                                              The mathematical models studied in this project attempt to                 predict the behavior of fluids which may react chemically so as                 to ignite, and fluids in which both the liquid or gaseous states                may be present simultaneously.  The design and development of                   computer methods for numerically solving the model equations is                 greatly facilitated by a rigorous mathematical understanding of                 why solutions do exist and in what sense, and how sensitive these               solutions are to the initial state of the system.  The primary                  goal of this project is to provide this rigorous mathematical                   understanding of the mathematical models; a secondary objective                 is to apply these mathematical results to the design, testing,                  and analysis of computer algorithms for generating approximate                  solutions.",
