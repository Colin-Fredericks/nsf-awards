Such an understanding comes through both                             analytical modeling and experimental testing.                                                                                                                   The multiaxial testing devices and data acquisition                             system requested will allow for the physical analysis of                        a broad array of materials including concrete, rock,                            composite materials, and soil.  Within the cubical test                         cell these materials may be subjected to variable and                           independent levels of stress along any of the principal                         axes.  This variable and independent loading is what                            makes the test cell superior to conventional stress                             analysis along a single axis and therefore more accurate                        when used to predict behavior over the life of a                                particular material or composite.  The proposed equipment                       will be used for testing engineering materials under                            uniaxial, biaxial, or triaxial compressive loading                              conditions.  The devices consist of a cubical steel frame                       and six walls which function as lids.  The load is                              applied via a hydraulic pressure system whose                                   polyurethane membranes and pressure seals contain the                           fluid pumped into the system.  The deformation of the                           specimen is measured with a proximitor probe system.                                                                                                            This work is proposed to find basic constitutive                                properties and the stress-strain relationships of tuff                          rocks (from Yucca Mountain, Nevada) under multiaxial load                       histories.  Yucca Mountain located near the southwest                           margin of the Nevada Test Site (NTS) in southern                                Nevada, as show in Figure 1, is being evaluated as a                            potential site for underground disposal of nuclear waste.                       Yucca Mountain primarily consists of layered volcanic                           tuff (Bish et al., 1981).  The Topopah Spring Member of                         the Paintbrush Tuff has been tested (under uniaxial and                         two dimensional loadings) and reported by References                            (Olsson and Jones, 1980; Price, Nimick, and Zirzow, 1982;                       Price, Spence, and Jones, 1984; Price et al., 1985;                             Nimick et al., 1985; Nimick et al., Price 1986) for                             physical, thermal, and mechanical properties as part of                         the Nevada Nuclear Waste Storage Investigations (NNWSI)                         Project, which is administered by the Nevada Operations                         Office of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  Figure 1                        shows the geographic locations of NTS, Yucca Mountain,                          and Busted Butte, Figure 2 the stratigraphic setting of                         the Topopah Spring Member, and Figure 3 a measured                              section of the tuff exposures at the sample location.                                                                                                           There is a need for quantitative methods to predict the                         environmental impact of excavating operations so that                           preventive and remedial measures can be taken to reduce                         or eliminate adverse impact.  The overall objective of                          this proposed study is to develop models as quantitative                        predictive tools to improve the capability of accurately                        predicting probable subsidence resulting from underground                       excavating.  The specific tasks of this study include:                                                                                                                1.  To compile all available relevant data.                                     2.  To develop constitutive and failure models for                        discontinuous tuff rock based on available uniaxial                             and triaxial compression test series on Topopoh                                 Spring tuff rocks which have been reported in these                             Refs. (Olsson and Jones, 1980; Price, Nimick, and Zirzow,                       1982; Price, Spence, and Jones, 1984; Price et al., 1985;                       Nimick et al., 1985; Nimick et al., Price 1986) and other                       References.                                                                           3.  To conduct laboratory testing of new core                             samples and make determination of mechanical properties                         of tuff rock materials under multiaxial load histories.                               4.  To develop the finite element computer                                simulation model to analyze the basic behavior of the                           underground opening field, including behavior of                                individual underground opening field, movement of the                           overburden formation, and dislocation movement between                          the top of the cavern field and the overburden                                  formations.  By using the finite element computer                               simulation model, the causes of the probable damage will                        be analyzed and appropriate measures to prevent such                            damage will be recommended.",
