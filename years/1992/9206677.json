 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators study two different but synergistic areas                of applied mathematics: neural networks and population genetics.                The neural network studies are based on Voltage Controlled                      Oscillator model Neurons (VCONs), which are constructible                       electronic devices that have interesting mathematical models and                many parallels with physiological nerve cells.  The investigators               have recently derived VCON networks that filter, process, and                   store information based on frequency encoding; they extend and                  refine this work in parallel with known physiological circuits.                 The mathematical aspects of interest in this are rotation vectors               and generalized Fourier analysis of dynamical systems.  The                     applied aspects are related to the design and study of circuits                 that can reproduce known functions of parts of mammalian brains                 based on frequency encoding and decoding.  Specifically, the                    investigators study tonotopic mappings, storage and retrieval of                messages, and the structure and function of processing circuits                 similar to neocortical columns.  The second part of this proposal               studies populations and genetics.  The investigators focus on                   food chains and colony synchronization in bacterial communities,                pattern formation in bacterial lawns, and plasmid stability in                  genetically engineered microorganisms.  Computational methods                   developed for simulation of VCON networks are applied to study                  bacterial communities.                                                               The project involves two problems in mathematical biology                  that illustrate two important contributions that mathematics                    makes to the life sciences: First, mathematics enables us to                    analyze large networks that resemble parts of our brains, and                   second, mathematical formulations enable us to use scientific                   computers to predict the outcome of experiments that are                        expensive or difficult to perform.  First, the investigators                    study large collections of electronic devices that mimic brain                  circuits.  These devices (called VCONs) are based on phase-locked               loops that are widely used in electronic communications.  They                  have designed, analyzed, and simulated VCON networks that focus                 attention on the most persistent among many competing stimuli,                  and that memorize and recall messages.  They extend this work to                include other aspects of the brain, including parts of the                      hippocampus.  The novelty of this work is that it is based on                   frequency encoded information rather than discrete information                  bits, as in digital computers.  As a result, the networks are                   quite stable, even functioning well when partially destroyed.  In               the second part of this work, they use methods developed for VCON               networks to study problems about bacterial communities.  While                  these two problem areas are widely separated, certain                           mathematical aspects of the two are remarkably similar: Bacteria                lead oscillatory lives, and using the methods for large networks                of VCON oscillators, the investigators are able to describe in                  mathematical terms large communities of bacteria -- for example,                as arising in soil.  In addition to working on problems that are                similar between the two areas, they study problems specific to                  bacterial genetics, including how stable are genetically                        engineered variations in bacterial cell lines.",
