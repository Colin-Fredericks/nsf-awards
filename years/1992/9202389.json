The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support an eleven-month postdoctoral research visit             by Dr. Flynn W. Picardal of the University of Arizona to work                   with Dr. Alexander J. B. Zehnder of the Swiss Institute for Water               Resources and Water Pollution Control (EAWAG).  Their research                  project will study the effect of environmental factors on the                   acclimation period which precedes the biodegradation of mono-, di-              and trichlorobenzenes by a microbial population.  The factors to be             examined include choice  of substrate, substrate concentration,                 presence or absence of co-substrate, and temperature.  Experiments              will utilize microcosms containing soil, water and/or sediments to              examine the interspecies or interstrain movement of genes encoding              known degradation pathways.  Chlorobenzenes are being used as                   model compounds in these studies because the biochemistry and                   genetics of chlorobenzene degradation have already been                         elucidated.  Pseudomonas sp. Strain P51 will be used as a donor                 organism to provide a source of genetic sequences capable of                    chlorobenzene degradation.  This recently isolated organism (van                der Meer et al, 1991) has been shown to have chlorobenzene                      biodegradation genes grouped into two clusters.  The                            chlorobenzene dioxygenase gene for this organism has been shown                 to be located on a transposable element.  Mutations and genetic                 rearrangements in the population will be stimulated through the use             of known chemical and physical mutagens and other methods.                      DNA hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)                           techniques are among those that will be used to study genetic                   movement and acquisition of new genetic material.  The frequency                and extent of such movement will be examined as a function of the               varied environmental factors.                                                                                                                                   The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a stipend for eleven months.",
