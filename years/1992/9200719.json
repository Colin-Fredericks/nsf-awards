 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop new and more                   efficient numerical algorithms with applications to quantum field               theory, the statistical mechanics of critical phenomena, and                    related problems in applied mathematics.  The research focuses on               three principal application areas: Monte Carlo simulation of                    lattice spain models and field theories; solution of large linear               systems of equations with disordered coefficients; and Monte                    Carlo simulation of self-avoiding random walk.  The principal                   algorithmic strategy is to employ \"collective-mode\" updates, such               as multi-grid, auxiliary-variable, embedding and generalizations                thereof.  Some of these algorithms are motivated by techniques                  used in the numerical solution of elliptic partial differential                 equations, but novel adaptations are required.  The methodology                 involves a combination of heuristic physical reasoning, rigorous                mathematical analysis, and systematic numerical testing.  One                   principal project is to continue the development of the multi-                  grid Monte Carlo method, with emphasis on lattice gauge theories.               A second project is to develop multi-grid algorithms for large                  linear systems with disordered coefficients; examples are the                   lattice fermion and Faddeev-Popov propagators in a background                   gauge field.  In addition, the group plans to continue its                      investigations of collective-mode algorithms based on auxiliary                 variables (Swendsen-Wang and its generalizations), collective-                  mode algorithms based on embeddings (Wolff and its                              generalizations), and algorithms for the self-avoiding walk.                         Efficient numerical algorithms are necessary to exploit                    adequately new computational technologies.  This research effort                will have impact both on computational mathematics and physics.                   //",
