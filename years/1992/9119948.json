 "awd_abstract_narration": "The manner in which food web structure regulates the size of                                                                                               animal populations is currently receiving much theoretical and                  empirical attention..  This proposal seeks to develop a                         mechanistic understanding of the strength of interactions in a                  food web consisting of fish, invertebrate predators, and two                    anuran larvae.  Indirect effects mediated through this food web                 are central to changes in relative success of the two anurans                   along the environmental gradient from permanent to temporary                    ponds.  The food web interactions are approached at several                     levels ranging from individual behavior to large scale food web                 manipulations to build from mechanisms to an understanding of                   community phenomena.  A focus of the proposal is an experimental                                                                                                evaluation of the importance of higher order interactions                       generated by behavioral responses of prey to the presence of                    their predators.  These higher order interactions alter the                     nature of competitive interactions among prey in the absence of                 any direct mortality effects of predators on prey.  Because of                  the widespread occurrence of behavioral responses of prey to                    predators, such higher order interactions are likely important in                                                                                               many ecological systems.  The behavioral responses of the anurans                                                                                               in turn are mediated by growth (competitive ability)-risk                       tradeoffs, one through activity levels and the other through                    habitat choice.  Theory at the individual behavioral level will                 be developed, tested and used to provide a theoretical basis for                                                                                                understanding the community consequences of adaptive individual                 behavior.  Both of these tradeoffs are relevant to interactions                 in many taxa.  Finally, because behavioral responses are often                  functions of individual size, the work will explore ontogenetic                 constraints on behavioral expression and the consequences to                    species interactions.",
