 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has become a cliche to describe events of the past four years                as having created a historical turning point of virtually                       unparalleled proportions.  The liberation of Eastern European                   nations by its own citizens, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the              Persian Gulf War, and the emerging economic union of the European               Community have transformed the Cold War international system.  But              it is much less clear how the United States will react to the                   challenges, constraints, and opportunities of the new era; a                    retreat to neo-isolationism or a leadership role in creating and                sustaining institutions and regimes for coping with a wide array                of international issues are only two of the many possibilities.                 Whatever choices the United States makes will have a significant                impact on the post-Cold War world order.  These choices will be                 influenced by many factors, including the political beliefs of                  American opinion leaders.                                                                                                                                       This project seeks to gain reliable and systematic evidence about               the domestic and foreign policy beliefs of American opinion leaders             representing a wide range of institutions, including corporations,              labor unions, government, the media, the military, churches,                    universities, etc.  To do so the project will conduct a mail survey             of approximately 4,000 opinion leaders whose names have been drawn              from Who's Who In America, Who's Who of American Women, and similar             directories.                                                                                                                                                    The survey, to be conducted in the spring of 1992, will be the                  fifth in a series of studies of American opinion leaders undertaken             by the investigators.  Each of the previous surveys, undertaken in              1976, 1980, 1984 and 1988, yielded responses from over 2,000                    opinion leaders.  This unique body of data provides a strong                    baseline from which to measure the impact of the dramatic events                since 1988 on the political attitudes and beliefs of Americans who              are well positioned to play an influential role in the public                   dialogue about the appropriate international role for the United                States in the 1990s and beyond.                                                                                                                                 The results of the 1992 survey will be made avaliable to the entire             social science community and will be an invaluable source for                   interested students of American foreign policy.",
