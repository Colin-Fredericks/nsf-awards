 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is              in the field of chemistry.  For a three-year period beginning April             1992, ten (10) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks                 engaged in basic research under the direction of the faculty                    members in the Chemistry Division.  By design, the scope of the                 research projects within the chemistry department extend from basic             scientific research for theoretical advancement to applied research             on system design and technological development.  Most importantly,              the research opportunities for the NSF-REU undergraduate                        participants will encompass all of the major disciplines of                     chemistry; Inorganic, Organic, Physical, Analytical and                         Biochemistry.  The range of projects that would be available to                 participating students include a full range of chemical,                        theoretical, biophysical and instrumentation approaches to the                  advancement of polymer science.  Our plan is to place great                     emphasis on matching the students with mentors who have similar                 scientific interests.  Several department members are involved in               joint research projects with scientific colleagues at Kodak, Xerox,             Bausch and Lomb, IBM, Mobil Corp. and Fisons Pharmaceuticals.  The              students will have an opportunity to benefit from these                         professional collaborations through on-site seminars, plant                     visitations and possibly even future research internships.  Our                 ultimate goal is to motivate all participants in the summer                     research program to pursue scientific excellence.",
