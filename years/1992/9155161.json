 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Roman City,\" fourth in a series of PBS specials based on the                   acclaimed books of David Macaulay, is an hour-long film that                    traces the planning, engineering, building and habitation of an                 ancient Roman city at the height of empire.  The program                        continues the unique Macaulay presentation format of a                          cinemaquality animated dramatic story juxtaposed with live-                     action documentary segments, hosted by Mr. Macaulay and filmed                  at actual sites portrayed in the story.  Each film roots its                    dominant structures and technology firmly within the thought and                culture of its historical period.  The dual presentation style                  has enabled the previous Macaulay specials to capture a wide                    range of viewers from young children all the way up to older                    adults.                                                                                                                                                         \"Roman City,\" as well as the previous award-winning Macaulay                    specials--\"Castle,\" \"Cathedral\" and \"Pyramid\"--is specifically                  aimed at enhancing the scientific, technical and humanistic                     understanding of both young people and adults outside of the                    formal educational environment.  All indication from the                        previous programs suggests that this goal has been widely                       achieved.  There is a natural curiosity about other cultures,                   about things technical and how they interrelate with human needs                and aspirations, and we believe our unique format satisfies that                curiosity in an entertaining, informative and educational                       manner.                                                                                                                                                         The ancient Romans achieved breakthroughs in planning and the                   delivery of those elements deemed necessary for the functioning                 of an increasingly world.  Aqueducts, sewers, roads, bridges,                   amphitheaters and public buildings, even public lavatories, all                 speak to the technical mastery of the ancient Romans.  And if                   their social aims were not always as \"advanced\" as their                        scientific and technological sophistication, then that, too,                    provides a modern object lesson on the critical and mutually                    dependent interrelationship of science and civilization.",
