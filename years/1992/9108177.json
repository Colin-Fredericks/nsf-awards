 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compositional data arise naturally in several branches of                  science, including analytical chemistry, geology, biology,                      medicine, ecology, and manufacturing design.  Hence, constrained                data are not observed solely in the atmospheric sciences.  However,             such data are routinely produced in atmospheric chemistry, where an             adequate understanding of such data is often critically important               to the environment. To optimally extract the information that is in             such data, there is need to go beyond the application of                        established statistical techniques.  Some attention should be                   focused on the development of new statistical methods that are                  motivated by characteristics that are especially common in                      atmospheric chemistry data sets.  As was eluded to above, one such              characteristic is the presence of a constant-sum constraint, which              may have been inherent to the data or imposed by the chemist.  A                collection of statistical methods for handling such data, based                 principally on log-normal models, has been developed.  This project             will investigate the use of new parametric and nonparametric                    approaches to significantly improve this existing methodology.  In              the parametric setting, an extension of some recent work by the                 principal investigators will be used with a practical regression                model to address problems.  In the development of the nonparametric             approach, minimum distance methods, coupled with multivariate                   bootstrap techniques, will be used to suggest point and region                  estimators and other associated problems is proposed.",
