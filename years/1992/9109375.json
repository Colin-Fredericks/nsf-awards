 "awd_abstract_narration": "Appropriate development and maintenance of the connections                      and metabolism of neurons are necessary requisites to all                       functions of the nervous system, including the processes of                     learning and memory and other cognitive abilities.  Knowledge of                the substances that regulate these processes in mature neurons                  and during development is limited.  However, two classes that                   have been implicated in the development, survival, and                          regeneration of neurons in cerebral cortex, the brain region                    involved cognitive functions, are the steroid hormone, estradiol,               and the locally-synthesized growth- and survival-promoting                      protein, nerve growth factor (NGF).  Indeed, Dr. Toran-Allerand                 has demonstrated that neurons of cerebral cortex contain                        receptors for both estrogen and NGF.  She will now investigate in               parallel the developmental history of the co-expressed estrogen                 and NGF receptor systems in vivo and analyze the cellular and                   molecular consequences of estrogen/NGF interactions in vitro.                   The results of this work will provide insights into those factors               that may be of importance to the development of brain regions                   which underlie cognitive functions.  Moreover, the basic                        information gained from this work may ultimately provide a                      biological rationale for clinical investigations into possible                  therapeutic approaches involving both estrogen and NGF in                       Alzheimer's disease and related disorders of cognition.",
