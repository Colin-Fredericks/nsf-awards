This office was                     established late in 1990 and has as its fundamental objective to                assist the U.S. science community in meeting STEP science                       objectives.  The U.S. components of STEP include the facilities                 and projects of NSF, NOAA, NASA, and USAF.  These components                    consist of spacecraft, ground-based, rocket, balloon, and theory                and simulation programs capable, in the collective sense, of                    studying the complete set of coupling mechanisms that are                       responsible for the transfer of energy and mass from one region                 of the solar-terrestrial system to another: GEM, CEDAR, ISTP/GGS,               UARS, CRRES, ISY, MAX91, GOES (and associated data available on                 SELVAX), and suborbital programs.  The USSCO interacts with these               and other domestic programs and with those responsible for                      accomplishing the detailed international science objectives of                  STEP for the purposes of: coordinating joint compaigns for data                 acquisition and data analysis which meet national and                           international science objectives; collecting and disseminating                  STEP-related information; and, organizing professional society                  meetings and special sessions.  The activities of the USSCO are                 significant in that they enhance and expedite the scientific                    process within the STEP context by identifying and implementing                 opportunities for synergistic endeavor.",
