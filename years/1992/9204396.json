 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore the synthetic potential of several                    important radical processes: the fragmentation of cyclopropyl                   and cyclobutylcarbinyl radicals; the generation, inversion and                  cyclization of dioxolanyl, oxiranyl, and aziridinyl radicals.                   These latter functionalized radicals can be generated from                      readily available chiral precursors that will lead to                           enantiomerically pure compounds.  Dioxolanyl, oxiranyl, and                     aziridinyl radicals have not been the subject of extensive                      study and in the case of the latter two, all but ignored as                     potential chiral reactants in chemical synthesis.  In addition                  to the synthetic potential of these processes, interesting                      mechanistic questions have also been posed.  The success of                     these studies will provide new avenues of synthesis that may be                 applicable to the preparation of important antibiotics through                  pathways inaccessible by anionic and cationic methods.  Modern                  methods of chemical analysis, i.e., nuclear magnetic resonance                  and mass spectroscopy, will be used in the identification of                    the new materials prepared in this work.                                        %%%                                                                             With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                 research of Dr. Frederick E. Ziegler at Yale University.  The                   research explores new synthetic methodology based on free                       radical based reactions that could replace the more well                        developed anionic and cationic based methodology.",
