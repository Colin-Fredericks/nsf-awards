 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study proposes to investigate how computer and                        communications technology can influence teaching and learning                   paradigms in engineering education in the next decade.  Recognizing             that (1) pedagogical models for engineering education have remained             relatively unchanged for almost half a century and that (2)                     advances in computer and communication technology make possible the             restructuring of the way engineering education is delivered, this               study will explore and contrast the ways in which technology can                facilitate the delivery of engineering education.  The focus of the             project is on how technology permits more rapid and comprehensive               delivery of engineering education, for example, by using                        multimedia, distance education, intensive simulation experiences,               virtual realities and teamwork experiences.  An emphasis is placed              in this study on understanding the relationship between predicted               technology capabilities and how these capabilities can influence                pedagogical outcomes.  Data are to be secured from both academic                and industrial groups and multiple scenarios are to be evaluated in             order to make recommendations about how public policy should be                 formulated to best influence future directions in engineering                   education.",
