 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phase behavior of small-molecule amphiphiles in solution and                well-defined block copolymers in the strong segregation limit is                strikingly similar.  However, a unified molecular-based                         understanding of this phenomenon is not well developed.  Since                  constraints defined by the molecular architecture dramatically                  influence phase behavior, a molecular-based description of ordered              fluid microstructures is clearly required.  The research is                     intended to further the understanding of the crucial molecular                  parameters that govern condensed-phase microstructure.  This                    involves the design, synthesis, and characterization of two                     new families of macromolecular architectures.  These architectures              will be constructed by covalently linking stiff-dendritic                       macromolecules with linear flexible chains.  The design of these                architectures relies upon considerations taken from both small-                 molecule amphiphiles and block copolymers.  One of the unique                   features is that the architectures incorporate a stiff-dendritic                segment whose geometry is precisely defined.                                                                                                                    The insight gained from these studies will enhance the discovery of             new polymeric materials with bicontinuous phases.  Since                        bicontinuous phases have potential for controlling transport                    phenomena, the research also has technological significance.",
