 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate modeling and simulation of manufacturing and other                complex systems is often hampered by the amount of detail required              for a representative modeling effort and the amount of data that                needs to be analyzed in order to understand the results of the                  simulation.  This situation is further complicated when the system              under study is subject to dynamic behavior.  The purpose of this                research is to explore the use of abstraction in simulation                     environments and to support their use in ways that may allow a                  dynamic change in the level of detail of the model.                                  This research awards the development and use of an abstraction             mechanism with three layers of functionality as a means of modeling             and simulating large, complex systems.  Since current simulation                models cannot vary the level at which they are aggregated without               a significant amount of reprogramming, this approach will provide               an innovative way to make the amount of detail intellectually                   manageable.   Ultimately, the researcher plans to achieve this goal             by creating abstract objects dynamically that hide the unnecessary              details of the original objects.  The feasibility of the approach               is to be tested with the development of a prototype system.",
