 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of efficient packet routing algorithms is a very                important task in the construction of parallel computers.  In a                 parallel architecture, different computing elements must be able to             communicate with each other fast while the size of the message                  (packet) queues created during the routing must be bounded, ideally,            to a small constant.  Through packet routing, real machines are able            to simulate idealized machines and theoretical models can be tested             and tuned.  Up to now, the best existing permutation packet routing             algorithm on the mesh architecture is by Leighton, Makedon and Tollis           which routes the packets to their destination in optimal time and with          constant size queues.  However, drastically new methodologies are               needed to make these results practical.                                                                                                                         Two types of parallel communication algorithms will be considered,              online and off-line on multidimensional meshes and tori.  Off-line              packet routing is used in cases where the communication pattern is              known in advance, before the execution, or for computations in which            the data dependencies are fixed before run-time.  Universal                     approximation algorithms for packet routing on meshes and tori will             also be examined for completing the routing in the cases of actual              problems.  A universal approach is also needed in the case of off-line          routing, that can be applied to any pattern, such as many to one                routing.",
