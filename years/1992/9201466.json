 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will attack the problem of the isometric                  classification of hyperbolic metrics on a given 3-dimensional                   manifold, as well as study the topology of limit sets of such                   metrics.  These two problems involve understanding the geometry of              geometrically infinite ends of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  The                     approach which he plans to use is based on the technique of pleated             surfaces in hyperbolic manifolds.  He intends to develop a calculus             for pleated surfaces which will enable him to obtain estimates on               their geometry and the speed at which they converge to infinity in              the 3-manifold.                                                                      It is a surprising fact that although we live in a three                   dimensional space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so are blessed with              a natural intuition about such geometric objects, in the end this               does not carry us as far as we might have expected,for questions                which have been settled by algebraic calculations for higher                    dimensional manifolds still remain baffling in the 3-dimensional                case.  The most famous of these is the celebrated conjecture of                 Poincare from around the turn of the century concerning 3-                      dimensional spheres, where precisely the original 3-dimensional                 case is the only one still open.  The investigator is pursuing a                variety of questions about 3-dimensional manifolds with slightly                strange notions of distance on them, so-called hyperbolic metrics,              but time and time again these questions have been shown to have                 clear relevance to the case of manifolds with a more familiar                   notion of distance.",
