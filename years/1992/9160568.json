 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this work is to design x-ray optics                              for the collection and redistribution of the annular                            x-ray cone generated by transition radiation such                               that a uniform x-ray spot is delivered at high power                            density to a mask/wafer target.  This will increase                             the power density from the existing 1 mW/cm2 to 5                               mW/cm2 permitting transition radiation to be a                                  competitive source for x-ray lithography.  Transition                           radiation is emitted in conical annulus which has a                             central hole in the radiation pattern and more than                             half of the x-rays are emitted at angles larger than                            the angle of peak intensity.  Hence, efficient                                  collection of the x-rays and their proper collimation                           into a uniform beam area on the size of the mask                                and wafer target areas are required for uniform                                 exposure of x-ray photoresist of microintegrated                                circuit production.  We will demonstrate feasibility                            of using Kumakhov x-ray optics to collect and                                   collimate x-rays from a transition radiation source                             over a angular range of up to + 30 mrad and to                                  provide a quasiparallel beam suitable of x-ray                                  lithography.  The desired intensity uniformity across                           the output x-ray beam is 3% .  A complete design                                of a Kumakohov lens based on computer simulation                                and on experimental results with single capillaries                             and polycapillaries and their correlation with                                  theoretical predictions will be done.",
