 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                  will help the Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University                  acquire an entire new integrated single crystal x-ray                           diffractometer and structure analysis system, with rotating                     anode generator and low temperature capabilitities.  Among the                  areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the                         acquisition are the following:                                                                                                                                  1. The Bioinorganic Chemistry of Oxo-Bridged Dinuclear Iron                        Proteins                                                                     2. Structural Investigations in Heteropolyanion Chemistry                       3. New Categories of Heteropoly Complexes and New Insights                      4. Structure and Reactions of Novel Nitrones and Their Metal                       Complexes                                                                    5. Mixed-Valence Ruthenium Dimers Involving Less-Effective                         Cross-Bridge Electronic Interaction                                          6. Orientation-Dependent Chemistry on Molecular Crystal Surface                 7. Sterochemical Control of Vitamin B-12 Functionality                          8. Chiral Columns and Channels from Discotic Mesophases                         9. Magneto-Structural Correlations in Di- and Trinuclear                           Imidazolate-Bridged Complexes of First-Row Transition                           Metals                                                                                                                                                       %%%                                                                                                                                                             Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful                       analytical method for structure determination of solids.  In                    synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic                   chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable                    tool to characterize molecular structure.  The information                      gained from the knowledge of the intermolecular composition and                 structure helps to develop new reactions of potentially general                 interest in catalysis or organic synthesis.",
