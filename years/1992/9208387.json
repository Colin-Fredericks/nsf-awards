 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                    Chemistry Program will support continued studies by Professor                   R. H. Holm of Harvard University in several areas of                            bioinorganic chemistry.  Areas to be investigated include 1)                    molybdenum oxotransferases including synthesis of analogues and                 isotopic labeling studies of rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase; 2)                  synthesis of models for the cofactors of nitrogenase; 3)                        functional models of the nickel enzymes hydrogenase and CO                      dehydrogenase.  In all analogue studies emphasis is on                          synthetic models that provide functional mimics of the enzyme                   action.  In a less biologically related area investigations of                  the synthesis of molecular chalogenide clusters from soluble                    thiometallates and by excision of fragments from insoluble,                     nonmolecular solids will be undertaken.                                         %%%                                                                             The nature of many enzymes is such that precise molecular                       structures and mechanistic details cannot be determined by                      conventional physical techniques.  A variety of indirect                        methods have evolved that can be used to infer enzyme                           structures and to help define the individual chemical steps                     involved in their catalytic mechanisms.  The application and                    development of these indirect methods is the purpose of this                    research.",
