 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the present proposal is the                                    development of some mathematical and computational                              tools that are appropriate to the next generation of                            CACSD (Computer Aided Control System Design)                                    environments.  These future CACSD packages will be                              radically different from the present packages in that                           they will truly be able to perform control systems                              synthesis and rapid prototyping, rather than just                               analysis and simulation.  A key role in this is played by                       the integration of modeling, system identification, and                         robust control design.  The long range goals address                            the following problems: (i) estimation of model                                 accuracy from measured and prior data, (ii) tuning of                           the identification experiment for robust controller                             design, (iii) development of reliable and efficient                             algorithms, and (iv) development of an interactive                              object oriented environment which is sensible for a                             wide variety of users.  Phase I of the proposed research                        is directed towards the feasibility of solving these                            problems.  Phase II will extend the results of Phase I as                       well as develop the corresponding software primitives.",
