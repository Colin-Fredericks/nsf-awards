 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although mechanized induction is relevant for science and                       technology, standard methods, such as similarity-based learning,                are seriously limited for learning hard concepts from poorly                    understood domains.  Several important domains, such as protein                 folding, would benefit from more advanced treatment of data and                 partial knowledge to construct new features that help similarity-               based learning.  The goal of this project is to improve methods                 for feature construction, using increased interaction between                   computer and user to take advantage of the strengths of each.                   Two thrusts of this project are more dynamic construction and                   more interactive refinement.  For dynamic construction, the                     problem of constructing representations is decomposed into                      several subproblems for forming and selecting components for new                features.  Components are dynamically determined by information                 contained in automated analysis of data and knowledge.  For                     interactive refinement, the approach allows partial specification               of \"hunches\", which can represent domain-dependent or independent               heuristics.  These fragments of knowledge can be updated by the                 learning systems and re-examined by the user.",
