 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research described here is to develop theories for aqueous                  solvation of proteins.  Simple continuum solvent models are                     insufficient to describe phenomena such as hydrogen-bonding,                    orientation of water dipoles, and interactions involving                        separations of only a few water layers.  The three main                         objectives of this project are to develop analytic molecular                    theories of solvation, to use these theories to develop new methods             for treating solvent effects in molecular dynamics simulations, and             to study the solvation of a specific protein, rubredoxin.  While                the straightforward approach is to include water molecules in                   computer simulations of proteins, this becomes impractical as the               size or number of proteins and other molecules increases.  The                  approach here is to employ integral equation theories which predict             the molecular structure of liquids but with much less computation               than simulation methods.  These theories can be used to calculate               the net forces on the protein due to the solvent.                               %%%                                                                             Theories for solvent effects on macromolecules are crucial to                   developing theoretical methods to probe the structure, dynamics and             thermodynamics of biopolymers.  Specific, current problems for                  proteins to which these theories can be applied include folding,                enzyme-substrate binding, and electron-transfer in and between                  proteins.",
