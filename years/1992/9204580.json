 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. E. Wyllys Andrews, Mr Clifford T.                    Brown will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will                  conduct excavation and survey at the Post Classic Mayan site of                 Mayapan which is located in Yucatan, Mexico. His project builds                 on previous work at the site which resulted in extensive mapping                and excavation. This has shown that Mayapan was a very large and                very densely settled community surrounded by a massive wall over                9 km long. Outside the ceremonial center of the site, several                   thousand structures, the majority of them apparently residential                in function, have been located. These appear to be subdivided                   into geographicaly distinct groups. Mr. Brown will excavate in                  carefully selected areas of the site in an attempt to understand                spatial patterning in artifact type. He will dig in 2 meter                     squares and collect what are likely to be large samples of                      ceramics, stone tools and faunal remains. Because of their                      plastic nature, ceramics are often reveal fine levels of                        stylistic variation. Mayapan is particularly important because                  early Spanish settlers described the site and Yucatec-language                  documents are also available. These sources will aid                            significantly in the interpretation of the archaeological data.                                                                                                 Mr. Brown wishes to understand how large Mayan sites such as                    Mayapan functioned. How were large numbers of people subdivided                 into smaller groups, what patterns of interaction were observed                 and how were people governed? While much work has been conducted                on the impressive ceremonial centers at Mayan sites very little                 is known about how communities functioned. On the basis of                      historic documents Mr. Brown has formulated a series of                         hypotheses and the archaeological materials to be collected will                provide the data to test them.                                                                                                                                  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to a large number of archaeologists. It will                   shed new light on the emergence of complex societies and will                   assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
