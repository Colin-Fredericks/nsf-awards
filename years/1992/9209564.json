 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Bureau of Economic Research Summer Institute brings                together economists from universities, government and                           international organizations for a few days or a weeks of                        seminars, workshops, conferences, and collaborative research.                   Last year's Summer Institute included 709 economists from 179                   universities.  A similar number is expected to attend this                      summer.  Special efforts are made to include younger and less                   well known economists.                                                                                                                                          The Summer Institute is organized into 12 programs: economic                    fluctuations, monetary economics, corporate finance, asset                      pricing, industrial organization, health and aging, international               studies, labor studies, productivity, and taxation.  Each                       program has its own group of participants and its own structure.                Although there is considerable variation among the programs, a                  typical Summer Institute will last for one to three weeks, with                 seminars each morning and afternoons devoted to individual                      research.  Programs may include a variety of subjects or they may               be organized around specific topics.                                                                                                                            The Institute provides a unique opportunity for economists to                   work closely with others in their areas of specialty for extended               and intense periods research.  Although numerous conferences                    permit researchers a few hours in which to exchange ideas, only                 this institute lasts long enough to allow for serious                           collaboration among economists from different institutions.                     While research nearing completion is presented, the major                       emphasis is placed on testing new ideas by presenting preliminary               research and developing ideas and plans for joint or coordinated                research efforts.",
