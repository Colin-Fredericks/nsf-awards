 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is widely recognized that population pressure is one of the                  most important sources of environmental degradation, especially                 in developing countries.  What is less fully appreciated is the                 impact of environmental quality on people's motives for having                  children.  This project focuses on the implications of parents'                 desire for children and concern with the children's future well-                being for the dynamic relation between population and                           environment.  The project also investigates whether a system of                 taxes on children and subsidies to parents can be welfare-                      improving for members of the present generation and what affects                such tax/subsidy policies may have on the dynamics of                           demographic/environmental interactions.  The relation between                   population and the environment in developing countries is also an               important part of the human dimensions of global change because                 environmental degradation in developing countries causes global                 warming and because continued high rates of population growth in                developing countries will make it increasingly difficult if not                 impossible to reconcile goals for economic growth with the                      protection of the environment.                                                                                                                                  The research is both theoretical and empirical.  Specifically, an               agricultural input demand systems model is derived, specified and               estimated.  This model includes age- and gender- specific labor                 demand equations.   The empirical research relies on Burkina Faso               Survey Data and Pakistan Survey Data.  The former data set                      contains very detailed information on agricultural production in                Burkina Faso over the period 1981 through 1985, including the use               of household and hired labor, by age and sex, for a wide variety                of agricultural activities.  The latter data are representative                 of poor households in three distinct agroecological zones in                    Pakistan and provide very detailed information on the                           socioeconomic and agricultural characteristics of these families.",
