The focus                              of this workshop is the relationship between                                    architectural design and seismic strengthening:                                 the unique design problems created, the                                         architectural concerns generated by conflicting                                 requirements, and issues raised in construction,                                and the impact these changes in the built                                       environment have on occupants and on the                                        surrounding community.                                                                                                                                          While past efforts have been focused specifically                               on damage assessment and strengthening design,                                  this workshop looks at the architectural                                        implications of seismic strengthening and its                                   effect on completed buildings, as well as the                                   context for design policy changes.  Among the                                   American and the Italian participants, the                                      architects and engineers will address the question                              of how retrofit is accomplished, while the                                      planners and policy researchers will ask if retrofit                            can be accomplished socially and politically.",
