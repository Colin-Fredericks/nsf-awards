 "awd_abstract_narration": "High speed optical links are finding ever increasing uses in                    optical communications and signal processing applications.                      Currently available planar waveguide lasers used in these links                 suffer from a high insertion loss due to a mode mismatch between                the fiber and the modulator and the inability to implement a 2D                 array configurations.  The vertical cavity surface emitting                     lasers (VCSEL) currently under development at several U.S.                      labs address these problems.  These VCSEL devices consists of a                 quantum well Fabry-Perot cavity sandwiched between n and p doped                high reflectivity mirrors.  Vertical cavity lasers, however                     suffer from a high contact resistance due to a doughnut shape top               electrode.  This leads to increased heat and current crowding in                the laser.  We propose to eliminate this problem by depositing a                transparent top electrode made from single crystal GaN.  GaN is                 transparent to IR and visible and forms a ohmic contact to heavy                doped GaAs.  The Phase I program will determine if the VCSEL is                 damaged during the GaN deposition and measure the improvement in                the top contact resistance.  This will be followed by developing                2D fiber pigtailed VCSEL modules with monolithic detectors in                   Phase II.                                                                                                                                                       Anticipated Benefits:  The proposed VCSEL modules and the                       developed technology form the basis of several high speed                       modulator, laser and optical interconnect devices.  These offer                 unique system architectural possibilities for future DOD and                    commercial systems.",
