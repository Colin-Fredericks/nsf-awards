 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants have evolved a battery of physical and chemical defenses                 which protect them against grazing damage (herbivory).  Most of                 our understanding of herbivory and plant defenses derives from                  research on mature leaves.  However, young expanding leaves are                 the most vulnerable stage during the life of a leaf.  Eighty                    percent of the lifetime damage occurs during this short window,                 because expanding leaves suffer 10-100 times the rates of damage                from fungi and herbivores as mature leaves.  We are interested in               understanding the effectiveness of young leaf defenses, and the                 interactions among defenses.  In particular, we hypothesize that                rapid leaf expansion, which reduces the vulnerable period, is                   incompatible with other defenses such as toughness, chemical                    defenses and greening.  Although chemical defense and rapid                     expansion are the two most effective defenses for young leaves,                 synthesis of chemicals during leaf expansion may cause auto-                    toxicity as well as compete for resources used in rapid leaf                    construction.  Species which have slowly expanding young leaves                 may therefore rely more extensively on effective chemical                       defense.  We will characterize the chemical defense profiles of                 fast- and slow-expanding young leaves in rainforest plants, and                 quantify the effectiveness of these chemicals as defenses against               insect herbivores and fungal pathogens.                                                                                                                         In addition to giving us insight into the ecology of this                       important interaction, the research will provide data on novel                  and effective chemical compounds.  Out of convenience, most                     screening for biologically active compounds has used mature                     leaves, even though this age-class is primarily defended by                     toughness and tannins.  Since young leaves are tender, they rely                primarily on defensive chemicals to protect them from herbivores.               We predict that the types of chemicals found in young leaves will               be mobile, effective in small concentrations and of small                       molecular weight, all attributes that make them much more                       tractable for medicinal and agricultural development.",
