 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modeling of the geochemical carbon cycle and its effect on                      atmospheric CO2 over Phanerozoic time (Berner, 1990;1991) has                   revealed the importance of knowing more about how land plants                   affect chemical weathering.  This includes the effect of plants on              the rate of uptake of CO2 by silicate and the feedback response of              weathering, with and without plants, to changes in CO2.  This                   project will investigate the role of plants in weathering by a                  field study on the island of Hawaii.  Hawaii offers a unique                    opportunity to study weathering because here there are:  (1) dated              basalts ranging back to more that 4000 years (2) a wide range of                plant life, from lichens and algae to well developed rainforest,                within small regions of constant bedrock lithology and constant                 microclimate and (3) access to the expertise of biologists who are              presently studying plant ecology in the same area.  We plan to                  measure the thickness and mineralogical and chemical composition                of weathering rinds and soils on flows with an eye to comparing                 relative rates of weathering in the presence and absence of                     specific biota.  Results of this work, when combined with results               from planned future studies of the effects of specific plants grown             at varying CO2 levels on weathering rate, will be employed on our               carbon cycle model to place some limits on how atmospheric CO2 might            have changed as a result of the rise of vascular plants over                    geologic time",
