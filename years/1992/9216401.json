 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) effort.                The research is a contribution to the theory of non-linear                      simulation, to the theory of adaptive human interfaces and                      intelligent interface agents, and to the theory of human-computer               interaction.  Episodic transitions occur during human-computer                  interaction and in systems in related fields including biolog, the              physical sciences and the behavioral sciences.  For examples, the               transition from one focus of attenstion to antoher is an episodic               transition between homeostatic states of selkective attention.                  These \"phase transition\" behaviors may be triggered by a variety                of events such as completion of a cognitive subtask or by external              interrupts.  The present research is to develop tests for the                   hypothesis that critical phase transitions are governed by a                    conservation law called the lae of \"conservation of affordance..\"               Affordances are expressions of system needs which are dynamically               created and annihilated through the perturbation and subsequent                 restoration of homeostatic conditions.  Affordances constitute the              linking of behaviors of various parts of the system that normally               operate at different time scales in order to achieve behavioral                 goals.  Affordance is modeled mathematically by two oppowsing                   sources in a non-conservative energy flow on embedded Hamiltonian               manifolds.  This mathematical formulation provides an explicit                  theoretical basis for dynamic engines in use on the domain of                   human-comupter interaction and elsewhere.  In particular it                     provides a portable computational modules that support the                      conservation law.  A set of simulations will be developed useing                this mechanism whcih can support modeling of higher order functions             such as perceptual simulation issues.  An important anticipated                 result is that the correct use of these mechanisms will make                    possible sensory encodiung and data fusion for artigificial                     syustems to permit the capture and understanding of rare and novel              events.  The interface and modularity ussues have conseqwuences for             interoperabbility, software capitalization adn the flexibily                    sharing of research results between groups of investigaotors.",
