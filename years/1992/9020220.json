 "awd_abstract_narration": "Families of maps generated by periodically forced                          oscillators undergo a rich and fascinating set of bifurcations.                 The investigator proposes to develop new numerical and analytical               tools to further investigate the bifurcations of these forced                   oscillator systems.  Current numerical \"continuation\" routines                  are able to trace out one-parameter curves of local bifurcations                of fixed and periodic points for orbits of low period, typically                less than four or five.  Proposed work will include development                 of new routines that are expected to trace out bifurcations                     curves for higher period orbits.  These new \"high period\"                       routines will then be used for locating \"global bifurcations,\"                  where invariant manifolds, typically a stable one and an unstable               one, become tangent before crossing.  Once developed, these                     routines will enable a much more automatic and detailed                         bifurcation study, not only of maps generated by forced                         oscillators, but also of any two-parameter family of maps.                           Many processes in science and engineering can be                           mathematically categorized as \"forced oscillator systems.\"  One                 example of an oscillator is a pendulum, because it swings back                  and forth, or oscillates.  We usually think of a pendulum as                    having a fixed support (the nail in the wall to which the string                with a weight is tied), but if we keep moving the location of the               support, we say the pendulum is being \"forced;\"  if we move the                 support in a repeating pattern, such as back and forth, then we                 have a \"periodically forced oscillator.\"  It turns out that the                 resulting motion depends critically on how fast the support is                  moved back and forth (the forcing frequency) and how far it is                  moved back and forth (the forcing amplitude).  Fairly simple                    mathematical models also exhibit this same behavior, including                  the sensitivity to changes in \"parameters\" analogous to forcing                 frequency and amplitude.  Changes in the qualitative behavior of                the system (how the pendulum bob moves) that occur as the                       parameters are varied are called \"bifurcations.\"  Much is known                 about these bifurcations, but much is still unknown.  The                       investigator proposes to fill in some of the missing gaps in this               area.  Results will help explain observed behavior in any process               that can be classified mathematically as a forced oscillator                    system.",
