 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide supplementary support                                   to enable Dr. Glen Kwon of the University of                                    Utah to conduct collaborative research with Dr.                                 Teruo Okano for 16 months at the Institute of                                   Biomedical Engineering, Tokyo Women's Medical                                   College, in Tokyo, Japan.  Kwon and Okano will                                  apply Kwon's knowledge of polymeric                                             microspheres and controlled delivery systems to                                 conduct research on polymeric micelles as a                                     drug carrier for adriamycin.                                                                                                                                    Colloidal drug carriers, such as polymeric                                      microspheres, liposomes, and soluble polymeric                                  carriers, have been developed to increase the                                   efficacy of drug action in vivo.  The                                           disadvantages of these systems, however,                                        preclude their ability to increase the                                          therapeutic index of many drugs.  A new drug                                    carrier synthesized of polymeric micelles has                                   been developed in Japan and has proven to                                       increase the efficiency of adriamycin without                                   the problems associated with the other methods.                                                                                                                 Leading-edge research on polymeric micelle drug                                 delivery systems is advancing quickly in Japan,                                 and Okano's laboratory is one of the best.                                      Kwon's knowledge of pharmaceutics and                                           controlled drug delivery systems involving                                      proteins and polypeptides complements Okano's                                   expertise in synthesizing polymeric micelles.                                   This collaborative research will provide Kwon                                   with first-hand knowledge of the Japanese                                       approach to novel polymer synthesis methods and                                 applications of biomaterials as drug carriers.",
