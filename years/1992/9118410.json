 "awd_abstract_narration": "This laboratory recently found that the relative rate of signal-             mediated transport through the nuclear pores, as well as the                    functional size of the transport channel, decrease significantly                when proliferating 3T3 cells enter a period of growth arrest.  To               better understand the role of nuclear envelope permeability in                  regulating cellular activity, experiments are proposed to determine             1) if the growth-related effects on transport are limited to                    nonspecific changes (e.g., functional pore size), or whether the                specificity for different targeting signals is also affected, 2)                whether the size restrictions that limit nuclear uptake in growth               arrested cells also apply to nuclear efflux, 3) if the observed                 permeability changes are due to alterations in cell shape,                      modifications in the composition of the pore glycoproteins, or                  variations in the activity of cytoplasmic transport factors, and                4) if growth factors are involved in the modulation of signal-                  mediated nuclear transport.  In order to analyze nuclear transport,             cultured cells will be injected with either various size colloidal              gold particles coated with proteins containing nuclear localization             signals, or fluorescent-labeled BSA conjugated with different                   targeting sequences.  Uptake into the nucleus will be analyzed by               electron or fluorescent microscopy.                                                                                                                             Communication and protein movement between the nucleus and the                  cytoplasm of an interphase eukaryotic cell is crucial to the cell's             ability to regulate such fundamental cellular processes as protein              synthesis,  gene expression, and cell cycle.  Movement of proteins              and nucleic acids back and forth across the nuclear envelope is                 known to take place at discrete specialized structures called                   nuclear pores.  At least some materials move specifically through               pores via a system of \"targeting sequences\" and receptors which                 recognize and facilitate such movement, although the detailed                   mechanism(s) by which these transport phenomena occur remain                    unknown.  This project will contribute significantly to                         understanding of the complex nature of nuclear targeting.",
