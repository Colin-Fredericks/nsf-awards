 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this US-Poland research project between                        Dr. Robert T. Siegel of the College of William & Mary and                       Dr. A. Adamczyk of the Institute of Nuclear Physics,                            Cracow, Poland is to calculate a complete set of those                          muonic differential cross-sections which are relevant to                        muon catalyzed fusion and weak interaction physics.  The                        planned calculations are based on the development of                            numerical methods for estimation of the molecular binding,                      spin correlations, and electron screening effects in the                        scattering of muonic hydrogen atoms on hydrogen molecules.                      The numerical methods for these calculations were                               developed over many years in Poland.  As a result of the                        project, the researchers plan to complete an altas of the                       up, ud and ut mesic atom scattering cross sections on the                       ground and excited states of all the molecular targets of                       hydrogen isotopes H2, D2, and T2.  These results will                           provide the final information necessary to the detailed                         analysis of already performed and planned experiments by                        an experimental collaboration between William & Mary, PSI                       (Switzerland), IMEP (Austria) and Munich (Germany).                                                                                                             This project in physics fulfills the program objective of                       advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts                      in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                              complementary talents and pool resources in areas of                            strong mutual interest and competence.",
