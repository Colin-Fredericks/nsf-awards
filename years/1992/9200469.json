 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a renewal grant for ongoing simulation studies of quantum               many-body systems.  Improved techniques and computing power will                enable progress to be made on several more difficult and complex                problems.  Detailed studies will be made on the structure and                   phases of helium films, the structure and excitation energy of a                quantized vortex, and the fluid and solid phases of helium-four                 very close to the melting-freezing transition.  A new Fermion                   algorithm will be applied to study the fluid phase of helium-three              and prior calculations on the momentum distribution and condensate              fraction of helium-four will be improved using new sampling                     techniques and improved wave functions.  A new study will be                    initiated on the ground and excited states of a helium-three                    impurity in liquid helium.  An attempt will be made to construct a              general approach to quantum mechanical soft potential problems                  based on hard-core modeling and a suitable perturbation approach to             the remainder of the two-body potential.  The formalism will be                 developed for the path integral method of simulating quantum                    systems at finite temperatures.                                                 %%%                                                                             The ongoing research project will focus on the computational                    simulation of important problems concerning helium in its liquid                and solid states.  This is a difficult and very fundamental problem             since quantum mechanical effects are not small for these systems.               In order to deal with these computationally intensive problems, new             computer techniques will be developed.",
