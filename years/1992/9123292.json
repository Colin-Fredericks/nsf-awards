 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of new and synthetically useful reactions based                 upon cation radical catalysis is planned.  The advantages and                   attributes of these new reactions will be investigated by means                 of thorough study of their selectivity profiles and mechanisms.                 Extremely sensitive mechanistic probes for the cation radical                   intermediates involved in catalyzed reactions have been                         designed and will be further quantitated and perfected.  These                  probes will permit the definitive detection of these catalytic                  mechanisms, in general, where these are operative.  The full                    scope of this powerful, new catalytic principle can thus be                     defined.  The involvement of a catalytic mechanism in                           biological and enzyme model catalyzed epoxidation will be                       examined using these probes.  The involvement of radical cation                 catalysis in, or its relationship to other biological oxidation                 reactions will also be examined.                                                                                                                                %%%                                                                                                                                                             With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will continue to                 support the research of Dr. Nathan L. Bauld at the University                   of Texas.  The research explores new ramifications and                          applications of the chemistry of cation radicals.  It will                      generate new methodology that should benefit research in                        biochemistry and medicine as well as in the chemical industry.",
