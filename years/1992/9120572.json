 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports visits over a three year period by Dr. David                Bodznick of Wesleyan University and Dr. Mark Nelson from the                    University of Illinois to the laboratories of New Zealand                       colleagues Dr. John Charles Montgomery at the University of                     Auckland and Dr. Michael Geoffrey Paulin of the University of                   Otayo.  The Dorsal Octavolateral Nucleus (DON) is the structure                 located in the medulla of elasmobranch fishes which filters                     electrosensory signals as they enter the brain.  In this project                advanced signal processing and computer simulation techniques                   will be used to characterize and analyze the function of the DON                in terms of detailed circuity.  By combining the skills and                     resources of the four investigators with diverse backgrounds the                study anticipates improving the understanding of the DON and                    similar brain structures in other vertebrates, and also how                     mathematical and computer methods can be applied to analyze                     neural structures.  The expertise of Dr. Paulin (mathematician)                 in computer modelling in neurophysiology and Dr. Nelson (physics)               in biophysics and neural information processing will be                         integrated with the ongoing collaborative studies previously                    initiated by Drs. Bodznick and Montgomery in electrosensory                     systems and elasmobranch physiology.",
