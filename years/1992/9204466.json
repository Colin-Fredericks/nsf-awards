 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective is to understand the molecular mechanism of             imprinting, the marking of chromosomes as being of maternal or                  paternal origin.  The study of imprinting should help answer basic              questions about inheritance and gene regulation during development.             I propose to examine the feasibility of using embryonic stem (ES)               cells undergoing X chromosome inactivation as a model system for                imprinting.  ES cells, derived from mouse embryos, can grow in                  tissue culture, and by simple changes in growth conditions, the                 cells can also be induced to undergo differentiation in vitro.  ES              cells are known to form two layers as they differentiate into                   embryoid bodies, an endoderm-like outer layer, and an ectoderm-like             inner layer.  I propose to use ES lines which are heterozygous for              a number of X-linked genes, and an allele-specific assay for                    specific RNAs to characterize X-inactivation in these cells.  I                 propose  1) to characterize X-inactivation in the inner ectoderm                layer and the endoderm layer, 2) to investigate large scale methods             of separating the two layers for biochemical analysis, and 3) to                analyze whether DNA methylation patterns found in mouse embryos are             preserved in ES cells.  In addition, I propose to study the                     distribution of a transcript, termed Xist, recently discovered to               be synthesized only from the inactive X chromosome.  I propose to               use in situ hybridization and PCR-based assays to learn more about              the role of Xist in cases where the paternal X chromosome is                    preferentially inactivated.                                                     %%%                                                                             The mystery of how a chromosome is marked as being either from the              mother or the father should begin to be solved by the development               of this system and the results of these experiments.",
