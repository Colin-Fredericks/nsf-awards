 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Minority Research Initiation project in the Chemistry                   Division, Edwin Carrasquillo M. of the University of Houston                    will study quantum state-resolved collision dynamics involving                  polyatomic molecules which contain chemically significant                       amounts of vibrational energy.  The combination of direct                       excitation using a single-photon overtone vibration to prepare                  a molecule in a specific quantum state, together with                           laser-induced fluorescence as a spectroscopic probe, allows the                 temporal evolution of a hot molecule to be monitored.  Various                  hydrogen-containing molecules, such as HCN, DCN, HCP, and                       propynal, will be studied in order to extract relaxation                        mechanisms and identify general trends.                                         %%%                                                                             Studies of energy transfer involving very high vibrational                      levels are important for understanding many chemical processes,                 including reactions.  Knowing how the internal energy of a                      reactant affects the reaction path or how the excess internal                   energy of a product is redistributed as it equilibrates with                    its surroundings can help in efforts to control the course of a                 chemical reaction.  This project aims at examining the behavior                 of molecules with large but very precisely determined amounts                   of energy present in the vibrations of individual chemical                      bonds.",
