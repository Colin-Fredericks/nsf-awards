 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research conference proposal, the aim is to convene                a meeting of plant and animal scientists to present current                     findings and to discuss a broad range of issues that pertain to the             structure and function of plasmodesmata in the context of                       intercellular transport. Activity on plasmodesmata has recently                 intensified, and this meeting will serve to focus the current group             toward important issues, to attract new researchers into this area,             and to provide workers in related fields with an assessment of                  progress. The meeting proceedings are to be published in a                      compendium volume.                                                                                                                                              Intercellular transport of ions and small molecules in higher                   plants occurs through plasmodesmata. The fine structure of these                cytoplasmic links between adjacent cells has been under discussion              since the early days of electron microscopy, yet the plasmodesmata              remain a black box through which various substances move from cell              to cell. Recently, research on plasmodesmata has intensified. This              conference focuses on this new work and aims to provide scientists              working in this field with an opportunity to describe their work                and its meaning in the context of intercellular transport in                    plants.",
