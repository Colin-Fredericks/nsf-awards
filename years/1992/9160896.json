 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fine, ultrapure particles are desirable starting materials for                  production of high-performance advanced ceramic products.                       AeroChem has previously demonstrated the combustion synthesis                   of silicon nitride products from the reactants silane and                       hydrazine.  In this program, combustion synthesis of silicon                    carbide will be investigated.  The flav-flame burner to be                      used is the same as used in conventional hydrocarbon-air flame                  studies, and the flame appearance is quite similar.  Two major                  differences are that no oxygen is used in the flame synthesis                   of silicon carbide (or nitride) and the major product is a                      powder which must be separated from the coflowing product                       gases.  In the current study, AeroChem will investigate the                     preparation of silicon carbide via reaction of silane with                      acetylene on this flat-flame burner.  The major issue here is                   the formation of a pure silicon carbide product without the                     presence of either silicon or carbon contaminants.                              Thermodynamic calculations indicate that this can be achieved                   by operation in a narrow reactant ratio range near                              stoichiometric, where the yield of silicon carbide is                           calculated to be 100% based on the silane feed.  Experiments                    and further theoretical analysis will be pursued to confirm                     that a high-purity SiC product can indeed be produced at close                  to 100% yield.                                                                                                                                                  High quality silicon carbide powders have a large potential                     market in the preparation of advanced ceramic materials via                     sintering or hot pressing.  Present progress in production of                   advanced ceramics is currently limited by the unavailability                    of a US-made high quality powder.  In addition, the technology                  and understanding of combustion synthesis which will be                         developed in this program will be applicable to combustion                      synthesis of a wide variety of other desirable materials.",
