Optical circuitry is an emerging technology that has the                   potential for making major, if not revolutionary, contributions to              signal processing, communication and computing.  The I/UCRC on                  optical circuitry also called the optical circuitry cooperative was             founded in 1984 and is presently engaged in the study of optical                nonlinearities of semiconductors and organic compound; fabrication              and characterization of fast optical switching elements; growth of              novel MBE structures; theoretical and experimental studies of                   semiconductor lasers; investigation of optical interconnect systems             with free space diffractive elements and optical neural networks.                    At the present time 7 professors, 4 post doctoral fellows and              approximately 10 graduate students are involved in this research.               The Center has presently five members and will add a new DoD member             this year.                                                                           The Center also plans to support a woman undergraduate student             who will be working on the measurement of optical nonlinearities of             fullerene materials.                                                                 Additonal funding is provided by the U.S. Department of                    Airforce to obtain a membership in the Center.                                       The Program Manager recommends the University of Arizona be                awarded $50,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award             and $5,000 for one year with funds provided by the Women,                       Minorities, and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program,               and $50,000 for one year with funds provided by U.S. Department of              Airforce.                                                                            Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager                  and/or the Division of Director of the Engineering Education                    Centers Division will review the progress of the Center on a number             of renewal criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to                 which the university-industry interaction is developing; 2) the                 extent to which the support base is developing; 3) the extent to                which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is                satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the                next period of this continuing award.",
