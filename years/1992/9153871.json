 "awd_abstract_narration": "The techniques of mathematical modeling and simulation                     are changing the nature of both social decision making and                      scientific inquiry.  An essential feature of this change                        involves viewing complex, interconnected problems from a                        dynamic feedback systems perspective.  Today's students need                    a working knowledge of modeling, simulation, and system                         dynamics so that they are adequately prepared to become the                     scientists, engineers, and policy makers involved directly                      with problem solving.  We propose to study how students                         think about models and simulations with the aid of The                          Explorer, an interactive computer learning environment, and                     to see if the addition of system dynamics will work                             effectively as a scaffolding for the transfer of skills and                     understandings from one complex problem to another in a                         different knowledge domain.  We believe that integrating                        tools that aid in understanding complexity into science                         courses will provide the basis for a radically different                        approach to learning.  In this proposal we explore                              alternative ways of working with simulations and system                         dynamics.  This research has three components:                                                                                                                       o    Identifying and assessing the development of                                    modeling-specific cognitive skills, and the                                     student's understanding of the nature and function                              of a model.                                                                                                                                                o    Identifying and assessing the development of                                    higher order analytical cognitive skills, and the                               student's ability to transfer these skills through                              different subject domains.                                                                                                                                 o    Augmenting an existing model-based curriculum to                                facilitate implementation of the previous two                                   components.//",
