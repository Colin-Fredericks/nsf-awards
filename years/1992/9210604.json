 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several topics concerning parallel and distributed computing will be            investigated.                                                                                                                                                   1.  Assignment and Scheduling of Precedence Graphs:  The existing               parallel compilers for supercomputers rely heavily on the programmer            for running an application.  By gaining a better understanding of               assignment and scheduling issues, much of this process can be                   automated.                                                                                                                                                      2.  Sparse Certificates and Communication Networks:  Sparse                     certificates for graph connectivity (highly connected spanning                  subgraphs with relatively few edges) have been introduced as a useful           tool for communication networks.  Certificates for weighted graphs and          their utility in the design of reliable protocols will be explored.             These certificates, if employed properly in communication protocols,            could result in considerable savings in the amount of message traffic           generated.                                                                                                                                                      3.  Algorithms for Graph Connectivity:  A recent almost-linear time             algorithm for edge connectivity based on matroid theory will be used            to investigate questions pertaining to the vertex connectivity graphs           and digraphs, and the complexity of connectivity testing on parallel            and distributed models.  Efficient reductions and parallelizable                alternate methods will be considered as ways of solving these                   problems.",
