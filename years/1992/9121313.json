 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will probe both the thermodynamic and kinetic                      factors involved in the formation and decay of alkene triplet                   states and triplet biradicals. By combining conventional                        photochemical techniques such as product analysis and quantum                   yield measurements with laser flash and time resolved                           photoacoustic calorimetry, a complete decription of triplet                     state photochemical processes will emerge. By combining the                     experimental results with theoretical calculations, a thorough                  and fundamental analysis of intersystem crossing and the                        corresponding energy surfaces involved will be developed. An                    important outcome of the investigation will be a better                         understanding of biradicals, and new methods for their                          production will be suggested. The investigation will provide                    critical and definitive conformation of theories for                            intersystem crossing from triplet to ground state surfaces and                  the factors, such as spin-orbit coupling, which control these                   processes.                                                                      %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professsor Richard A. Caldwell at The                        University of Texas at Dallas. These studies will probe the                     basic nature of the intermediate states which occur in chemical                 processes. By measuring the way that these intermediate species                 absorb light and how much heat is involved in their formation                   and decay, it is possible to predict how other similar, and in                  some cases not so similar, processes will proceed. Such                         fundamental knowledge, which is obtained by using specially                     designed instruments which are able to record phenomena which                   occur on the order of billionths of a second, will be combined                  with the theoretical predictions from computer calculations to                  provide a complete description of the energy requirements for                   converting one molecule into another via the use of light                       energy. The information gained will be useful in a variety of                   applications which use light to induce rapid and efficient                      changes, such as those which occur during the processing of                     computer chips.",
