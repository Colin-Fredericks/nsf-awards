 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to create a computer networks laboratory  which                 will be an integral and essential part of a newly developed                     undergraduate computer networks course, aimed at students in                    both Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.  The computer                 networks course will cover both the theoretical and practical                   aspects of computer network design, implementation, and                         performance.  The laboratory will broaden the experience of                     undergraduate students with the actual development and use of                   computer networks.  The requirement to interrupt the operation                  of the network, and its associated computers, makes it                          impractical to use existing computer facilities for the                         networks.  In addition to its use by the undergraduate computer                 networks class, the laboratory will used in the undergraduate                   operating systems course and a future distributed systems                       course.  Electrical Engineering students can take the computer                  networks course as an electrical engineering elective and can                   also use the laboratory to work on design projects associated                   with computer networks.",
