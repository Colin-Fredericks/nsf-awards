To this point,                                     most attention to these educational reforms                                     has been given to precollege science and                                        mathematics education, but colleges and                                         universities must be involved if this goal is                                   to be reach.                                                                                                                                                    The goals of this project are to recruit and                                    retain students with disabilities in the                                        engineering and science programs at the                                         University of Washington.  The project                                          includes four components:  (1) A live-in                                        summer science program for secondary-level                                      students who have disabilities; (2) A                                           mentoring program for the participating summer                                  students that will rely heavily on year-round                                   computer-based interactions with scientists (                                   many of whom have disabilities); (3) A                                          \"diversity awareness\" program for university                                    faculty and staff and local pre-college                                         science teachers; and (4) An information                                        dissemination program that will include                                         outreach to science and math teachers in the                                    northwest region.                                                                                                                                               Materials for recruiting and retaining                                          students with disabilities will be produced                                     and distributed in a variety of forms --                                        videotape; audiotape; computer disks;                                           electronic files accessible over the Internet                                   network; and written brochures in standard and                                  large print, and braille.  A conference will                                    provide an opportunity for dissemination of                                     materials for recruitment/retention as well as                                  those developed specifically for the summer                                     program.  They will be adaptable for use by                                     other schools.                                                                                                                                                  The quarterly \"diversity awareness\" workshops                                   for faculty, staff, students, and local                                         science teachers,  are intended to increase                                     the awareness of barriers faced by students                                     with disabilities and to present creative and                                   practical approaches for providing access to                                    instruction and campus services to students                                     with disabilities.                                                                                                                                              Methods developed in this project will serve                                    as models for recruiting and retaining                                          students with disabilities in other colleges                                    at the University of Washington as well as on                                   other campuses across the country.",
