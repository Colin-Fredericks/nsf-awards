 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project attempts to develop a theoretical framework for                    analyzing different aspects of the internal organization structure              of large firms, as well as of contractual nexuses among firms.                  Particular aspects analyzed include: hierarchical delegation of                 authority to design (sub)contracts, the breadth and depth of                    hierarchies, planning and supervision activities of managers,                   organizational diseconomies of scale, transfer pricing mechanisms,              and the grouping of activities into different divisions.                                                                                                        The approach adopted is to suppose that information regarding cost              and market conditions is dispersed among different agents in the                organization, and that they can communicate with one another in a               restricted manner.  Managers act strategically with respect to                  their private information.  The organization is thus characterized              by a decentralized decision-making mechanism which strikes a                    balance between the advantages of adaption to location information,             and the disadvantage of control losses arising from managerial                  incentive problems.                                                                                                                                             The short-term goal of the research is to develop consistent                    theoretical models of the above mentioned aspects of organizational             structure.  In the long run these models should generate                        predictions regarding the connection between organizational                     structure, and more fundamental characteristics such as the nature              of technology, information structure, production scale, product                 demand, and product market competition.",
