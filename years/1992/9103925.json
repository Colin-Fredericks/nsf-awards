 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year funding of a three year continuing grant.              This research focuses on the development of a formal system, based              upon possibility thoery for the representation and manipulation of              uncertainity in expert systems.  The use of Possibility theory                  allows a natural representation of linguistic information as well               being an appropriate setting for handling partial matching.  One                emphasis of the research is the development of tools for the                    general representation of imprecise functional information.  Here               use is made of the ability possibility theory to interact with                  other knowledge representation formalisms such as default reasoning             and probability theory.  A second emphasis of this research is the              development of a tool to help in the validation of knowledge-based              systems containing uncertain information.  Particular attention is              paid to the discovery of potential inconsistencies in a knowledge               base.  The approach used is based upon the idea of reflecting back              on the input.  A very fundamental uncertainty principle is the                  specificity-correctness tradeoff.  What this principle says is that             in providing information we generally must make a tradeoff.  What               this principle says is that in providing information we generally               must make a tradeoff between being very specific and running the                risk of being incorrect or being unspecific and in turn assure                  ourselves of being correct.  In most expert systems one desires                 both correctness and specificity.  In this research the measure of              specificity is extended to environments in which their exists as                underlying similarity relation.  The significance of this research              is that it provides tools for builders of expert systems which can              be used to formally and systemically include uncertainty in their               systems.",
