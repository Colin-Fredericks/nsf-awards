 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study brings together different facets of capital management               policies.  Specifically, it investigates structural estimation of               investment, capital retirement, and exit decision rules of plants               using data from the U.S. cement industry.  The data available                   covers 1973-80 and spans the oil-shock period.  Because cement is               a very fuel intensive product, a marked increase in investment,                 capital retirement and plant closings in the cement industry were               observed during this period.                                                                                                                                    Compared to the existing empirical models of investment, the                    salient features of this project are that it allows for a more                  flexible adjustment cost function, endogenous capital retirement                and endogenous exit of plants.  Methodologically, a stochastic                  dynamic programming model within an iterative estimation procedure              will be solved numerically.  A sensitivity analysis will be                     conducted using the estimates obtained to quantify the responses                of investment, capital retirement and plant closings to changes in              demand and cost parameters as well as to policies such as the                   investment tax credit and depreciation allowances.",
