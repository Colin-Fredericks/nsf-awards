 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research consists of continuing work in three different                    areas: survey research which attempts to assess possible                        impediments affecting the ability of the remnants of the Soviet                 Union and Eastern Europe to adjust to the market; the behavior of               real estate prices and returns; and studies of the correlations                 between asset prices and their relation to underlying economic                  fundamentals.   Research regarding the heretofore communist                     economies will involve developing questionnaires and surveys                    concerning the expectations of future government interference in                the economy and the impact that such expectations may have on                   inhibiting entrepreneurial activity.  Indigenous entrepreneurial                behavior will be critical in determining the success of the                     transition to a market economy, and this work will represent an                 important first step in understanding the determinants of                       entrepreneurial behavior and the prospects of a successful                      transition.                                                                                                                                                     The second area of work will test for efficiency in the operation               of real estate markets and the forecastability of real estate                   prices and returns using methods that are guided by theory                      derived from structural models of the real estate market.  This                 work is at the border of structural modeling and the kind of                    modeling suggested by empirical finance.  The third area of work                is directly in the finance area and will involve extending                      previous work on the time series properties of long term interest               rates in comparison with those of stock prices and dividends.                   The work involves relating correlations among different asset                   prices and correlations among market fundamentals that underlie                 such prices.  Specifically, the implications of the information                 pooling model will be tested to see if its explanation of asset                 price co-movements is actually consistent with the data.  These                 two areas of research are important because they will shed light                on the operation of two markets critical to the performance of                  the U.S. economy, the capital market and the real estate market.",
