 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed program aims to study several classes of ceramics and             ceramic matrix composites, representing materials with different                mechanisms of toughening.  The objective is to discover why and how             fatigue cracks grow in monolithic ceramics where toughening is                  induced by crack deflection and/or grain bridging, such as in                   coarse and fine grained Al2O3 and grain-elongated Si3N4.  Other                 materials include the transformation and microcrack toughened                   ceramics such as PSZ and ZTA, the brittle fiber or whisker                      reinforced ceramic matrix composites such as SiC-whisker reinforced             alumina, and the ductile-phase toughened ceramic matrix composites              such as Al-toughened alumina.  Fatigue tests, together with                     microstructural characterization of the degradation of the                      crack-tip shielding (toughening) mechanisms behind the crack tip                and accumulated microstructural damage ahead of the tip, will be                used to study the micromechanism of cyclic crack-growth in these                materials.                                                                      %%%%                                                                            This research is designed to seek a fundamental understanding of                the mechanisms by which ceramics suffer cyclic fatigue failure.  A              number of ceramic materials, representing materials with different              mechanisms of toughening, will be used for this study.                          Microstructural characterizations together with fatigue tests are               used to study the micromechanisms of cyclic crack-growth in these               materials.",
