 "awd_abstract_narration": "The OH radical is central to the photochemistry of the                     troposphere, and measures of its concentration furnish an extremely             sensitive test of our knowledge of the chemistry.  Its detection,               however, poses a considerable challenge due to its very low                     concentration and possible interfering species.  At this time,                  there are several promising candidate methods, some ready for field             trials and others not yet developed.  SRI International will                    organize and host a workshop in early 1992 to assess current                    capabilities, discuss and thereby improve the experimental                      approaches, and consider intercomparison test.  HO2 detection is                not so difficult as HO detection but is also challenging, and                   discussion of its measurement using similar or variant methods will             also be included.   The workshop participants will include                      atmospheric modelers, researchers involved in field measurement and             the associated technique development, and experimentalists in                   chemical physics.  A report will be written describing the workshop             discussions, conclusions, and recommendations.",
