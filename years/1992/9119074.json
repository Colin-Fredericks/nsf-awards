 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ongoing research effort on job shop scheduling explores               three generic problems in the manufacturing industry.  The first                problem is to schedule products with bills of materials to improve              on-time deliveries of products.  The second problem pertains to the             scheduling of facilities capable of batch processing several jobs               concurrently, such as an oven or a plating facility.  Since these               facilities are often expensive and have long processing times, they             constitute bottlenecks in many manufacturing systems.  The                      scheduling of a flexible manufacturing cell (FMC) is the third                  problem for study.                                                                   The purpose of this research is to obtain an efficient,                    effective and consistent solution methodology for scheduling                    general job shops.  Through extensive collaboration, an                         optimization-based scheduling methodology using the Lagrangian                  relaxation technique has been developed.  The method has many                   positive features, and has been tested at the Development                       Operations shop of a major aerospace manufacturer.  The abilities               to handle bills of materials, batch facilities, and FMC's, however,             are of crucial importance for the method to be truly effective for              general job shops.  This research will thus advance the state of                the art and practice of scheduling methodology, and enhance the                 profit-making ability of many manufacturing companies.",
