The purpose of the research is to develop                              and extend recent innovative analytical techniques                              in the field of optimal and adaptive control of                                 controlled Markov processes.  Of major interest is                              the development of non-parametric adaptive                                      estimation and control methods, and the use of                                  machine learning methods to deal with realistic                                 situations when the model of the system is not                                  completely known in advance.                                                                                                                                    Controlled Markov processes are mathematical                                    descriptions of the evolution and control of                                    processes that involve sequential decision-making                               under uncertainty.  Quality of information,                                     inaccurate models, and computational implementation                             are important issues.  The Mexican PI is widely                                 acknowledged to be an authority on optimal and                                  adaptive control of adaptive control of Markov                                  processes, while the U.S. PI will bring to the                                  collaboration, his expertise in statistical and                                 probabilistic methods and the theory of machine                                 learning.  This wide range of complementary skills                              makes it likely that the work will yield advances in                            the design and analysis of new techniques in this                               field.",
