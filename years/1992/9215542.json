 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Dan Healan, MS Christine Hernandez will              collect data for her doctoral dissertation. For several years with              National Science Foundation support Dr. Healan has conducted                    archaeological excavation in the Zinapecuaro region of Central                  Mexico. What makes this area important are its abundant deposits of             high quality obsidian (volcanic glass). Because this material may               be worked to produce sharp edges it was highly prized raw material              for tools in pre-metal times. Evidence to date indicates that                   Zinapecuaro obsidian was traded over a wide region and that                     patterns of exchange varied over time. Dr. Healan and his                       colleagues have excavated in a number of mining and production                  areas and collected large amounts of material. The problem they now             face is dating each occurrence. Luckily numerous ceramic remains                have been recovered and because ceramic styles change over time                 analysis of them provides a fruitful approach. MS Hernandez will                travel to Mexico and study these ceramic materials. Applying a                  standard type variety approach in conjunction with stratigraphic                information, she will seriate these materials to establish a                    sequence. Through the identification of exotic or foreign potsherds             she will tie the local sequence into a broader inter-regional                   context. Finally she will study how inter-regional relationships                developed and changed over time.                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons. It will provide a               chronological sequence which many archaeologists can use for a                  variety of goals. It will shed light on the economic and political              relationships between societies at a relatively simple level of                 development and elucidate the ways in which they interact. It will              also assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
