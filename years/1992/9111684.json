 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are numerous basic plasma processes which are of                     fundamental importance in solar-terrestrial physics.  Among                     these, the expansion of the solar wind in solar corona is an                    outstanding example which has attracted a great deal of                         theoretical interest during the past many years.  In the last                   several decades, many researchers have made important and                       valuable contributions to the understanding of this process.  In                this research, there are several relevant problems which will be                addressed.                                                                                                                                                           Since the first theoretical model of coronal expansion                     proposed by Parker (1958), there have been many discussions                     (e.g., Whang and Chang, 1965; Hartle and Sturrock, 1968; Nishida,               1969; Hozer and Axford, 1970; Geiss et al., 1970; Lemaire and                   Schere, 1971; Leer and Axford, 1972; Lemaire and Scherer, 1971)                 utilized on a kinetic approach.  All other discussions are based                on hydrodynamic theory, whether one-fluid theory or two-fluid                   theory was used.  Furthermore, most of them have imposed the                    assumption of thermal isotropy which seems to be justifiable by                 observational results but is actually not.  Of course, there are                other publications in the literature in which both kinetic models               and effects of thermal anisotropy have been considered, but these               discussions may not emphasize the coronal region.                                                                                                                    This work builds on the view of Fichtner and Fahr (1990)                   who remarked that their results can be important for the                        discussion of waves, because thermal anisotropy can result in a                 variety of instabilities which should in turn lead to significant               consequences.  It is in this context that the studies should                    complement the existing theories.  This study does not directly                 address the coronal expansion.  Rather, it will pay special                     attention to the effects of plasma turbulence on the dynamic                    process.",
