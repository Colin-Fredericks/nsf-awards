 "awd_abstract_narration": "Attempts to duplicate expert problem solving behavior and                  concomitantly to deal with uncertain and incomplete information                 and knowledge have focused special attention on the mathematics                 of uncertain reasoning.  Techniques for treating the                            uncertainties which arise in expert systems have come from a                    spectrum of mathematical theories ranging from classical                        probability to heuristic rules based on empirical observations of               expert behavior.                                                                     This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research                    Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on Uncertain Reasoning to               be held June 1-5, 1992 at the University of North Dakota at Grand               Forks.  Professor Glenn Shafer of the University of Kansas will                 be the principal lecturer.  To stimulate interest and activity in               mathematical research, the National Science Foundation each year                supports a number of NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conferences in                  the Mathematical Sciences.  Each five-day conference features a                 distinguished lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic of                  important current research in one sharply focused area of the                   mathematical sciences.  The lecturer subsequently prepares an                   expository monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally               published by the American Mathematical Society or the Society for               Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the American                  Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical                       Statistics.  Certain features differentiate these conferences                   from typical research conferences.  These are: (1) Focus on a                   single important and timely area of research by a leading                       practitioner, (2) Continued effect and local stimulation through                regional emphasis, (3) Panel review for quality, breadth, and                   timeliness, and (4) Published monographs for a wider audience.",
