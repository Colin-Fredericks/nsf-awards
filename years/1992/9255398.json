 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed Research Planning Grant is to                          structure a substantial three-year program of research on                       young children's learning of chance and probability.  I                         propose to focus on chance and probability because of the                       richness of the ideas themselves, the connections that                          chance and probability make possible between mathematics and                    science, and the powerful vision of mathematics that such a                     focus could convey to young children.  The research program                     investigates primary grade children's explorations of chance                    and probability from the perspective of collaborative                           problem solving instruction.  It also examines the effects                      of learning these concepts in different situations, because                     of the growing recognition of the influence of context on                       knowledge-construction.  Activities of the Research Planning                    Grant include completion of literature reviews, refinement                      and extension of instructional interventions, implementation                    of two pilot research cycles, drafting of a theoretical                         framework to capture the multiple aspects of children's                         conceptual development in this domain and their effect on                       problem solving, and the preparation of the full grant                          proposal.  The first pilot research cycle focuses on pairs                      of second graders engaged in a series of chance and                             probability tasks, involving prediction, empirical                              investigation, extrapolations and explanation.  The second                      pilot cycle extends the research to small group learning and                    also begins to explore the entailments of different                             situations for children's understanding of chance and                           probability.  All sessions are videotaped to enable                             microanalysis of children's thinking and the effectiveness                      of the activity sequence.  The research aims to construct                       and refine powerful models of problem solving instruction in                    the domain of chance and probability, as it uses these as a                     vehicle to closely examine young children's knowledge-                          construction.",
