 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, to be conducted in the Department of Chemistry                   at the University of California, San Diego, will utilize                        time-resolved laser spectroscopy to probe for evidence of                       solvent cage effects on Lewis acid base reactions.  The                         acid-base pair will be generated by photolytic dissociation of                  a ligand from a six-coordinate, iron-porphyrin complex.                         Changes in temperature and/or pressure will be used to extend                   the temporal range of the spectroscopic experiments, which will                 be helpful in determining what portion of the reaction occurs                   in the solvent cage and what occurs after diffusion of the                      reagents out of the solvent cage.                                               %%%                                                                             Professor Douglas Magde of the Department of Chemistry at the                   University of California, San Diego will conduct experiments on                 pairs of reactant molecules generated in close proximity in                     solution.  Subsequent reactions of these molecules will be                      monitored using rapid spectroscopic methods to determine                        whether the surrounding solvent molecules provide a cage effect                 that serves to hold the reactants together, or whether the                      molecules are totally free to move apart and react later in a                   subsequent encounter.  These studies are designed to provide                    fundamental information important for all reactions that occur                  in solution.  The reactants chosen for study are related to                     biological oxygen carriers so that the results will have                        special applicability to biological functions.",
