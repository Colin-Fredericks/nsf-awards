 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study the stratigraphy, biostratigraphy,               and geochronology of the San Timoteo Badlands.  It contains a                   sequence of nonmarine deposits about 12,000 feet thick that ranges              in age from about 5 to 0.7 Ma, yields remains of fossil mammals                 throughout the sequence, and contains lithologies amenable to                   magnetostratigraphic and isotopic age analysis.  The deposits, the              Mt. Eden and San Timoteo formations, occur in well exposed outcrops             of an anticline that plunges gently northwestward and is truncated              on its southwestern edge by the currently active San Jacinto fault.             The San Jacinto, the most active strand of the San Andreas fault                system in southern California, underwent about 24 km of right slip              during the past two million years.  Paleocurrent data indicate that             the sediments were transported to the San Timoteo basin from the                north and northeast.  Distinctive clast suites in the rocks are                 consistent with derivation from sources in those directions now                 northeast of the Badlands; some east of the present San Andreas                 fault (s.s).  The San Timoteo beds thus are ideally situated in                 space and time to promote investigations of the slip history of                 elements of the San Andreas fault system during the past 5 million              years.  These beds are the only sequence that accumulated                       relatively continuously during this span of time in this part of                southern California.                                                                 A detailed analysis of age of these beds has never been                    attempted.  The program of age analysis will include vertebrate                 paleontology and biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy and isotope               chronology.  If successful, the results will dramatically improve               our ability to attempt a reconstruction of the sedimentary history              of the San Timoteo beds, and palinspastic reconstructions of the                tectonic block that contains them relative to the then adjacent                 terranes in this region.  The data also will be valuable in                     addressing the timing of transfer of regional slip from the San                 Andreas fault strands (s.s) to the San Jacinto fault, will improve              our ability to evaluate when and how the entire San Andreas system              became effectively \"locked\" in this region; will sharpen the focus              of local investigations of slip rates on the San Andreas, and on                how regional shear between the Pacific and American plates is                   propagated through the Transverse Ranges province.",
