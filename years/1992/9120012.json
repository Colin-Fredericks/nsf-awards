 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Atmospheric Sciences Department at Creighton University will                expand it PC network and add a UNIX base workstation to the                     network.  The present PC configuration which runs McIDAS software               has proven to be a useful tool for interactive display of                       meteorological data, but this system is inadequate to meet the                  teaching and research goals of the department.  This award will                 augment Creighton's present network which consists of IBM Models 80             and 70.  Funds to purchase three new 486-based PC will be awarded.              In addition, a UNIX-based workstation will be awarded.  The                     workstation will greatly enhance the capability with the addition               of a workstation to run several meteorological software packages                which are not available on PC hardware.  This new equipment will                become a vital tool in many of Creighton's classes which expose                 students to computer-based meteorological displays.  The additional             equipment also will expand opportunities for undergraduate and                  graduate research.",
