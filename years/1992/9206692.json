 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed toward the elucidation of intracellular                signalling pathways that involve calcium in the transduction of                 hormonal and environmental stimuli in higher plants.  The project               is focused on the necessity and sufficiency of changes in cytosolic             calcium activity in aleurone cells from wheat seeds after                       hormonally- or environmentally-induced germination.  The early                  signal transduction events in the seed culminate in a change in                 gene expression in the aleurone cells.  Cytosolic calcium activity              changes will be determined in individual cells fluorometrically,                and changes in calcium channel activity that underlie the                       redistribution of calcium will be assessed by patch clamp studies.              Finally, the timing of the changes in gene expression will be                   compared with the timing of shifts in cytosolic calcium activity.               The thrust of the project is to link transient shifts in cytosolic              calcium activity with specific changes in channel activity and with             changes in transcription and translation.                                       %%%                                                                                This study is directed toward intracellular signalling pathways              in higher plants.  In the process of seed germination, much is                  known about hormonal activation of the aleurone cells in the seed               and much is known about the changes in gene expression that follow              several hours after hormonal stimulation, but the intermediary                  steps of hormonal reception and intracellular signal transduction               that lead to altered transcription and translation remain elusive.              This project will provide significant, new information on the                   involvement of calcium in the cascade that culminates in altered                gene expression in developing seeds of wheat.",
