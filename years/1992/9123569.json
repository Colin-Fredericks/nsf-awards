 "awd_abstract_narration": "The clearance of tropical forests has been cited as one of the major         factors contributing to the loss of biological diversity and to changes         in atmospheric chemistry that may ultimately lead to global warming.            While human activities have been identified as major causes of tropical         deforestation, relatively little attention has been focused on the              processes by which individuals and groups of people (whether functioning        together informally or in more formal organizational units) actually            make decisions that result in forest clearance.  This project will              develop and test a theory that identifies two forms of human action as          means through which people act to remove tropical forests.  One form of         action is through the development of \"growth coalitions\" that act in a          relatively coordinated manner to establish and operate an infrastructure        aimed at removing trees and establishing more \"developed\" forms of              activity.  The other form of action is a somewhat ad hoc process that           occurs when individuals with limited personal resources follow road-            construction crews into new areas and clear small parcels near the              roads.  This tests of this theory will be undertaken through analyses of        two extant databases that provide information about deforestation in a          number of different countries.  One database was gathered by the Food           and Agriculture Organization in 1980 and 1990 in order to provide               numerical estimates of amounts of deforestation.  The second database           consists of country-specific descriptions of deforestation based on             reports prepared by FAO and the International Union on the Conservation         of Nature and on other scientific studies.  Theoretically relevant              variables from these databases will be assembled into truth tables and          the tables will be simplified through the use of Boolean algebra.               Subsequent analyses should provide more direct insights into the causal         links among different variables, thereby improving our understandings of        the processes by which growth coalitions and individual actors clear            forests.                                                                           This project will make contributions to our understandings of                tropical deforestation through a number of different means.  It will            develop and test new theoretical models about the processes of                  deforestation.  Assembly and analysis of empirical data will provide            valuable tests of these new models, and the data will become available          for use by investigators for other related studies.  The project also           will enable some relatively new analytic procedures to be assessed in           order to determine their efficacy and limitations for use in evaluating         both quantitative and qualitative information.",
