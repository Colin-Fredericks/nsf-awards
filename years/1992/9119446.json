 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many new data management systems are being developed to support                 applications with advanced data management requirements, such as                extended relational models, persistent programming languages and                object-oriented databases. Such systems enhance semantic                        expressiveness, but they must offer good performance to be viable               commercial technologies. An area particularly needful of improved               performance is query processing, where new modeling features such               as encapsulation, type hierarchies, complex values and object                   identity make conventional set-processing methods difficult or                  ineffective to apply. The overall goal of the Revelation project                is to expand query processing to address and exploit these new                  modeling extensions at all levels of query processing, from                     schema management, through optimization and physical planning, to               runtime support. For encapsulation, a Revealer is incorporated, a               trusted system component that can access type implementations.                  Heterogeneity in collections arising from subtyping and                         polymorphism is handled by an Annotater that reasons across                     schema definitions. Complex values and identity are addressed                   both at the logical algebra level, with new operations to deal                  with ordered structures such as sequences and arrays, and at the                physical level with new operators such as one to assemble complex               objects. This project will construct a prototype query processor,               exploiting existing software technology such as the Volcano                     optimizer generator and the Volcano query evaluation system.",
