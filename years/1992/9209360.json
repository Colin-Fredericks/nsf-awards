 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation Support award is undergirded by William              Julius Wilson's concentration of poverty thesis.  The primary                   purpose of the analysis is to examine the political consequences                of living in extreme poverty communities.  The model for the                    investigation incorporates explanatory factors from both the urban              underclass and political participation literatures.  The exogenous              variables are neighborhood context and family context, while the                endogenous variables are socio-economic status, political                       orientation and political behavior.                                                                                                                             The data used to test the model will come from a survey of 400                  Black residents in extreme povery and low poverty neighborhoods in              Columbus, Ohio.  The data will be collected through telephone                   interviewing by Polimetrics Laboratory at the Ohio State                        University.                                                                                                                                                     The significance of the research rests on its attempts to assess                the extent to which underclass or extreme poverty neighborhoods and             impaired family contexts, have debilitating influences on the                   political orientations and behavior of residents.  Studies of the               political consequences of living in concentrated poverty                        communities are crucial to the understanding of the effects of                  poverty on political democracy.",
