 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of computer aided process design has advanced                          substantially in the recent past.  Among some of these recent                   developments are new methods to design complex industrial                       systems.  There is an economic incentive to develop such                        engineering tools provided they are simple and accurate and                     are able to discriminate between process alternatives very                      early in the life of a project in order to eliminate designs                    that are unsafe, uncontrollable, as well as uneconomic.  An                     area of both commercial and academic interest which has not                     been successfully addressed to date is the design of nonideal,                  multicomponent distillation systems.  When the process streams                  form an ideal mixture, existing conceptual design methods                       provide efficient means for narrowing down the possible                         distillation sequences to a small number of promising                           alternatives.  These can then be designed and costed in more                    detail using simulator-based techniques.  For nonideal and                      azeotropic mixtures, however, there exist no procedures or                      tools for choosing between different nonideal distillation                      sequences without carrying out extensive full-scale computer                    aided simulations and costing.                                                                                                                                  The PI plans to develop a new class of techniques for computer                  aided analysis, design and synthesis of nonideal and                            azeotropic distillation systems.  The methods exploit                           geometric properties of the nonlinear discrete dynamical                        system representation of the steady state composition                           profiles in the composition state space.  The procedure can be                  extended to include multicomponent reactive distillation                        columns.  The technique also provides a procedure for                           determining the minimum flows and the number of theoretical                     stages in each column section for reflux ratios above the                       minimum without the necessity of lengthy iterative schemes, as                  is the current practice.  The PI plans to look at commercially                  important situations including non-sharp splits, multiple-feed                  columns, and tangent pinches.",
