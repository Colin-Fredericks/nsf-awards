 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past year, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) has been                successful in fabricating holographic rugate structures for the UV,             visible, and very near IR regions of the spectrum.  These                       holographic mirrors demonstrated laser damage thresholds which were             5 times better than the best dielectric multilayer coatings, with               reflectivities in excess of 99.9%.  This research project proposes              to extend this holographic rugate technology to the region from 1               um to 3um.  The holographic recording process for the IR region                 should also yield ultra high damage thresholds and be easily                    scalable to very large optics.  The holographic processes employed              use low temperature deposition methods and an integration of                    holographic coatings with gratings.  These gratings can be used as              beam samplers to output couplers.  The potential for a simple                   fabrication process, low absorption characteristics of the                      recording medium, and a demonstrated radiation harness make POC'S               coating process an ideal new technology for civilian and military               applications.  POC's approach will greatly reduce structural                    weight, thermal load and cost compared to existing coating                      technologies since it can be applied to light-weigh substrates such             as graphic-epoxy, mylar, aluminum, and ultra-thin glass.  Moreover,             initial experimental results have demonstrated that the coating has             no degrassing problem.",
