 "awd_abstract_narration": "BioCom, patterned after ChemCom, will focus on the study of                     a few, selected biological concepts in an environmental,                        technological and community context.  Students will                             investigate an issue, discover appropriate biological                           principles and apply their knowledge actively, in context,                      allowing them to construct personal meaning in a setting                        where their explanation will be revealed.  Students will                        investigate, study and analyze what is necessary to resolve                     issues in topics including Waste, Energy, Population Limits,                    Organismal Maintenance, Population Maintenance, Behavior,                       and Evolution.  Project 2061 themes for biology and the                         human organism will be covered.  The materials, the                             activities, and the ancillaries will be developed by a team                     of scientists, biology educators and high school teachers,                      guided by a national advisory board.  The units will be                         carefully pilot tested and field tested in diverse                              locations.  The major products of the project will be a                         student textbook, shorter than usual, a teacher edition, a                      looseleaf teacher resource book with additional                                 investigations, project masters, test items, and a high-tech                    kit.  The materials will be published by Kendall/Hunt, who                      will also support teacher enhancement.",
