 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regulation of maternal RNAs is critical to early development.               Dr. Kimble proposes to take a combined genetic and molecular                    approach to analyze maternal RNA controls in the nematode C.                    elegans. The fem-3 and glp-1 genes express maternal RNAs that                   regulate sex determination and inductive cell interactions in                   early embryos. Preliminary evidence suggests that the 3'                        untranslated regions of these RNAs regulate their activity at the               level of translation. Dr. Kimble proposes to address the                        mechanisms by which the fem-3 and glp-1 maternal RNAs are                       controlled in three ways. First, she will ask whether the fem-3                 and glp-1 maternal RNAs are translationally controlled. To this                 end, she will examine the distribution of their endogenous RNAs                 and proteins and assess their association with polysomes. Second,               she will identify sequence elements necessary for regulation. To                this  end, she will inject reporter RNAs carrying wild-type and                 mutant sequences from fem-3 or glp-1 into the germ line and assay               their translational capacity in oocytes and early embryos. Third,               she will begin to analyze factors that regulate maternal RNAs. To               this end, she will rely on gel shift assays and analysis of mog-1               mutants. An understanding of how maternal RNAs are regulated in                 C. elegans will provide insight into this fundamental control of                early development and also will allow expression of specific                    proteins to be manipulated in early embryos.",
