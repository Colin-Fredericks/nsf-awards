 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of the U.S. JGOFS program is to quantify the role of               the equatorial Pacific in global biogeochemical fluxes.  Quasi-                 stationary upwelling of nitrate-rich water within this extensive                oceanic regime stimulates primary productivity and can lead to                  localized phytoplankton biomass accumulations.  The atmospheric                 and physical forcings which regulate phytoplankton production are               complex and variable and lead to large spatio-temporal variations               in carbon fixation rates and phytoplankton standing stocks.                     Accurate resolution of phytoplankton processes will require                     sampling on appropriate time and space scales as well as an                     understanding of hydrodynamical forces.  Toward this objective                  the P.I. propose to (1) provide core measurements of algal                      pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids, phycobilins and                            phaeopigments) during the two survey cruises (fall and spring)                  and the 1992 spring time-series cruise; and (2) conduct photo-                  ecological investigations of phytoplankton.  Analytical analyses                will employ QA/QC procedures to insure highly accurate and                      precise, as well as 'comparable' data.  Photo-ecological studies                will incorporate core pigment data to (A) infer seasonal, spatial               and depth-dependent variations in phytoplankton biomass and                     composition; (B) estimate rates of vertical mixing of                           phytoplankton; and (C) bio-optically model depth-dependent rates                of primary production from shipboard and moored platforms.",
