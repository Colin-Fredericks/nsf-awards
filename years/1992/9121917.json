 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surface diffusion on semiconductors is examined by direct                       imaging of adsorbate concentration profiles using surface                       second harmonic generation (SHG).  Work in the antimony on                      germanium (111) system has demonstrated that the SHG method                     avoids many of the problems associated with other methods,                      permits extraction of the coverage dependence of the                            diffusivity without paramaterization, and allows observation                    of the effects of ambient gas pressure on surface diffusion.                    The present effort focusses on III-V adsorbates (including                      gallium arsenide) on silicon and germanium.  Activation                         energies and preexponential factors for diffusion are measured                  as functions of surface concentration and of the density and                    orientation of surface steps.  The approach is also being                       extended to gaseous adsorbates such as triethylgallium.  The                    effects of various factors on diffusion are examined; these                     include photon flux, electric fields directed parallel to the                   surface, and ambient noble gases.                                                                                                                               Surface diffusion often has a primary role in governing the                     rates of surface reactions, particularly for those involved in                  the formation of thin films of semiconductors by chemical                       vapor deposition or molecular beam epitaxy.  Control of the                     process and of the quality of the product are hampered by a                     lack of data on surface diffusion.  This research produces an                   efficient and general methodology for obtaining such                            information.",
