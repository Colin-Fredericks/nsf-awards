 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigation of a new approach to the synthesis of highly                  substituted dihydrobenzofurans, dihydroindoles,                                 bicyclo{3.2.1}octenones and cyclobutanes will be made utilizing                 novel regio- and stereoselective Lewis acid catalyzed formal                    cycloaddition reactions of alkenes and alkynes with                             1,4-benzoquinones, 1,4-benzoquinonediimides and alkoxy-alpha,                   beta-unsaturated enones.  The exploration and development of                    enantiospecific variants of these new methods utilizing chiral                  Ti(IV) catalysts is planned and many provide the products in                    high enantiomeric purity.  The structures of the products form                  all, or part of, the basic framework of many classes of                         biologically active molecules and chiral cyclobutanes may also                  be useful in the preparation of novel rod shaped polymers with                  interesting properties  Specific targets include kadsurenone, a                 specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist,                        recaglamide, an antileukemic agent, viniferin, an antifungal                    agent, guianin, a representative neolignan, and acanthodoral, a                 structurally interesting natural product.  In addition,                         syntheses of several 2-and 3-aryl-2,3-dihydrobenzofurans and                    their nitrogen analogs, i.e. 2-and 3-aryl-2,3-dihydroindoles,                   are planned.                                                                    %%%                                                                             With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                 research of Dr. Thomas A. Engler at the University of Kansas.                   The studies will explore new routes to asymmetric molecules                     based on new methods utililzing chiral Ti(IV) based reagents.                   The new synthetic methodology should benefit research in                        biochemistry and medicine, as well as in the chemical industry.",
