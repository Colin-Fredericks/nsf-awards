 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is develop a methodology for                        empirically analyzing differentiated product industries, and                    apply it to study the changes that have occurred in the U.S.                    automobile industry over the last two decades.  The general                     methodology has wide applicability, but the specifics of the                    model are tailored to auto industry application.  Therefore, the                project will have both a methodological and empirical output.                   The empirical goals are twofold: to come to a broad understanding               of the changes that have occurred in the U.S. auto market during                the last twenty years, and to provide an evaluation of public                   policies that have been suggested for this industry.  Of                        particular interest is the impact of enviromnental regulation in                the form of a carbon tax on the auto industry.                                                                                                                  This project involves developing an estimable static model of                   differentiated product markets.  The key elements of the model                  are consumer preferences for the characteristics of marketed                    products, the cost functions of firms, and a market equilibrium                 assumption.  The  research focuses on three methodological                      concerns: to develop a tractable model of consumer behavior that                allows for reasonable substitution patterns, to incorporate the                 presence of product characteristics which are unobserved by the                 researcher, and to account for the process by which firms choose                the characteristics of new products.  The resulting model will be               used to analyze a series of important public concerns in the                    automobile industry including  policies that aim to increase fuel               efficiency, to regulate international trade, and to implement                   anti-trust laws.  Because the model starts at the detailed micro                level, it can provide results not only on the implications of                   these policies for prices and quantities, but also for the                      distribution of consumer welfare among income groups and the                    distribution of profits among producers.",
