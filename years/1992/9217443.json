 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic syntheses are often carried out in organic solvents,                    some of which are toxic, hazardous, or environmentally                          troublesome.  The choice of a solvent for a homogeneous                         synthesis reaction is often limited by the multiple functions                   required of the solvent.  Two of the more important functions                   are: (1) solubilization of the reactants, reaction                              intermediates, and catalyst, and (2) rate or selectivity                        enhancement through the participation of the solvent as a base                  or as a catalyst ligand.  In the aerobic coupling of 2,6-                       dimethylphenol, which is the basis of the commercial                            production of poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO),                     pyridine and nitrobenzene are often used as the reaction media                  because of their high solubilities for dimethylphenol, PPO,                     and cuprous chloride (the coupling catalyst).  But solvents                     such as pyridine and nitrobenzene are highly toxic and                          noxious.  Their use presents health, safety and environmental                   concerns and alternate solvents and technology need to be                       explored.                                                                                                                                                       The objective of this research is to develop oil-water                          interfacial synthesis as a benign alternative to conventional                   syntheses that require the use of toxic solvents.  This                         technique involves a combination of innocuous oil and aqueous                   phases in place of the toxic organic solvent.  The multiple                     functions which previously limited the choice of solvent are                    here decoupled and are met separately by a biphasic mixture.                    The desired reaction is effected at the oil-water interface by                  means of a surface-active complex and by pH control of the                      aqueous phase.  This project will further develop the                           interfacial technique so that it may be (1) optimized and                       adopted for commercial PPO synthesis and (2) extended to other                  synthesis reactions that have commercial potential.  The                        research will receive intellectual input and possible long-                     term financial support from Mallinckrodt Specialty Chemicals                    Company.",
