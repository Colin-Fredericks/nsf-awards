 "awd_abstract_narration": "From its origins nearly two centuries ago, Hamiltonian                     dynamics has grown to embrace the physics of nearly all systems                 that evolve without dissipation, as well as a number of branches                of mathematics.  The power and elegance of Hamiltonian methods                  were first seized upon in the mid-nineteenth century by                         theoretical astronomers, who reduced problems in their discipline               to the task of finding enough \"integrals\" of an appropriate                     Hamiltonian system; these integrals were difficult to find except               for the simplest systems.  Poincare showed that the emphasis                    should not be placed on solving the equations for a physical                    system, but rather that the important features of a system's                    behavior could be found by other means.  These new methods had a                strong effect on mathematics itself, as the fields of topology                  and dynamical systems arose out of Poincare's qualitative,                      geometric vision of problems in celestial mechanics and                         Hamiltonian systems.  The qualitative approach to dynamical                     systems has remained an active research area, especially now that               computers provide a \"laboratory\" in which to view systems of                    increasing complexity.  Driven partly by the discovery in these                 experiments of new phenomena and partly by the maturation of the                mathematical disciplines arising out of Poincare's work, the                    results and methods of Hamiltonian systems have grown and                       penetrated neighboring fields of research.                                           This project will support an International Conference on                   Hamiltonian Dynamical Systems to be held from March 25-28, 1992                 at the University of Cincinnati.  The conference will gather                    together leading and newer researchers to discuss the latest                    results in Hamiltonian systems and its applications, and to gain                an overview of how those results relate to each other and to the                discipline as a whole.  To emphasize the comprehensive aspect of                the conference, at least one of the plenary speakers will be a                  professional historian of science, and will discuss the subject                 in the broadest possible terms.",
