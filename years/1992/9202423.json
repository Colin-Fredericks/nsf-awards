 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode.                The objective of this project is the design of behavioral control               techniques for a simulated network of army ant robotic devices.                 The devices envisioned are small, inexpensive, and identical                    mobile platforms which cannot transport material individually,                  but can cooperate to lift and carry arbitrarily large objects.                  The behavioral control approach seeks to minimize the complexity                of the units and the communications necessary by designing their                collective function into their group behavior rather than through               individual performance.  Each \"ant\" will be programmed to respond               to sensory stimulus with simple reactions.  The collective effect               of many such reactions will be the desired maneuvering task, in                 much the dame way teams of humans can transport heavy objects                   with minimal communications.  Sensory inputs necessary will                     include applied forces and the attitude of the load being                       carried.  The set of behavioral reactions designed will be                      implemented in a computer simulation.  The simulation will also                 model the dynamics of the load, the force and attitude sensors,                 \"beacon\" signals emitted by the units, and the possibility of                   uneven or rough terrain.  The speed, stability and accuracy of                  the material transport system will be evaluated in order to                     further develop the controls and to suggest behavioral approaches               to broader army-ant problems, such as team-forming,                             reorganization, navigation, and message-passing.  The result of                 the work will be a paradigm for material transport using modular                networks of small machines as opposed to using large robots to                  transport small objects.//",
