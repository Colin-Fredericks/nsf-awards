 "awd_abstract_narration": "In all plants, one of the isoprotein variants of histone H3, a               packaging protein for genes in chromatin, appears conserved.  It                is not, as most histones, synthesized only when cell DNA is                     doubled.  Such a continuously synthesized histone H3 form is known              in mammals and birds as a Replacement Variant because it replaces               DNA packaging whenever chromatin packaging units, nucleosomes, have             been lost.  This can occur when polymerases transcribe or replicate             genes.  Nucleosome re-assembly uses available histones and these                are the Replacement histones in cells not involved in DNA                       replication.  These histones can be different in structure and this             allows one to follow them by gel electrophoresis and high                       performance liquid chromatography.  This project studies, in                    alfalfa and Arabidopsis, the expression in the cell cycle of the                first core histone variant in plants to test the predictions of a               function as Replacement Variant.  RNA is measured by variant                    specific RT-PCR and protein by histone labeling and purification.               Is its high level of acetylation, a modification of histones in                 transcriptionally active chromatin, the result of preferential                  assembly on active genes?  Does histone turnover vary with                      chromatin conformation?  Possible modulation of expression by                   development and environment (osmolarity, heat, phytohormones) will              be evaluated.                                                                                                                                                   Histones are a major class of DNA-associated proteins which are                 involved in the \"packaging\" of DNA into chromatin, particularly                 into the nucleosome structure which represents the \"bead\" of the                \"bead on a string\" description of chromatin organization.  This                 project will elucidate the role of a putative Replacement Variant               histone which is synthesized throughout the cell cycle and serves               to package pre-existing DNA, unlike other histone variants which                are synthesized during the period of DNA synthesis and serve to                 package the newly synthesized DNA prior to mitosis.",
