 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many key questions in behavioral ecology can be profitably                      addressed by applying endocrinological techniques.  This research               will examine the physiological basis of plasticity of reproductive              behavior in a biparental burying beetle (Nicrophorus orbicollis).               Correlative analyses will be used in two ways to implicate                      specific hormones in the regulation of reproductive behavior.                   First, titer curves for juvenile hormone and ecdysteroids will be               developed for both males and females across a complete                          reproductive cycle. Second, environmental variables will be                     manipulated to alter the quality and duration of paternal care;                 these behavioral responses will be matched to concurrent hormonal               responses.  To examine the casual relationship between hormones                 and behavior, hormone treatments will be made in an attempt to                  induce changes in behavioral patterns.  The endocrine techniques                that are developed will subsequently be utilized as sensitive                   probes to identify the particular environmental stimuli that                    influence decision-making in burying beetles.  Hormonal                         manipulations will also be employed to alter male parental                      behavior in order to examine effects on reproductive success,                   female parental behavior, costs of maternal care and host                       selection by a symbiotic phoretic mite.  For the first time, this               study will integrate hormonal and behavioral analyses of an                     invertebrate species that exhibits biparental care, infanticide                 and mate desertion and thus will bring new depth to the study of                plasticity of reproductive behavior.",
