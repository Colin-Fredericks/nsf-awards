 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the fact that about seventy percent of all flowering plants             are hermaphroditic, the reproductive consequences of combining both             sexes on a single plant are still poorly understood.  Traditional               studies of reproductive success in such plants have focused on                  fecundity, ignoring the affects of pollen flow.  Recent                         investigations have switched attention to patterns of paternal gene             flow in search for \"sexual selection\" in plants.  Few studies to                date have attempted to quantify the affects of floral                           characteristics on both male and female reproductive fitness.  I                propose to investigate the affects of inflorescence size on the                 reproductive success of Yucca whipplei, a semelparous hermaphrodite             native to southern California.  Inflorescence size typically                    differs greatly between males and females in dioecious plant                    species, indicating that selective pressures on inflorescence size              are not the same for the two functions.  Several alternate                      hypotheses which could explain apparent overproduction of flowers               by Yucca whipplei will be tested.  These hypothesis include aspects             of both male and female reproductive success.  This research will               help determine some of the fitness consequences of hermaphroditic               reproduction, and how plants can respond to the sometimes                       conflicting selective pressures resulting from combining both sexes             on a single individual.",
