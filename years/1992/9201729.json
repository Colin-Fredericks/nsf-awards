 "awd_abstract_narration": "Putinar will investigate two sets of problems.  The first                  concerns Toeplitz operators on multivariable Bergman spaces and                 their relevance for the function theory of several complex                      variables.  He will relate the spectral problems for this class                 of operators to the theory of functions in pseudoconvex domains                 with L2-growth control at the boundary.  The second set of                      problems is related to the theory of moments in Euclidean n-                    space.  Putinar will try to determine methods for solving certain               moment problems on semialgebraic subsets by using specific                      operator theories.                                                                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the               infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,               when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has                the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                   matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                  operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                    associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                      underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,               and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.",
