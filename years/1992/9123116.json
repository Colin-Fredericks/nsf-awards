 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation study uses interest group theory,                    especially the relationships between the state and functional                   groups in society, to explain how natural resource policies                     are made in the developing world.  Specifically, the research                   posits that the state, being at the pinnacle of a system of                     limited and structured, albeit meaningful, public                               invlovement, seeks that type of bargaining with interest                        groups within society which furthers its own power and                          endurance.  This conceptualization puts developing world                        conservation programs into a broader political context, and                     links an understanding of environmental policies to an                          understanding of the broader political power relationships                      within the polity.                                                                                                                                              The project test these and related propositions about African                   environmental policymaking, using Zimbabwe's elephant                           conservation regime as a case study.  Using survey research,                    interviews, and contextual data, this research empirically                      probes the nature of wildlife conservation policymaking in                      Zimbabwe, with a firm theoretical eye toward generalization                     about conservation policy regimes in the developing world,                      especially the role of group-state bargaining in                                policymaking.  The research will be conducted under the                         auspices of the University of Zimbabwe's Centre for Applied                     Social Sciences (CASS), which has been executing research on                    the human dimensions of wildlife conservation for over three                    years.",
