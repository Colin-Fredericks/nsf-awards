 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to produce six additional Jasper                    adventures plus video extensions for each adventure, and                        relevant print and professional development teacher                             materials.  Included with each Jasper adventure will be an                      optional piece of software, called the Adventure Maker, that                    will allow students to create their own adventures.  In                         addition, the adventures and materials will be field tested                     in sites across the country.  This series, as with the                          previous series, will be designed to be implemented at                          various levels of hardware.  It is designed to be used in                       conjunction with videodisc technology.  The simplest level                      of technology is with a videodisc player and a hand-held                        remote; the second level is to use a videodisc player with                      barcode; the third level involves computer based control of                     the videodisc with hypercard stacks and computational and                       graphic tools.  The project has an extensive research                           component which includes an analysis of the reactions to                        Jasper characters and adventures, an assessment of teachers'                    ideas for implementation, expanded assessments of student                       learning, studies of the value-added of Jasper software, and                    research on the Adventure Maker.",
