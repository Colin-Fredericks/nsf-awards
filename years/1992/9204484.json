 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shelstad will continue her work on twisted endoscopy for                   reductive groups.  This is a part of the theory of automorphic                  forms which she has been instrumental in developing, and is based               on the general representation theory of reductive Lie groups.                   It is also planned to develop Igusa theory for orbital integrals                on real groups.  The goal is to obtain results useful for                       multiplicity formulas for automorphic representations.                               The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                   twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                 exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                             representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                   upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                    theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                        mechanics and elementary particle physics.",
