 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the development of an interdisciplinary                  undergraduate curriculum in multimedia, user interfaces, and                    computer-human interaction.  Six new undergraduate courses                      will be developed covering user interface development, human                    information processing, computer graphics, computer-supported                   cooperative work, scientific visualization and human factors                    in Interface design.  This curriculum development is a                          collaborative effort between the Department of Computer                         Science and the Department of Psychology.  An R&D laboratory                    will be established to develop software and course materials                    needed to support the new curriculum.  Each course development                  will include a CD-ROM with a printed monograph.  All                            educational materials will be made available to other academic                  institutions and results of the project will be presented at                    professional workshops and conferences.                                                                                                                         SUNY, Stonybrook proposes to develop an interdisciplinary                       undergraduate curriculum in multimedia, user interfaces, and                    computer-human interaction.  This will be a collaborative                       effort between the Department of Computer Science and the                       Department of Psychology.  Course materials, software, a set                    of monographs and CD-ROM's , which will be produced as part of                  the project, will be widely disseminated in the academic                        community.  The results of the curriculum and materials                         development will be disseminated through publications, and                      presentations at professional meetings.",
