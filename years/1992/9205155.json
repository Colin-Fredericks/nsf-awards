 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France (INRIA) cooperative                  research in parallel computational methods in Markov Chains.                    William Stewart of North Carolina State University and Bernard                  Phillipe of INRIA in Rennes, France are the U.S. and French                     coordinators.  The project involves additional U.S. and French                  researchers in parallel computing, computer performance                         evaluation, parallel algorithms and numerical methods.  The                     investigators propose to examine new methods for finding                        equilibrium solutions of large, sparse Markov Chains using parallel             computers.  They propose  new techniques for computing special                  cases of stochastic matrices and small matrices  and to examine a               variety of computer architectures using vector processors, shared               memory multiprocessors, distributed memory multiprocessors and                  massively parallel architectures.  The project will benefit from                complementary expertise and sharing of essential equipment.  The                U.S. and French investigators bring to this collaboration expertise             in computer science and applied mathematics.  The essential                     equipment for doing parallel processing architectures are available             at participating U.S. institutions and at INRIA, the French national            research institute for information science and automation.  INRIA               is a world class institute in computer and information science and              leads a European consortium of research organizations in these                  fields.                                                                                                                                                         Markov Chains are useful mathematical devices for describing real               systems and queuing networks.  The proposed research will be very               important in telecommunications, computer performance and                       manufacturing systems modeling.  Advances in this area will have                far-reaching effects since Markov Chains are models used in other               areas of science and engineering.",
