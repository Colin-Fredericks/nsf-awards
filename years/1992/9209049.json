 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to understand the dynamic                response of continuous media via the study of singularities for                 the governing partial differential equations of motion.  Three                  topics are proposed: (i) Formation of shear bands at high strain                rates; (ii) Study of self-similar viscous limits and of radial                  solutions for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws; (iii)                    Hydrodynamic limits for discrete velocity models in the case of                 Riemann data.                                                                        Shear bands are regions of intensely localized strain that                 appear during high speed deformations of metals and often precede               rupture.  For that reason their study is critical for the design                of improved materials in situations of high speed plastic flow.                 The theoretical understanding of structures such as shock waves                 or shear bands is critical for designing improved algorithms in                 technological applications where such phenomena are dominant, for               instance in ballistic penetration of metals and in various                      manufacturing processes involving metals.",
