At the heart of the institute is a program of individual student                research projects carried out in the laboratories and under the                 direction of physics and engineering researchers at CWRU, NASA                  Lewis Research Center, and one other local research facility.  A                week-long physics content component strongly emphasizing guided                 inquiry laboratory work and sessions on research methodology will               precede the commencement of the research projects; the content                  sessions attend to both physics fundamentals and topics in current              research.  Career exploration activities include field trips to                 government and private research labs, a hospital medical physics                department, and a nuclear power plant; guest presentations by                   academic and industrial science professionals will offer further                opportunities for students to hear career perspectives from                     practicing scientists and engineers in both research and education.",
