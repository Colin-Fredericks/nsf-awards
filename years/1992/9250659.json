 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in computing technology continue both to bring marked                  changes in the skills needed for physics research and to                        present new opportunities for physics teaching.  A two-fold                     problem faces many physics departments today:  (1) how to give                  their undergraduate majors the computing tools and skills they                  will later need, such as proficiency in programming, using                      spreadsheets and computational packages like Mathematica,                       technical word processing, data acquisition and analysis, and                   networking;  and (2) how to make room to learn these new tools                  and skills by rethinking the educational use of computing and                   the content of the courses required for majors.  This project                   sets out a program to attack this problem to find a solution                    that can serve as a national model for other physics                            departments.                                                                                                                                                    With three NeXT workstations and release time provided by this                  grant, the entire faculty of the department will spend portions                 of a 15-month period working on a comprehensive and coherent                    integration of workstations and computing in the core physics                   curriculum, one that will not add to the number of courses                      required for the major nor increase student workload.  Each of                  the faculty will focus on one or two courses they have recently                 taught and for which they will be responsible the following                     year.  They will explore computer-based pedagogical                             opportunities for themselves, and devise ways to build on and                   extend the computing skills learned by students in prior                        courses.  Faculty will also be assisted by students, visit                      other institutions, attend workshops and conferences on                         curricular computing, and bring consultants to campus.  At the                  end of the project, the department will sponsor a one-week                      workshop to share what has been learned with colleagues at                      other institutions.",
