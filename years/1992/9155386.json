 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 30 month project, sponsored by the Institute for Chemical                  Education (ICE) at Madison, will carry out the following                        activities:                                                                     (1) Provide a two year intensive content and pedagogy summer                    workshop program for 50 high school chemistry teachers of                       minority students in the Los Angeles area.  Activities include                  a strong follow-up program during the academic year.  This                      program will be carried out on the campus of Mt. San Antonio                    College, Walnut, California.                                                    (2) Provide a two year intensive content and pedagogy summer                    workshop program for 40 middle school teachers selected from                    a national pool.  The program includes laboratory and                           laboratory safety techniques, work with computer applications,                  study of the connections chemistry makes with other fields and                  training in outreach activities.  Participants will have the                    opportunity to work with middle school students in the UW-                      Madison ChemCamp program.                                                       (3) Provide a two year intensive summer program for 25                          teachers each year to learn how to use chemistry                                instrumentation in the classroom.  This includes 15 master                      teachers, selected from the participants in the earlier                         instrumentation program, who will be given advanced training                    in the instrumentation and be prepared to give peer workshops                   in this subject.                                                                (4) Provide a one year program for 20 elementary school                         teachers to learn chemistry concepts and activities                             appropriate for the elementary school level.  Associated with                   this program is the training of college faculty called ICE                      affiliates who will learn, through attending those sessions,                    how to carry out their own inservice program.                                                                                                                   The matching funds, contributed from the University of                          Wisconsin-Madison, constitutes 13% of the NSF grant.",
