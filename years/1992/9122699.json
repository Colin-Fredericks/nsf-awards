 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                 Program, examines ion-molecule chemistry in the quadrupole ion                  trap.  The goal of the research is to develop an understanding                  of ion-molecule chemistry as it applies to the mass                             spectrometric analysis of large organic molecules, eventually                   carbohydrate-containing antibiotics.  Initial work will                         concentrate on the laser desorption of relevant molecules into                  the quadrupole ion trap.  Substituent effects on the subsequent                 bimolecular ion-molecule reactions in the ion trap will be                      explored, with a view to exploiting these reactions for                         structural identification of large, complex organic molecules.                  %%%                                                                             Carbohydrates are extremely important molecules in biological                   systems, but the determination of their structures is very                      difficult, especially because they usually cannot be                            crystallized for X-ray structural studies.  Determination of                    structures by mass spectrometry is also difficult, since many                   interesting carbohydrates are very difficult to vaporize, and                   mass spectrometry is a gas phase technique. In this research                    project laser desorption methods will be used to place                          carbohydrates and other large organic molecules in the gas                      phase, and controlled ion-molecule reaction chemistry will be                   used to cut the large molecules into fragments by mass                          spectrometry, as required for structural analysis.",
