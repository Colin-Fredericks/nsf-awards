 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since we lack fundamental means for evaluating the merits                 of non-traditional technologies, this research looks at extending               currently impractical analytic techniques, such as conversation                 analysis, to more easily used measures of interaction                           effectiveness.  In a laboratory experiment, face-to-face                        communication will be compared with two forms of mediated                       communication:  audio-only and audio-plus-video.  Two types of                  tasks will be studied:  one with a strong visual-spatial component              and one with a strong verbal-logical component.  Task                           performance will be measured and questionnaires given.  Using                   the results of the objective measures of effectiveness, systematic,             non-anecdotal methods for conversation analysis will be                         developed using the videotaped protocols.  The research will                    make a substantial new corpus of task-related interaction available             to the scientific community.                                                          The project explores and evaluates the use of new                         techniques for measuring the effectiveness of interactive                       technologies, including teleconferencing systems, multimedia                    computing systems and portable office environments.                                   This project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                   opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    mentoring and counseling women students (in a department with                   no women faculty); teaching one course in interactive systems;                  co-leading the Interactive Systems Reading Group; advising                      students, and OGI as an institution, on policies and mechanisms                 necessary for the development of careers for women in science                   and engineering.",
