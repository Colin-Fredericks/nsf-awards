 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Taylor and his colleagues will conduct exploratory research                 to determine the feasibility of using osteocalcin to radiocarbon                date bone. The project consists of three parts. First osteocalcin               will be extracted from sample bone and its purity determined                    through analysis of amounts of Gla and Hyp present. Secondly                    osteocalcin will be extracted from bone with known age of greater               than 100,000 years and then radiocarbon dated. One would expect                 that radioactive activity would not exceed background levels.                   Finally osteocalcin will be extracted from degraded bone which                  derives from Clovis age sites (ca. 10,000 years old). This also                 will be radiocarbon dated and the accuracy of the results                       determined.                                                                                                                                                     Most of the organic fraction of bone consists of collagen and                   many experiments have shown that if this collagen is not                        seriously degraded by post depositional processes it can yield                  accurate radiocarbon ages. However it is also clear that degraded               collagen often given anomalous results. Osteocalcin is a non-                   collagen organic material which is also present in bone and                     preliminary results lead Taylor and his colleagues to believe                   that it may provide accurate dates for degraded bone. This                      preliminary exploratory project will serve to evaluate this                     approach and hopefully provide the basis for more large scale                   work.                                                                                                                                                           This research is important not only for archaeologists but other                scientists who wish to date the past. Bone is often the only                    organic material preserved in archaeological sites and other                    prehistoric contexts. While it is sometimes datable, often it is                too chemically altered to give good results. The technique                      developed here may remedy this problem.",
