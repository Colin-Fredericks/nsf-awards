 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is part of a unified plan, in progress since              1968, to increase knowledge of the classification, phylogeny, and               biogeography of harpaline carabid beetles (Carabidae:  Coleoptera).             The project includes three species level revisions:  (1) the 30                 species of the nominate subgenus of Anisodactylus; (2) the eight                species of the subgenus Anadaptus (genus Anisodactylus); and (3)                the approximately 25 North American and probably also the                       approximately 25 species from elsewhere of the subgenus Stenolophus             (genus Stenolophus).  Completion of the three species level                     revisions will allow accurate identification of adults of groups                possibly suitable for monitoring of environmental changes in                    wetlands.  The three groups were selected because comparison of                 data from the three studies will provide insights into                          biogeographical topics such as:  (1) production of new species in               refuges; (2) vicariance (splitting of ancestral species by the                  development of geographical barriers) induced by the Cochise                    Filter/barrier in the south western United States; (3) changes in               geographical ranges over time; and (4) differences in distribution              patterns of taxa in areas with and areas without once extensive                 lowland Wisconsin glaciation.  Data from the present study will be              combined with that from a former study of the genus Harpalus to                 propose and test general models for the evolution of new species                of North American carabid beetles.",
