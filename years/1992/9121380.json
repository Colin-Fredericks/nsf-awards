Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                      useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.",
