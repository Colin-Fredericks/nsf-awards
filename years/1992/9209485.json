 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies have shown that infants predict the outcome of                   moving objects in complex events from visual information.                       Typically, infants see the surfaces and obstacles that the object               will encounter and part of the action sequence itself.  The purpose             of this research is to explore whether infants can also use                     auditory cues to interpret physical events.  The research will                  focus on two questions:  (1) Can a moving object be localized by                auditory cues alone?  (2) Can the appearance of an object be                    anticipated by auditory cues?  The goal of the planning activities              is to develop and pilot test events in which auditory cues specify              the movement or appearance of an object.  Infants' reaching                     behavior in the dark will index their prediction of the location                and availability of the object.  Infants at 6.5 and 8.5 months of               age will participate in the pilot studies.  Events to be tested                 include a ball falling down stairs, a sounding object rotating on               a turntable, and the operation of a jack-in-the-box toy.  The first             two events will emphasize localization, while the last event will               explore the signalling function of sound.   Evidence that infants               can reason about events from auditory cues would support theories               of cognitive development that posit early or even innate knowledge              about the behavior of objects in the world.  Further, methodologies             that document infant cognition can provide diagnostic tools for                 early detection of cognitive deficits.",
