 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to identify and characterize                    proteins that reguate the interaction of the membrane-bound motor               molecule, myosin-I, with phospholipid surfaces such as cell                     membranes.  Myosin-I is the only motor molecule known to use a                  lipid surface as a substrate for motility, and because cellular                 movement is accompanied by motile events at the leading edge of the             cell where myosin-I is concentrated, myosin-I is a likely candidate             for driving cell movement.  To search for proteins that regulate                myosin-I, extracts from Acanthamoeba castellanii will be screened               with three in vitro assays that measure different activities of                 myosin-I:  (1), a direct binding assay, to determine the effect of              regulatory proteins on myosin-I's association with membranes; (2),              ATPase activity to evaluate the effect of regulatory proteins on                myosin-I's enzyme activity; and (3), a motility assay to observe                the effect of regulatory proteins on myosin-I's ability to move                 actin filaments.  After regulatory proteins have been identified in             these assays, specific proteins will be purified using standard                 biochemical procedures and polyclonalantibodies to each of these                proteins will be produced.  These antibodies will be used in the                above assays to test their effect on regulatory protein activities              and in cells to localize the regulatory proteins by immunostaining.             These experiments will provide important information on how                     myosin-I is organized at the cell membrane and how myosin-I's                   activity is regulated.                                                          %%%                                                                             Cellular motility is fundamental to the life processes of                       unicellular organisms and essential to many physiological                       activities of higher organisms, such as development, neuronal                   growth, angiogenesis, defense mechanisms, wound healing, and                    organismal locomotion.  Cellular movement requires the coordination             of membrane and cytoskeletal systems.  As a result of its lipid-                binding properties, the cytoskeletal motor protein myosin-I has                 been implicated in many membrane-mediated motile processes.                     However, unlike other motor proteins (e.g., myosin-II, kinesin, or              dynein) it has not been possible thus far to show that mysoin-I is              required for some generalized cellular process.  The problem of                 what myosin-I does may not be easily solved solely by studying                  mysoin-I, since it appears likely that multiple genes encode a                  family of myosin-I molecules with overlapping functions.  The                   results of this study will contribute to the understanding of                   myosin-I's role in cell motility.",
