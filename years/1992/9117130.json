 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support collaborative research involving             Yngve Ohrn and Erik Deumens of the University of Florida, Lucas                 Lathouwers of the University of Antwerp, and Jean-Marie Andre of                the University of Our Lady of Peace in Namur, Belgium.  The                     proposed research deals with time-dependent studies of electron and             nuclear dynamics in molecular systems.  In order to predict                     electron transfer rates and to distinguish between various transfer             mechanisms, the investigators propose to use time-dependent                     variational principles and model wavefunctions for electrons.                   Electron transfer as a general phenomenon affects our thinking in               virtually all areas of chemistry and in many areas of biology.                                                                                                  Prior collaboration between Yngve Ohrn and Dr. Lathouwer's                      group at Antwerp has been highly productive and covered the                     development of theory and computational methods for the study of                these processes at the submolecular level.  The investigators                   propose to continue their theoretical work and modeling and apply               the time-dependent methodology to extended polymeric systems.                   Dr. Andre's group provides the necessary expertise on polymer                   codes and polymeric systems.  The project will continue to benefit              from Dr. Lathouwer's expertise on model wavefunctions.  These                   combined efforts will advance our understanding of the dynamics                 of electron transfer and contribute significantly to modern concepts            in theoretical chemistry.",
