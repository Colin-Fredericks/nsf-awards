 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program provides continued support for the research program of                  Dr. John E. Bercaw of the Chemistry Department, California                      Institute of Technology.  The research will focus on the                        mechanisms of reactions of organometallic compounds.  Selective                 catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons and other organic                           substrates will be investigated in detail.  Kinetic and                         thermodynamic factors which influence the formation and                         cleavage of C-O, H-O, and M-O or M=O bonds will be emphasized,                  as well as 1,2 addition reactions to C-H bonds.                                 Cyclopentadienyl compounds of tantalum and high valent                          ruthenium and iron oxo compounds which contain ancilliary                       O,O,O-tripodal ligands will be used.                                            %%%                                                                             Conversion of methane and other light alkanes to liquids, such                  as alcohols or higher hydrocarbons, could simplify transport of                 these energy sources and enable the first step of their                         conversion to specialty chemical products.  By developing new                   types of transtion metal compounds which are capable of                         oxidizing organic substrates and providing a better                             understanding of the kinetic and thermodynamic factors                          operative in these reactions, improved oxidation catalysts may                  be developed.  During the course of these fundamental studies,                  new compounds will be synthesized and careful investigations of                 the steps of the oxidation reactions will be carried out.",
