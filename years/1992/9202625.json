Whitney and                   Saito will utilize Whitney's expertise in the chemistry and structure           of coal to develop models for the flow and production of coalbed                methane.                                                                                                                                                        Coalbed methane is a largely wasted fuel resource which recently                has become a significant contributor to the U.S. domestic natural               gas supply.  In order to develop accurate simulations and                       assessments of this resource, basic research is needed on the                   multicomponent desorption, diffusion, and flow effects which                    largely determine the composition and production of coalbed                     methane.  The experimental opportunities as well as pre-existing                data on coalbed and gas properties of methane at Dr. Saito's                    laboratory will complement Dr. Whitney's experience in modelling                the physical processes of coal.  Because of its policy to increase              energy efficiency and improve the utilization of wasted energy, the             Japanese government is encouraging the research of Dr. Saito so as              to develop a strong capability in fuel resources assessment.",
