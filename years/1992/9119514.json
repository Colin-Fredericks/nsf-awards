 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator, Dr. Leon Golub of the                          Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, has coordinated a campaign               to study the three-dimensional structure of the solar corona at                 the 11 July 1991 total eclipse.  In addition to utilizing a                     series of ground-based observations, his campaign included a                    flight of the NIXT high resolution x-ray telescope sounding                     rocket payload, which coincided with totality as observed from                  the solar telescope in Hawaii.  Their goal is to study the                      structure of the inner corona with arcsecond spatial resolution,                and to determine both the connections made by the coronal                       structure to the Solar surface and the manner in which the inner                coronal structure determines that of the outer corona normally                  seen at eclipse.  They now will combine datasets which see the                  outer Solar atmosphere from the photospheric level, throught the                inner corona and out to 6 Rsol.                                                 The campaign included a large number of ground-based observing                  teams, some of whom are mounting campaigns specifically for this                eclipse while others are providing more routine data, but are                   making a special point of observing in conjunction with the                     eclipse.  These teams include, among others, the 2.2m U. of                     Hawaii and the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii telescopes at Mauna Kea                for spectrally-resolved high spatial resolution data, the Multi-                station experiment for similar data spread out over several hours               of observing, spectroscopic data from Sac Peak, spectroheliograms               from Sac Peak and Kitt Peak, vector magnetic field data from the                Marshall Space Flight Center and from Big Bear Solar Observatory,               observation of Fe XIV by HAO located in Hawaii for the eclipse,                 as well as many other more routine datasets.  In this proposal                  they are requesting only support for activities related to the                  massive task of coordinating the ground-based data reduction and                analysis effort related specifically to the above work.",
