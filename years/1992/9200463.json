 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support mathematical research focusing on                  three problem areas.  The first continues work on quasiconformal                maps defined on manifolds.  These maps play an essential role in                understanding transformations of Euclidean space whose local                    distortions lie within fixed limits.  The extension to manifolds                such as the Heisenberg group is new, providing a potentially                    valuable tool in the harmonic analysis of semi-simple or                        nilpotent Lie groups.  In addition, the manifolds under                         consideration form boundaries of strongly pseudoconvex domains in               several complex variables.  It then becomes natural to ask (as                  was in the real variable case) for conditions on when these                     quasiconformal maps can be extended.  Many of the real-variable                 methods do not carry over.  Nevertheless, some of the main                      results do.  Work will concentrate on isolating conditions which                will give the extension result.                                                      A second line of research involving symmetric spaces                       concerns domains formed by symmetric cones and tube domains. At                 issue is whether or not on can obtain all symmetric tubes by a                  Jordan algebra construction.  If this can be done, then it is                   likely that current results available for convex cones can be                   carried over to the non-convex.  This will have particular                      implications for representation theory.                                              The third area of investigation will consider harmonic                     functions on Riemann surfaces and on discrete structures.                       Efforts will be made to carry over some of the classical one-                   variable function theory to complete Riemann spaces.  Of special                interest is the use of a generalized area integral which can be                 defined on these spaces.  Using this integral work will be done                 in determining those function spaces for which the area integral                gives the same Hardy class as the traditional maximal function.",
