 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is an interdisciplinary study to identify and             to quantify biological chemicals that affect ecological                         relationships among benthic antarctic marine invertebrates.  This               research is a continuation of a program that succeeded in                       documenting a moderate incidence of chemical influence on                       ecological relationships in polar communities, contrary to                      contemporary theory that suggests an inverse relationship between               latitude and incidence of chemical defense.  This project extends               the scope of that earlier study by addressing the chemical nature               of defensive agents.  The objectives are to isolate and to                      characterize biologically active chemicals from previously                      identified invertebrates with chemical defense mechanisms.  The                 goals are to evaluate the role of these chemicals as feeding                    deterrents, anti-fouling agents or overgrowth inhibitory chemicals,             to determine the biological origin of these chemical metabolites,               and to examine the storage of defensive agents in specific tissues              or mucus.  Ecologically significant bioassays will guide the                    analytical isolation and characterization of identified defense                 metabolites.  The proposed research will enhance our understanding              and significance of defense metabolites in the ecology of antarctic             marine benthos, a changing paradigm.",
