 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Department of Physics is purchasing equipment for weather                  monitoring and forecasting to support a course in Introductory                  Meteorology which is taken by non-science majors to meet                        graduation requirements.  The lab includes a computerized local                 weather station and satellite receiving system to take                          advantage of low cost, real-time data sources.  Additionally,                   a meteorological workstation has dial-up access to a                            meteorological database to demonstrate the extensive data and                   analysis available.  Students and instructors use the lab's                     sources to create daily weather briefings for class.  Live                      local weather conditions and satellite imagery are displayed in                 the Physics Department hall display case to create interest in                  weather and science for the general student population.  Topics                 of atmospheric stability, surface weather map analysis, upper                   air analysis, frontal analysis, atmospheric motion,                             instrumentation, and radiative energy exchange are taught in                    the lab, enhancing the student's understanding of the physical                  processes that influence daily weather.",
