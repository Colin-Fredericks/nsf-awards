 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effectiveness of a membrane in a separation process is                      based on the degree of its selectivity and its permeability or                  throughput.  Unfortunately, selectivity and permeability are                    generally traded off - the same mechanisms which control                        selectivity, such as pore size, regulate the flux of material                   through the membrane.  This SGER proposal suggests fabricating                  composite membranes in order to maximize both selectivity and                   permeability.  A porous substrate is used as the backing                        material thus providing mechanical strength and insuring high                   permeability.  Selectivity is then controlled by mounting a                     nonporous ultrathin microstructured film over the backing                       sheet.                                                                                                                                                          The PI suggests making these microstructured films out of                       cohesive, molecularly ordered, organic mono- or multi-layered                   films formed either by the Langmuir Blodgett technique or self                  assembly via adsorption from solution.  The permeability of                     these films to gases of interest will be measured by using                      either a quartz crystal microbalance or a surface acoustic                      wave device.  In this type of measurement this film is                          attached to a (typically) quartz piezoelectric crystal, and an                  oscillating electric field is applied to the crystal.  This                     application causes an acoustic wave to propagate with a                         particular resonant frequency.  Minute changes in mass of the                   film can be detected by shifts in the resonant frequency of                     the crystal.  The film will be exposed to a gaseous                             environment, and frequency shifts will be measured in time in                   order to measure the permeability.  The study will focus on                     how the microstructure architecture and physicochemical                         properties of the films relate to the permeability.                             Specifically films of different fluidity, surface                               characteristic, chemistries and defect structure will be                        examines.",
