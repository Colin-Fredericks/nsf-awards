 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Hungary research project between Dr. Gerald D.                          Fasman of Brandeis University and Dr. Miklos Hollosi of                         the Institute of Organic Chemistry, Budapest, Hungary                           involves synthesis and study of the conformation of                             glycopeptides.  The researchers will synthesize model                           compounds in both classes; N- and O-glycosidic model B-                         turn tetrapeptides.  Once prepared, the researchers will                        investigate the conformation of these model compounds by                        physical-biochemical techniques, including circular                             dichroisim, nuclear magnetic resonance and infra-red                            spectroscopy.  They will use conformational energy                              calculations by the MMPMI (1985) to assist in                                   conformational assignments.  The roles of glycoproteins                         have been shown to play important roles in biological                           processes, however, little research has been carried out                        on the role of conformation in the various biological                           fluctuations.  Results should improve our understanding of                      the role that carbohydrates play in glycoprotein function                       and conformation.                                                                                                                                               This project in biochemistry fulfills the program                               objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                      combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas                       of strong mutual interest and competence.",
