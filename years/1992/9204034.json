 "awd_abstract_narration": "More accurate meteorological data is required for many of the                   research efforts planned as part of the World Ocean Circulation                 Experiment (WOCE), which will begin field experiments in 1992.                  Although many sensors are available commercially, their accuracy                and calibration for ships and buoys had not been tested until                   recently.  Work completed in an initial grant to the PI's (OCE-87-              09614) quantified the performance characteristics of some buoy and              ship sensors, and cooperation between the PI's and manufacturers                resulted in improvements to these sensors.  Development of a data               logging system that is applicable to any sensor was also completed              and licensed to a commercial manufacturer.  The improved sensor                 system is known as IMET, for Improved METeorological.  This grant               provides funding for the final documentation of the recently                    developed IMET sensor system.  This documentation will allow the                rest of the oceanographic community to install and maintain the                 IMET system on a variety of research vessels.",
