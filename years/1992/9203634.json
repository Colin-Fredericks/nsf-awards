 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Robert J. Hinde has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship                  in Chemistry. Dr. Hinde's doctoral degree was from The                          University of Chicago with Professor Stephen Berry. Dr. Hinde                   intends to continue his research with Professor Gregory Ezra at                 Cornell University.  Dr. Hinde's postdoctoral research will be                  an investigation into questions of phase space transport and                    trapping in chemically interesting multimode Hamiltonian                        systems. This will help prepare him for his career goal of                      establishing an active research program focussing on                            intramolecular energy flow and the quantum mechanical behavior                  of chaotic dynamical systems.                                                   %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                    knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                   meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
