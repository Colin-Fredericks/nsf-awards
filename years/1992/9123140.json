 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been known that plasmodesmata are involved in the              symplastic transport of solutes between adjacent plant cells.  The              overall aim of this project is to study the compositional,                      structural and functional organization of plasmodesmata in higher               plants.  Recent data have suggested that proteins present in                    plasmodesmata may resemble connexin proteins present in the gap                 junctions of animal cells.  Gap junctions are involved in the                   symplastic movement of ions and perhaps small molecules between                 animal cells.  The hypothesis being tested in this proposal is that             plant connexins reside in plasmodesmata and are involved in                     intercellular transport processes.                                                                                                                              The primary thrust of this project is to produce and purify a panel             of monospecific antibodies directed against protein motifs present              in a putative plant connexin that has already been obtained from                a cDNA expression library from Arabidopsis.  The antibodies will                be used in ultrastructural immunolocalizations, with the aim of                 demonstrating their specific distribution in or around                          plasmodesmata. Later, the antibodies will be used in a fluorescent              dye transport assay, where their specific associations with                     plasmodesmatal components are expected to block intercellular                   movement of the fluorochrome.  Collectively, these studies will                 contribute to our understanding about the structural organization               and functional roles connexin-like proteins in plasmodesmata.",
