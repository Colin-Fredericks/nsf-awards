 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is               in the general area of instrumentation development in the subfield              of mass spectrometry.  The combination of gas chromatography with               mass spectrometry (GC/MS) provides the best general purpose                     analytical instrument for sensitive characterization of complex                 mixtures.  It is used in fields of science and technology.  In                  most cases, the gas chromatograph separates the starting mixture                into its constituent compounds prior to analysis by the mass                    spectrometer.  The separation step is the most time-consuming                   part of the analysis, often taking an hour, while mass analysis                 for each constituent is complete in a second or less.                                                                                                           This project provides a method for the direct mass spectroscopic                analysis of mixtures and can speed overall analysis time by                     reducing the degree of chromatographic separation.  The                         investigators use a novel ionization modulation scheme that                     increases the amount of chemically useful information obtained                  from a mass spectrometer.  The system is automated and supports                 computerized deconvolution of the resultant two-dimensional                     spectra.                                                                                                                                                        The Phase I program addresses optimization of the instrument                    design by maximizing the data acquisition rate (while maintaining               good signal-to-noise ratios over a large dynamic range),                        determining the limits to sensitivity, determining the optimum                  electron energy resolution and selecting the best algorithm for                 computerized data reduction.",
