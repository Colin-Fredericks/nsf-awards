 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work done on this project divides into two categories,                     problems arising from oscillatory integral theory and those                     arising from the theory of weights.  Both are tied to the                       analysis of partial differential equations in various guises.                   The oscillatory integrals reflect the propagation of                            singularities of linear partial differential equations.  Using                  the FBI-transformation, work will be done in determining                        regularity of complex vector fields, extending earlier results of               Hormander.  Other work will focus on Lebesgue and Sobolev                       estimates for Airy-type integrals applicable to boundary problems               for wave equations.  Further refinement of research on weighted                 integrals will be used to obtain estimates on nodal sets and                    eigenfunctions along lines initiated by Fefferman and Donnelly.                 It is expected that one can use Carleman-type inequalities to                   improve estimates on the eigenfunctions.  Additional work will                  done on inverse boundary value problems to seek an existence                    counterexample for the case where the potential has a large weak                type norm.                                                                           Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them and validate methods for                     expressing solutions.",
