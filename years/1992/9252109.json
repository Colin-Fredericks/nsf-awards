 "awd_abstract_narration": "A single-channel spectrograph currently used for astronomical                   spectroscopy introduces limitations into the kind and quality                   of experiments which may be performed, and is not                               representative of the ability of multichannel detectors which                   are becoming widespread in laboratory physics and especially in                 astronomical imaging at many institutions.  The current                         experiments at Middlebury are being revised and improved using                  a modern, sensitive multichannel detector (CCD array camera)                    and extended to fainter astronomical objects, including solar                   system objects and the brighter stars.  This is done by the                     assembly of a bench-mounted spectrograph and an optical fiber                   feed from the telescope to the spectrograph.  The techniques                    and instruments developed make possible a wide variety of                       highly educational lab exercises for physics and astronomy                      undergraduates, and creates student-faculty research                            opportunities in the field of precision stellar radial                          velocities.  The instrumentation being developed emphasizes                     modularity and flexibility and is being documented and                          publicized in a manner that will help any institution with a                    modest telescope incorporate astronomical spectroscopy into its                 undergraduate program.",
