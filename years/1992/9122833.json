 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of experiments will be conducted to investigate the                    apparent suppressive effect of incorporated crimson clover                      (Trifolium incarnatum L.) residue on the growth of lambsquarters                (Chenopodium album L.) in a corn (Zea mays L.) cropping system.                 Measurements of above and below ground plant parts will document                specific effects of a crimson clover nitrogen source on the                     growth, development, and nitrogen uptake of sweet corn and                      lambsquarters, grown in pure and mixed cultures.  Companion                     growth chamber and field studies will examine emergence and time                to emergence of both species under a regime of clover-derived                   nitrogen.  Is low nitrogen availability responsible for                         previously observed suppressive effects on emergence?  A field                  study will test for interactive effects of crimson clover residue               and ammonium nitrate addition on lambsquarters growth and                       nitrogen uptake after emergence.  The results of these studies                  will aid in the effective management of legumes in cropping                     systems and provide insight on how temporal availability of                     resources affects patterns of consumption and growth and,                       ultimately, outcomes of competitive interactions between plants.",
