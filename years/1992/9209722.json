 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key factor in determining investment policy, liquidation policy,              and the consequences of financial distress is the set of rules                  governing bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy rules affect firms in financial               distress in two ways.  First, it is obvious that they affect the                outcome of the bankruptcy proceeding.  Second, they establish the               alternative to an out-of-bankruptcy settlement and so affect the                nature of such settlements.  The likely outcomes of both informal               bargaining and formal bankruptcy, in turn, affect the availability              of funds for investment and the types of investments equity holders             will pursue.  More specifically, poorly conceived bankruptcy rules              may make it impossible for investors to earn a fair return, even                in situations where the investment is economically viable.  Also,               bankruptcy rules may encourage or discourage inefficient                        investments.  Finally the bankruptcy regime affects the extent to               which firms are forced to liquidate assets even when the \"going                 concern\" value of the assets is higher than the outstanding debt.               The purpose of the research is to guide the policy debate                       surrounding bankruptcy by suggesting some features of an optimal                bankruptcy law based on these considerations.                                                                                                                   The research method is novel in how it regards optimal bankruptcy               law as one element in the broader problem of designing optimal                  financial contracts.  Such contracts specify how resources are to               be allocated between investors and firms.  Actual financial                     contracts usually stipulate only (possibly contingent) payments to              investors.  The rules governing the breach of stipulated promises               are, in fact, typically not specified in the contract explicitly.               They are generally contained in the legal system and are implicitly             a part of every contract.  For example, debt contracts specify the              debtholder's investment, the specific payments to which he is                   entitled, and covenants restricting the debtor's behavior.                      Bankruptcy law provides a procedure to be followed if the promised              payments are not made or if the covenants are violated.  In view                of this concern, security design will be examined as including both             explicit promises and the procedures to be followed in case of                  breach, and optimal bankruptcy rules will be derived as part of an              overall contract design problem.",
