 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research will be conducted in a number of areas of                  statistical physics.  The orientational ordering of icosahedral                 fullerene molecules will be studied using mean field theory.                    Intermolecular potentials will be studied which can explain the                 orientationally ordered structure and from which a calculation of               the librational excitation spectrum can be undertaken.  This will               help explain future inelastic neutron scattering experiments.                   Research will also be done on the way quantum fluctuations select               a ground state out of a manifold of states which classically would              be degenerate.  This work will be based on the use of degenerate                perturbation theory to construct an effective interaction mediated              by quantum fluctuations.  Additional research, motivated by the                 magnetic properties of the copper oxide materials, will be done on              the effects of various types of localized magnetic defects at low               defect densities.  Work will also be done on interpreting the                   observed properties of antiferromagnets on a kagome lattice by                  using high temperature expansions.                                              %%%                                                                             A variety of projects will be undertaken in condensed matter                    physics using statistical mechanics techniques.  These projects                 have to do with the recently discovered solid carbon-sixty and the              copper oxide high temperature superconductors.  These condensed                 matter systems pose difficult and intriguing problems which push                the limits of conventional condensed matter theory and, at the same             time, hold high potential for real applications.  Successful                    completion of this work will provide a significant contribution to              this field.",
