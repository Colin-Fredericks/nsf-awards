 "awd_abstract_narration": "A small area of the eastern Pacific, to the west of the Sierra             Madre Mountains of Mexico, is a favored location for tropical cy-               clogenesis. Currently accepted theories of tropical cyclone form-               ation involve the preexistence of a cyclonic disturbance in the                 prevailing easterly tropical flow, over an adequately warm sea sur-             face, as a necessary (but not sufficent) condition for the incep-               tion of hurricanes. Zehnder and Gall propose to continue to explore             their hypothesis that flow over the mountains of central Mexico                 provides, under suitable angles of attack, cyclonic distortion of               the flow downstream of the orographic obstacle . Their previous                 research has shown that certain standing and slowly traveling                   waves, interacting with the topography, are more active in years                with above average numbers of tropical cyclones in this region.                 They have also demonstrated theoretically that such planetary-scale             waves can generate a steady lee-side trough of realistically small              scale and trains of secondary traveling synoptic-scale waves which              may serve as the initial locations of tropical cyclones. They                   propose to employ numerical model simulations as well as further                analyses of observational data sets, including one to be obtained               in the area during the summer of 1991, in their continuation of the             research. The question as to why tropical cyclones like to form off             the west coast of Mexico is not only interesting for its own sake.              Its answer should also shed light on tropical cyclogenesis in                   general, and could lead to improvements in hurricane forecasting.",
