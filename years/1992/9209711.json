 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last three decades there has been a revolution in                 general topology and the theory of Boolean algebras, brought about              by powerful new techniques in set theory, including the method of               forcing pioneered by Paul J. Cohen, and by deep studies in the                  structure of inner models of set theory and large cardinals.  At                the same time, there has been striking progress in the theory of                compact Hausdorff spaces, and it is not always easy to see in                   advance whether extra set-theoretic assumptions are required.  The              investigator intends to continue his research on compact Hausdorff              spaces, including the application of special set-theoretic tools.               Other classes of spaces receiving attention will be the related                 classes of countably compact and sequentially compact spaces, Moore             spaces, non-metrizable manifolds, Frechet-Urysohn topological                   groups and topological vector spaces, countably metacompact spaces,             and weak and weak* compact subsets of Banach spaces.  Finite group              actions on normal spaces will also receive some attention.                           General topology is more of a foundational subject than the                rest of topology, concerning itself with very abstract spaces and               with the impact on topology of the adoption of variants of the                  axioms of set theory.  Although analogies to familiar objects of                geometry are valuable heuristics, the plastic, intuitive kind of                geometry involving low-dimensional manifolds is a far cry from the              study of subsets of a Banach space, the latter being more closely               related to classical analysis than to geometry, in spite of the                 geometric terminology employed.  One major result of general                    topology in which Nyikos was involved a decade ago was the                      discovery that a famous unproved conjecture concerning Moore spaces             was actually independent of the usual basic axioms of set theory.               Moreover, it was shown to be inconsistent with the Cantor Continuum             Hypothesis, a far more familiar proposition that most working                   mathematicians would be likely to choose if they had to make a                  choice.  This result suggests the flavor of the best general                    topology.",
