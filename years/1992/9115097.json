 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. William Bowman is Director of the University of                        Colorado's Mountain Research Station, located at 2900 meters                    elevation in the Front Range of the Rockies near the Continental                Divide.  The Niwot Ridge area near the Station is an alpine                     tundra study area that is designated an NSF-supported Long-Term                 Ecological Research Site, an Experimental Ecological Reserve by                 the U.S. Forest Service and the Institute of Ecology, and a                     Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO and the U.S. State Department.  Dr.                 Bowman requests support for purchase of two snowmobiles for                     research use, an upgrade of their weather station equipment, and                winterization of the Station's water supply system.                                  The proposed equipment acquisitions and site improvements to               the Mountain Research Station would make it possible for research               projects to operate during the winter months, and would increase                the quality and quantity of environmental data gathered at the                  Station.  Research on the fragile tundra environment is                         especially critical to our understanding of global climate                      change.  This field station has supported leading research in                   this area, and continued improvement to this facility will                      enhance future research significantly.",
