 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research, carried out in an undergraduate                     institution, is to study the cardiotonic glycosides alpha- and                  beta-antiarin, components of dart poisons isolated from the                     latex of Antiaris toxicaria.  The specific aims of the project                  are to test whether the antiarins and related secondary                         metabolites evolved as defense chemicals versus insect                          herbivores, to characterize any anti-insectan activity, to                      study the specific mode of action of the poisons as a guide to                  biorational pesticide development, to investigate the                           similarity of the antiarins to ouabain, a known inhibitor of                    membrane-bound NA+/K+ ATPase and to ascertain which structural                  units in ouabain and the antarins represent the sources of                      anti-insectan activity.                                                         %%%                                                                             With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award,                   the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.                 David P. Richardson of the Department of Chemistry at Williams                  College.  Professor Richardson will focus his work on carrying                  out rigorous chemical and biological studies on the dart                        poisons derived from the latex of Antiaris toxicaria, a tree                    indigenous to Borneo.  The project offers exceptional                           opportunities for student participation in the areas of                         chemical separation, structural analysis and synthetic                          chemistry.",
