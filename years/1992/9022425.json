 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viviparity has an intriguing interface with reptilian thermal           biology.  Reptiles behaviorally regulate their body temperature.                Thus, developing embryos of oviparous species are subject to the                same body temperature as their mother only until oviposition, while             developing embryos of viviparous species are subject to mother's                body temperature throughout development.  Because thermal                       requirements of females and embryos are not identical, interests                of mothers and offspring may be in conflict.  The resolution of                 this conflict is an important component in the evolution of                     viviparity and of present day interactions between mothers of                   viviparous species and their developing embryos.  The proposed                  research is directed towards two major questions.                                       Has the evolution of viviparity been constrained by                     conservative thermal tolerances of embryos?  Viviparity has evolved             from oviparity in almost 100 lineages of snakes and lizards, and                it is favored in cool climates where increased egg retention                    requires more favorable thermal environment for embryonic                       development than nests.   However, an evolutionary shift from                   oviparity to viviparity is possible only if embryonic development               is not compromised by the environment imposed by the pregnant                   female.  The investigator will evaluate temperature tolerances of               embryos of oviparous lizards from linages where it has not.  The                hypothesis to be tested is that viviparity is more likely to evolve             in lineages where thermal requirements of females and thermal                   tolerances of their embryos are similar than in lineages where they             differ.                                                                                 Is the thermoregulation by pregnant females of viviparous               species constrained by thermal tolerances of embryos?  Temperatures             selected by pregnant females of viviparous lizards differ from                  those selected by non.pregnant females.  Are shifts in body                     temperatures associated with pregnancy related to adult body                    temperatures per se?  This research will evaluate diel temperature              profiles of viviparous lizards when pregnant and not pregnant.  The             hypothesis to be tested is that species that exhibit relatively                 high body temperatures when active alter their thermal behavior                 more when pregnant than closely related species that exhibit                    relatively low body temperatures.  Rejection of this hypothesis for             all or some lineages would suggest thermal tolerances of embryos                are more labile than laboratory studies predict or that thermal                 tolerances of embryos evolve rapidly.",
