Due to their high tensile strength, durability,                                 and superior fatigue behavior, composite                                        materials have been increasingly applied in civil                               engineering constructions.  One of such                                         applications involves the use of fiber-glass                                    reinforcement, sheets, or wires for seismic                                     repair or strengthening of existing structures.                                 Some success of such techniques has been                                        demonstrated in several case applications                                       around the world.                                                                                                                                               The use of glass-fiber reinforced techniques                                    have been successfully tested in strengthening                                  of reinforced concrete structural members such                                  as beams and bridge-column piers.  However,                                     the feasibility of such similar applications to                                 unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings--one of                                    the nation's most vulnerable existing building                                  stocks to seismic hazard--has not been seriously                                explored.  This project ventures into such a                                    new research area where there is a potential to                                 develop a technically-sound and cost-effective                                  engineering measure to strengthen existing                                      URM buildings in the nation's seismic regions.                                                                                                                  The objective of this exploratory research                                      project is to demonstrate the feasibility of                                    seismic strengthening of URM structures by                                      epoxy-bonding composite fibers to the exterior                                  surfaces of the structure.  The focus of the                                    study are:  (a) to determine the bond behavior                                  of composite fabrics to masonry, and (b) to                                     study the effectiveness of glass fibers as low-                                 cost reinforcement materials.",
