 "awd_abstract_narration": "The experiences of all humans are tied to the Earth, its                   processes and materials, and an understanding of this                           relationship is critical to the ability of individuals and                      society to make informed decisions about environmental issues.                  Unfortunately, the current level of earth-science illiteracy in                 the United States indicates that the nature and history of human-               environment interactions is not adequately understood.  The                     proposed research represents the initial stages of an                           interdisciplinary program to review and analyze aspects of the                  interaction between humans and the environment in North America                 from a geologic perspective.  Focusing initially on the American                Southwest, this study will examine the idea that the physical                   environment and its study directly influenced human (Native                     American and Euro-American) perceptions of landscape and, in                    turn, land use through time.  The record of human-environment                   interactions will be evaluated using historical review of                       geologic studies and other primary and secondary literature                     (e.g., in anthropology, history, or geography), and field study.                The proposed program will contribute a geologic context by which                Earth-human interactions through time can be considered.  The                   interdisciplinary nature of this study also has the potential to                increase the accessibility of earth science to a wider, more                    culturally diverse audience.",
