 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research has two complementary tracks; automatic generation                of analog macromodels, and algorithms for analog multi-level                    simulation.  The focus of the first track is on integrating                     macromodel optimization techniques with algorithms capable of                   generating macromodel topologies.  Algorithms for generating analog             macromodels from circuit level representations are being sought.                Software embodying the algorithms is tailored to fit into an                    ordinary simulator's description language (e.g. SPICE3).  A set of              macromodels for common analog functions is being constructed.  The              critical problem for analog multi-level simulation is the inclusion             of behavioral models in a simulation environment.  Issues being                 addressed are: the use of \"C\" language, simulation synchronization,             and circuit partitioning.  A second problem is the inclusion of                 digital blocks in the multi-level simulation system.  Here signal               conversion from one domain to another is being explored.  One                   approach being investigated is obtaining an extension of                        conventional Boolean algebra to real valued signals.  This offers               a simple way to include both analog and digital functions in a                  unified simulation environment.",
