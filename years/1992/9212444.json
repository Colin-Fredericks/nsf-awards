 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction of high energy                                                  femtosecond through picosecond laser                                            pulses with solid targets provides                                              a bright source of incoherent soft                                              X-rays.  In this Engineering                                                    Research Equipment Grant, two                                                   experiments are described which                                                 employ the interaction of energetic                                             femtosecond through 100 ps pulses                                               with solid targets.  These                                                      experiments require the use of soft                                             X-ray spectrometer (~10-400A range)                                             to monitor the hot plasma emission.                                             The first experiment has as its aim                                             the efficient and high average power                                            generation of 0.1-1 KeV X-rays for                                              eventual application to soft X-ray                                              lithography.  By preparing                                                      appropriately shaped and sized short                                            plasma density scalelengths and                                                 adjusting the input polarization,                                               pulse length, and incidence angle of                                            a short laser pulse of ~2-20 mJ                                                 energy, the generation of 0.1-1 KeV                                             X-rays with at least 10% efficiency                                             is expected.  This will provide a                                               proof-of-principle for scaling to                                               very high repetition rate laser                                                 systems.  A second use for the                                                  spectrometer will be the monitoring                                             of soft X-ray emission from                                                     femtosecond laser-produced plasmas.                                             This has applications in the                                                    production of an ultrashort pulse X-                                            ray source and in the study of the                                              unique, high-density, non-ideal                                                 plasmas produced in the interaction.",
