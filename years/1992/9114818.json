 "awd_abstract_narration": "Across the country there are data suggesting that, among the                    mentally ill, homelessness is associated with increased criminal                behavior.  The research literature to date suggests that neither                mental disorder nor homelessness alone adequately accounts for an               increase in risk for violent crime.  Studies, however, linking the              homeless mentally ill with violent crime raise the possibility that             homelessness and mental disorder interact in some volatile way.                 What might explain this relationship?  It is possible that factors              associated with homelessness may place the mentally ill at                      increased risk for violent criminal behavior.  Alternatively, the               homeless mentally ill may simply receive differential treatment by              the criminal justice and forensic mental health systems.                        Criminological theory suggests that it is not increased risk of                 dangerous behavior, but an increased vulnerability to arrest that               accounts for these patterns.                                                                                                                                    Using a case-control design, this study seeks to explore this issue             systematically.  Two sub-studies are planned.  The first project                examines \"risk\" by exploring the contribution of homelessness to                violent criminal behavior in the mentally ill.  Data from 150                   homeless and 150 domiciled mentally disordered offenders will be                examined.  The second project explores \"criminalization\" by                     discriminating between two groups of homeless mentally ill persons:             150 who have a history of criminal behavior and 150 matched control             persons who do not.  The data will be derived from court records,               hospital records, patient and family interviews, and standard                   diagnostic instruments.  This study promises to add substantially               to our knowledge of the role of homelessness in mediating the link              between mental illness and violent criminal behavior.  It will not              only break new ground but also lay the foundation for future                    prospective studies of the causes of violence in society.",
