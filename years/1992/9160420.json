 "awd_abstract_narration": "Field Flow Fractionation (FFF) has been demonstrated as a                       high speed analytical tool for separation and                                   characterization of macromolecules, biopolymers, and cell                       particles in the size range of 0.01 to 50 microns.                              Filtration is a widely accepted technique for simple                            purification and is commonly practiced in many analytical                       and biological research laboratories.  Coupling these two                       bio-compatible techniques in a two dimensional                                  multi-channel design will significantly increase the                            power, selectivity, separation speed, throughput, and                           analytical information related to the analytes.  Extension                      and commercialization of this technology for preparative                        scale application offers a new bio-compatible, rapid                            separation, characterization, and purification system for                       meeting the needs in bio-polymer, cell, and subcellular                         research.                                                                                                                                                       Two dimensional multi-channel design involves the use of                        membranes with decreasing pore size in a stacked assembly.                      Purified fractions would be collected at the outlet of                          each channel.  This project focuses on membrane and                             multi-channel detector technology, and the feasibility of                       commercialization of this multi-channel universal                               biopolymer purification system.",
