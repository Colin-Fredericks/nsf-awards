 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves enhancement of the Flight Controls Design                 Laboratory (CONLAB) to facilitate undergraduate experiments                     related to flight control design and testing in the general                     area of aeronautical engineering.  The flight control design is                 for a small hovercraft and consists of integrating motion                       sensors and propulsive control with a computer so that the                      hovercraft is capable of autonomous flight.  The first                          experiment will stabilize the hovercraft using a gyro, the                      second will give the hovercraft directional control in heading,                 and the third will provide navigation capability via satellite                  positioning.  The satellite positioning will be provided by                     Global Positioning System sensors which are now available at                    low cost to universities.  The grant is for the acquisition of                  major instrumentation : sensors, interface hardware, and                        systems software required for simulation and test.  Emphasis in                 the experiments is on systems design and integration.  The                      hardware interface and software algorithms required are open-                   ended, iterative design tasks.  Students will work in teams and                 observe the differences between system simulation on a computer                 and system test using a prototype vehicle.  The purpose of the                  experiments is to apply the theory in a team oriented fashion                   allowing considerable creativity in the process.  This also                     will give the students exposure to the systems integration                      problems that they will meet in industry.",
