The role of two                                      photon excitation in the enhancement of                                         the third order nonlinearities will be                                          investigated in detail.  Specific conjugated                                    polymers such as polydiacetylenes are                                           known to have extremely large nonlinear                                         refrafctive indices along with low                                              absorption coefficients in the off-resonant                                     domain.  Such large nonlinearities are                                          obtained only if the polymer chains are                                         organized as a single crystal.  Specific                                        organic molecular crystals such as                                              nitroanilines have very large and stable                                        second order nonlinearities which can be                                        utilized in many applications, (e.g., SHG of                                    infrared diode lasers), if single crystal films                                 and waveguides can be prepared.  A                                              method (\u001ashear method\u001a) that we have                                            recently established will be utilized for the                                   preparation of single crystal films of these                                    optical materials.  Subsequently specific                                       waveguide microstructures will be                                               prepared from the films.  The nonlinear                                         optical measurements in the films and                                           waveguides will be performed using                                              established procedures.  As recent                                              measurements have shown, single crystal                                         polydiacetylene waveguides are highly                                           promising for applications in all-optical                                       switches and logic gates that will operate                                      at the subpicosecond time scale.  Similarly                                     various other applications are expected of                                      single crystal waveguides of organic                                            second order optical materials.  The                                            research as proposed is important for                                           fundamental understanding of the                                                mechanisms of the nonlinearities and                                            realizing practical applications of these                                       materials.",
