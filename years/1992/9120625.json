But much remains to be               said about the detailed nature of the connections between color                 perception and color categorization, and it is not at all clear                 just which questions about cross-culture regularities in the use                of basic color terms can be usefully addressed by the methods of                visual science and psychophysics.  The problem area needs                       competent collaborative work between anthropologists and                        linguists on the one hand, and psychologists and visual                         scientists on the other.  This end will be well served by                       convening, for the first time, a cross-disciplinary working                     conference on color categorization in thought and language, and                 its biological underpinnings.  The conference will bring six or                 seven cognitive and linguistic anthropologists together with an                 equal number of psychologists and visual scientists and half a                  dozen junior investigators for three days of tutorials and                      intensive discussion of problem areas.  The proceedings of the                  conference will be transcribed, carefully edited, and published.",
