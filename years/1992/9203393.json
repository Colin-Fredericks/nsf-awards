 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Huntley will work on several problems connected with             automorphic forms.  In particular, he will study non-holomorphic                cusp forms on higher rank reductive groups.  He hopes to prove an               analogue of Weyl's law for such groups.  He will also study small               eigenvalues and their relation to the Ramanujan conjecture.                          Automorphic forms arose out of non-Euclidean geometry in the               middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians and                      physicists have thus long realized that many objects of fundamental             importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.  This field is              principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but               in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its               historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge              theory in theoretical physics and coding theory in information                  theory.",
