 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the dissertation research of a graduate                     student in cultural anthropology who will study changing gender                 relations in a pastoralist area of east Africa.  The research                   will analyze how changing local conceptions of social and                       economic class and age affect gender relations in an overall                    situation of fairly rapid and significant socio-economic                        development.  Most studies on this question have shown that                     development policies are slanted in favor of men, and result in                 decreases in the standard of living of women and children                       relative to changes for men.  This project will look at these                   relationships in more detail.  The design is to compare three                   villages varying on dimensions of development and income, using a               combination of intensive ethnography, formal surveys, and                       analysis of historical documents.  The student has lived in this                area before for several years, and has the necessary linguistic                 skills, social and political contacts to carry the research out.                                                                                                This research is important because gender relations in economic                 development schemes have become a major focus of attention in                   recent years.  This detailed case study will provide material of                value to policy makers so that new projects can be designed that                benefit women (and the children who are in their care) as well as               men.",
