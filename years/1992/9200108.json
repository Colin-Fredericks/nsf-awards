 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, supported jointly by the Analytical and                        Surface Chemistry Program and the Atmospheric Chemistry                         Program, Professor Roberts will study the interaction of small                  molecules with well-characterized ice surfaces.  These ice                      surfaces will be made by epitaxial growth on platinum single                    crystal substrates, and characterized by reflection infrared                    and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  The sticking                             probability, adsorbed structure, and surface reactivity of a                    number of small molecules relevant to stratospheric ozone                       chemistry will be examined.  Molecules such as hydrochloric                     acid, hypochlorous acid, and nitric acid will be studied, with                  a view toward understanding the effects of ice structure,                       adsorption kinetics, and surface reactions on the production of                 species important in stratospheric ozone depletion.                             %%%                                                                             Reactions occurring on stratospheric ice particles are thought                  to dominate the chemistry which results in the destruction of                   ozone in the upper atmosphere.  Very little is known about the                  basic chemistry of the ice surface, and the reactions of                        relevant small molecules on this surface.  This research                        project will address questions of adsorption and reaction of                    these small molecules, primarily chlorine source molecules, on                  well-characterized ice surfaces.  Basic information of this                     type is essential to a complete understanding and eventual                      remediation of the depletion of ozone in the upper atmosphere.",
