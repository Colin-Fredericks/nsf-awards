 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides  an Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)                      spectrometer with a 300 MHz, 7 Tesla, wide bore magnet, dedicated               to the fundamental investigation of a wide variety of solid                     materials.  NMR spectroscopy is the only tool available for the                 characterization of the molecular structures of many noncrystalline             and nanocrystalline solids. The fundamental structures of ternary               chalcopyrite compounds having potential applications as catalysts,              ceramics, and optical materials will be analyzed.  The structures               of solid state laser and nonlinear optical materials containing                 dyes, nonlinear optical polymers, and semiconductor quantum dots                prepared by sol-gel methods from siliconal koxides, from mixed                  metal alkoxides, and from mixtures of alkoxides and organic                     polymers will also be analyzed.  Additional studies of                          polymer-silica composites and polymer liquid crystals, composites               of colloidal silica crystals in noncrystalline polymers, and                    nonlinear optical polymers will be studied.  Yet another project                includes studies of modified sol-gel derived hosts as solid state               laser and nonlinear optical materials, solid state laser materials              using mixed organic/inorganic polymer hosts, and nonlinear optical              materials based on active dopants in a sol-gel derived host.  A                 study of the structures of plant cell walls is also planned.                    Knowledge of the chemical structures will aid in understanding the              properties and functions of the materials and in the design of                  synthetic materials with improved performance.  The instrument will             be shared by four faculty and several other users within the                    university, as well as a few  individuals from outside the                      university.                                                                                                                                                     The instrument will also be equipped with two 5 kHz magic angle                 spinning probes.  There are presently two liquids spectrometers and             one multinuclear NMR.  This will be the only solids NMR capability              in the State of Oklahoma.",
