 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the applicability of the classical theory of              choice under subjective uncertainty to individuals.  Two distinct               behavioral properties are implied in the classical paradigm.  The               first is the property of probabilistic sophistication, i.e., acts               are evaluated solely on the basis of their implied subjective                   probability distributions to an individual over outcomes.  The                  second property, expected utility maximization, maintains that                  these implied probability distributions over outcomes are ranked                by means of a von Neumann-Morganstern utility function and concerns             only the individual's attitudes toward risk.                                                                                                                    This research looks at individuals who are not probabilistically                sophisticated in that their choice behavior is neither derived from             nor observationally consistent with the existence of an underlying              subjective probability distribution over uncertain events.  Two                 distinct but compatible analytical approaches to this problem are               studied.  The first characterizes probabilistic sophistication in               the absence of the expected utility hypothesis.  The second                     develops the notions of a local probability distribution and local              risk preferences and examines the extent to which these concepts                can be used to characterize the global properties of non-                       probabilistically sophisticated preferences.                                                                                                                    These analytical tools will then be used to explore the general                 robustness of the concepts and results of the classical paradigm                to departures from probabilistic sophistication, and to study cases             of induced violations of probabilistic sophistication.  For                     example, group decision making with heterogeneous beliefs and                   behavior under incomplete information such as the problems of moral             hazard and adverse selection will be investigated.  This research               is very important because it tackles problems in an area central                to theoretical and practical research in economics and management               science.",
