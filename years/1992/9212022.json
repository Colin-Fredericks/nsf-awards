 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator plans several projects designed to illuminate             the dynamic features of computations and the connections between                notions of computability in varying environments.  He envisions                 separate studies on the global theory of various degree structures;             the extension of embeddings problem for the recursively enumerable              degrees; the relativized formulation of Lerman's theorem on finite              ideals in the Turing degrees; Kechris' notion of universal Borel                equivalence relations; and abstract complexity theory.                               Prominent among the questions to be addressed by this project              are a number that bear on theoretical computability.  They lie in               what is known as recursion theory, which deals with a model of                  computability knowing no bounds on time or space.  Although answers             to such questions have the ability to illuminate practical                      questions, they are really practical only when their answers are                negative, for it is a very strong statement indeed to say that                  something cannot be computed even when one puts no limits on                    resources available for the purpose.  The finer structure of                    computability theory is sometimes more relevant to actual                       computations, and various aspects of that will also be considered.",
