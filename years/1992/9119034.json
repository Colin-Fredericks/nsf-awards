 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need to understand the physicochemical environment of                  solution-filled pores in rocks has geochemical implications for                 solute transport and mass transfer between solid and solution                   phases and petrophysical implications for formation evaluation and              magnetic resonance imagining.  The proposed project will help build             that understanding through an investigation of proton nuclear                   magnetic resonance relaxation in sandstone pore-filling solutions.              The overall goal of the project is to quantify the effect of                    solution composition on relaxation rates.  Both intact rock cores               and disaggregated grain packs will be used.  The mineral surfaces               will be consistently pre-conditioned, and the materials will be                 well-characterized, with determinations of rock physical properties             (porosity, pore-size distribution, surface area: volume ratio,                  permeability, paramagnetic susceptibility, and BET surface area)                and geochemical properties (mineralogy, extractable paramagnetic                species, and cation exchange capacity).  Experimental controls on               permeability and relaxation rate include solution composition,                  surface pre-treatment, temperature, and for the grain packs, grain              size and mineralogy.  The data will be interpreted to provide three             types of quantitative information:  (1) the influence of different              surfaces on relaxation, (2) the influence of solution composition               on relaxation, and (3) relaxation mechanisms (with activation                   energies for bulk-solution and surface-induced relaxation                       processes.",
