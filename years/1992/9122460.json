 "awd_abstract_narration": "Porous materials, such as activated carbons, zedites, silicas                   and metal oxides, are widely used in industry for                               purification, separation and chemical reaction processes.  The                  choice and design of these materials is empirical of present,                   and the materials are not optimal.  Classical methods for                       interpreting gas behavior in porous solids rely on equations                    derived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and are                      inaccurate for small pores.  The aim of this projects is to                     provide more powerful methods based in molecular theory, for                    predicting adsorbed fluid behavior.  Modern statistical                         mechanical methods -- nonlocal density functional theory,                       percolation theory, kinetic theory and molecular simulation --                   will be used to make a systematic study of the role of pore                    characteristics (size, shape, interconnectedness, etc.)                         temperature, and intermolecular forces (fluid-fluid and solid-                  fluid) on the adsorption isotherm, heat of adsorption,                          solvation force, diffusion and selectivity for fluids and                       fluid mixtures in model porous materials.  Initially, Lennard-                  Jones fluids will be studied in model materials with (a)                        independent pores of simple cylindrical or slit geometry, and                   (b) nonuniform and networked pores, in which pore blocking can                  occur.  The range of independent variables, and the key                         features that yield each of the observed classes and                            subclasses of isotherm, will be determined, and the results                     will be arranged in a form that is easy to use by                               experimentalists interested in characterizing porous                            materials.  The theory will be developed as a new means for                     determining pore-size distributions.",
