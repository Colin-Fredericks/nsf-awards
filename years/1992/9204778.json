 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bradyrhizobium japonicum is the bacterial endosymbiont of soybean               (Glycine max) that functions as a nitrogen-fixing organelle within              cells of a specialized plant organ called a root nodule.  Many                  interactions occur between the two symbionts for the initiation,                development and maintenance of nodules.  The broad objective of the             proposed work is to understand how leguminous plants communicate                with their bacterial partners to regulate metabolic processes                   essential for symbiosis.  In particular, we are elucidating the                 interactive events between B. japonicum and soybean that control                heme synthesis in root nodules.  Some data support the hypothesis               that the heme prosthetic group of the plant nodule protein                      leghemoglobin is bacterial in origin, and work from my laboratory               indicates that formation of the bacterial heme moeity itself                    requires the coordinated effort of both symbionts.  Three                       objectives are proposed which address the two aforesaid hypotheses.             i) Determine whether the B. japonicum heme synthesis enzyme                     ferrochelatase is essential for soybean hemoglobin heme formation               using a temperature-sensitive mutant.  ii) Characterize the B.                  japonicum uptake mechanism of the heme precursor delta-                         aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and ascertain its role in nodule heme                synthesis.  Data indicate that bacterial uptake of plant-derived                ALA is a key feature of an inter-organismic heme pathway in                     nodules.  iii) Construct and characterize a B. japonicum mutant in              ALA dehydratase, the second step of the heme synthetic pathway, and             study the regulation of the ALA dehydratase gene.  The mutant will              allow us to determine exactly which heme synthesis steps in the                 inter-organismic pathway must be bacterial.",
