 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) catalyses the hydrolysis of aryl-                and alkaly-beta-D-glucosides, as well as cellobiose.  In maize, the             enzyme is encoded by a highly polymorphic locus, Glu1.  The main                objectives of the proposed research are to clone and characterize               the gene coding for the maize beta-glucosidase enzyme; to deduce                the amino acid sequence of the enzyme from the sequence of its                  gene; to determine in what organs and tissues this enzyme is found;             to determine where in the cell this enzyme is found, and to                     determine the natural substrates of the enzyme.  The gene will be               cloned into a multipurpose expression vector; and the desired                   recombinant clones will be indentified by immunoscreening.  The                 natural substrates will be determined by extracting beta-glucosides             with alcohol from maize tissues and testing whether the extracts                contain a substance which will competitively inhibit beta-                      glucosidase hydrolysis of commonly used artificial substrates                   (e.g., p-nitrophenol-beta-D-glucopyranoside) which are readily                  hydrolyzed by beta-glucosidase to produce glucose.  Determining in              which tissues the enzyme is found will be done by infusing tissue               sections with chromogenic beta-glucosides (e.g., X-glu and 6-bromo-             2-naphthyl beta-glucoside), which produce colored precipitates when             cleaved by beta-glucosidase.  The location of the color can then                be observed under the light microscope.  Subcellular localization               will be done using immunocytochemical techniques.                                                                                                               The results of the proposed research will further knowledge of the              structure, location, function, and regulation of plant beta-                    glucosidases; they will contribute to studies directed at finding               the molecular basis for subcellular targeting and will aid in the               development of markers which would be useful in maize breeding.",
