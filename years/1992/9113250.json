 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies several interrelated questions                    concerning neural networks, learning algorithms, and theoretical                dynamical systems.  A primary goal is to discover how certain                   features of nonlinear dynamics, and in particular the dynamic                   attractors (limit cycles, chaotic attractors, fractals)                         apparently found in biological systems, can be useful for pattern               learning, recognition, and retrieval.  To test the results, nets                that recognize handwritten digits will be built.  The normal form               projection algorithm, a new method of constructing networks, will               be used.  A key feature of a net built this way is that its                     underlying dynamics is explicitly isomorphic to any of a class of               standard, well-understood nonlinear dynamical systems.  This                    system is chosen in advance, independent of the patterns to be                  stored and the learning algorithm used.  The projection algorithm               decouples certain dynamical features -- stability, basin                        geometry, and rates of convergence -- from others that are more                 problem-dependent, such as preprocessing, learning rules, and                   reconstruction of data. Related theoretical issues in dynamical                 systems will be investigated.                                                        A neural net is a network of relatively simple computational               nodes, typically summing or damping devices whose output depends                nonlinearly on their inputs.  The connections between nodes may                 themselves be weighted so that certain inputs or outputs are more               influential than others.  If one views a net as a dynamical                     system, the rest points of the system are what the net \"knows.\"                 The theoretical knowledge and practical experience gained in this               project may lead to greater understanding of the design                         principles that underlie the superior performance of biological                 systems in pattern recognition, robotics, and adaptive behavior,                and to greater insight into memory, learning, and motor control                 in biological networks.  Practical consequences arise in the                    applications of these ideas to problems in pattern recognition,                 signal processing, process control, and general interfaces                      between people and machines.",
