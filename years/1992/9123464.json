 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in                  communications and network security between Yvo Desmedt of the                  University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee and Michael Burmmester and                   Frederick Piper of the University of London.  The project is                    concerned with the possibility of communicating unintended secret               messages in multi-sender and multi-receiver networks.  The                      objective is to design secure communications and network systems                to protect against abuses in cryptographic protocols.  Dr. Desmedt              brings to this collaboration his background in theoretical computer             science and his understanding of practical issues in communication              network systems.  His recent research, in cooperation with the                  British investigators, has shown that a geometric approach to these             problems could be useful for developing abuse-free cryptosystems                and subliminal free authentication communication channels.  British             expertise in finite geometry and applications to multi-user network             security complements Dr. Desmedt's background.                                                                                                                  Multi-user network security is likely to grow in importance with                the development of large voice and data networks and their                      worldwide availability.  Information security and protection of                 privacy are important issues in this area.  This project offers an              innovative geometric approach and possible solutions to these                   problems.",
