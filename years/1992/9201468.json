 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with problems in commutative                    algebra, algebraic geometry and computational issues in those                   fields.  In commutative algebra, the principal investigator will                study linear resolutions and Huneke's question on the structure                 of free resolutions.  In algebraic geometry, he will consider a                 generalized Castelnuovo conjecture, the family of compactified                  Jacobians by projective stability, degeneracy of secant and                     tangent varieties by methods from differential geometry, as well                as ribbons, K3 carpets and supermanifolds.  The computational                   parts of this project are concerned with criteria for systems of                parameters and development of the computer algebra system,                      Macaulay.                                                                            This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                    origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field                makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields,                as well as, in theoretical computer science and robotics.",
