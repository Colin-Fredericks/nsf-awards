The basic goal is to                    produce two volumes, one a coleection of texts in the language,                 the other an analytic dictionary.  Lawrence Morgan recently                     completed a dissertation that provides a grammatical description                of the language.  The two volumes proposed, together with                       Morgan's dissertation, will provide a well-rounded description of               the language.  The dissertation is primarily descriptive and                    makes the facts of Kutenai grammar available to linguists of all                theoretical persuasions.                                                                                                                                        The project will involve transcribing a number of the texts that                already exist on tape, entering them onto computer, and analyzing               them.  There are also some existing texts that have only been                   transcribed, and others that have been transcribed and entered                  onto computer but which need to be analyzed.  The dictionary will               serve as a glossary for the volume of texts and for the                         dissertation.  Field work will be undertaken and the project will               interface with local community-based language projects.",
