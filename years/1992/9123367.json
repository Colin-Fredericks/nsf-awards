The focus of the conference will be on all types                   of cosmic ray showers observed in a large variety of different                  detectors, including photographic emulsions and other                           electronic particle detector devices.  Fundamental questions                    regarding both astrophysics and particle physics are addressed                  by data which are likely to be presented.  In astrophysics,                     the sources and the genders of cosmic rays as well as the                       acceleration mechanisms resulting in their high energies are                    of profound interest.  In particle physics, the nature of the                   high energy interactions with the atmosphere are important,                     and can be related to data from the world's highest energy                      accelerator - the Tevatron collider at Fermilab - from which                    data should also be presented at the conference.  The                           conference is seventh in a bi-annual series, and is sponsored                   by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics                          (IUPAP).",
