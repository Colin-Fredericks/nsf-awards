 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interplay between the chemical environment and the dynamics of              species is of fundamental importance to ecosystems.  Recruitment,               predation, and biotic disturbance, for example, are commonly                    mediated by specific biogenic chemicals whose alteration can                    profoundly affect the dynamics of the community.  This project will             study the coupling between the presence of biogenic brominated                  aromatics and the dynamics of members of three trophic levels in a              marine sedimentary assemblage.  The project utilized the production             of bromoaromatics by a worm and its contamination of the                        surrounding habitat as a model system for examining the following               questions: 1. How does the presence of these compounds affect rates             of predation and disturbance? and 2. How important are bacteria in              controlling the level of sediment contamination?  Based on the PI's             prior research it is known that recruitment of some species is                  radically reduced in the presence of these bromoaromatics. However,             there is a lack of information on the effects of these compounds on             the major disturbance forces in the system, sediment-biting and                 digging predators, and on the processes that maintain the level of              these toxic brominated phenols in the sediment.  Using a variety of             laboratory and field experiments, this research project will                    investigate the effects of the biogenic bromoaromatics on these                 processes.  Given the global abundance in marine sedimentary                    habitats of taxa producing brominated aromatics, these compounds                may be very important as structuring forces in marine sedimentary               communities.",
