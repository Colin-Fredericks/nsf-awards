 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program focuses on the fundamentals of                            electrostatic spraying and some novel applications of this                      technology in the areas of multiphase combustion and targeted                   aerosol drug therapy.  The objective of the first application                   is the study of the formation and burning of electrosprays of                   liquid fuels at both normal and reduced gravity in laminar and                  turbulent flow regimes.  The underlying philosophical approach                  is that of providing an experimental arrangement that will                      allow a systematic study of spray evolution and burning in                      configurations of successively increasing levels of                             complexity, starting from laminar sprays to fully turbulent                     ones.  A counterflow diffusion flame burner has been designed                   and used to stabilize a self-sustained ES flame of haptene.                     This configuration allows the decoupling of droplet-droplet                     and droplet-gas interactions from turbulence complications and                  represents a well-defined two-phase combustion flow whose                       ambient field can be systematically varied.  The ultimate goal                  of this experimental approach is that of eventually burning in                  a regime of three-dimensional droplet-droplet interaction, for                  which no experimental results are currently available.  The                     next level of complexity involves the \"injection\" of                            turbulence into the gas stream with synthesis of various                        turbulence scenarios characterized by different intensities                     and scales.  These experiments will address the issue of                        droplets/turbulence interaction which manifests itself as a                     two-way coupling.  As part of this activity, experiments will                   be conducted in a drop-tower facility to delineate the effects                  of natural convection on combustion of electrosprays.                                                                                                           A second electrospray application lies in the area of aerosol                   drug therapy, whereby acute and chronic respiratory diseases                    are treated by administration of a variety of substances as                     airborne dispersions of small \"particles\", typically composed                   of pure liquids or liquid mixtures such as water or aqueous                     saline solutions, in which drugs are either dissolved or                        suspended.  An electrostatic spray appears to be an excellent                   candidate for this task, since under appropriate experimental                   conditions it is capable of generating monodisperse droplets                    of arbitrary size and can be used to aerosolize pure liquids                    or suspensions of macromolecules (thus lending itself to                        dispersion of liposome encapsulated agents).  Aqueous saline                    solutions and suspensions of liposomes in a liquid carrier                      will be electrosprayed to generate droplets of controlled size                  and size distribution in the 1-8 micron range for targeted                      pulmonary deposition.  Effects of liquid flow rate, physical                    properties, and electric field on the generated droplets will                   be studied.  The influence of a delivery line in the path from                  generation to inhalation on the aerosol size distribution and                   transmission will also be investigated.",
