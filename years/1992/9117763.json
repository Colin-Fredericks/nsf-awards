 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins which bind to specific base sequences in DNA regulate                  the expression of many different genes.  Transcription factor                   TFIIIA, the prototype of the Zn-finger class of proteins, binds                 strongly to a defined base sequence contained within the coding                 region of 5S RNA genes.  This interaction represents the                        primary step in assembly of a transcriptionally active complex                  and, once assembled, these complexes persist through many                       rounds of transcription.  The objective of this research is an                  understanding of the molecular interactions between this                        protein and its target sequence during complex formation and                    transcription. To facilitate these studies, a photosensitive                    cross-linking reagent has been developed, 5-N3-deoxyuridine-5'-                 triphosphate, which can be enzymatically incorporated into DNA                  in place of thymidine.  Photoactive DNA can be used to label                    sites or regions in proteins which are in close proximity to                    the DNA,  Contacts between purified TFIIIA and specific                         positions in the Xenopus.  5S, DNA internal control region have                 been mapped.  This allows examination of the fine structure of                  this interaction to understand the recognition process,                         determine how it is affected by the presence of other                           transcription factors as well as RNA polymerase III, and look                   for changes which occur as the polymerase initiates RNA                         synthesis and traverses the TFIIIA contact sites.",
