 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most exciting breakthroughs of the 1980's in stellar                 physics is the study of nonradial pulsations to the study of                    the interiors of white dwarf stars.  Much of the previous success               of previous efforts has been because of the ability of astronomers              to match observed periods in white dwarf variable stars to periods              computed from theoretical models determined by the Principal                    Investigator (PI).  In this three year program the PI will extend               his previous work to evolutionary models of stars and will enable               the effects of changes in the star's structure from its evolution               to be predicted for timescales considerably shorter than a human                lifetime (e.g. a decade).  This work will also permit the effects               of important but hithero only crudely treated processes, such as                chemical separation, to be included in these calculations.                      This work will have application not only to the study of white                  dwarf evolution but to the studies of \"asteroseismology\" of other               stars as well, possibly including the Sun.",
