 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is               in the general area of chemical synthesis in the subfield of                    ferroelectricity.  The long range scientific goals of this                      research are to increase understanding of the correlation of                    molecular structure with physical properties of tilted liquid                   crystal phases, and to test strategies for design of new                        materials.  Specifically, the work is aimed at inventing new low                viscosity and low birefringence smectic C Hosts for use with high               polarization ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) dopants.  Such low              viscosity smectic C hosts, in combination with the proper chiral                FLC dopants, would have application in flat panel displays and                  spatial light modulators (SLMs) requiring the fastest rise times.               Ferroelectric (chiral) smectic C* liquid crystals have been shown               to exhibit high speed, multistate electro-optic and display device              applications, particularly when incorporated into the surface                   stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) light valve.  Flat              panel displays based upon the SSFLC device concept have many                    potential advantages.  However, due to the high birefringence and               relatively slow speed of existing materials, SSFLC light valves                 prove problematical in some important applications.  Both of these              problems--high birefringence and slow switching speed--are                      addressed by the creation of a new class of perfluorinated FLC                  hosts.",
