 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project is in the               general area of chemical synthesis in the subfield of chemical                  catalysis.  Ethylene glycol is an important commodity chemical                  with a world market valued at over $3 billion per year.  Ethylene               glycol is currently synthesized by the epoxidation of ethylene to               ethylene oxide followed by hydration.  For a process of such large              scale, there are significant incentives to developing a more                    economical synthesis based on cheaper raw materials and a less                  capital intensive process.                                                                                                                                      In this Phase I proposal a route for the synthesis of ethylene                  glycol based on ethane is outlined.  This work elaborates on                    active research at Catalytica aimed at the discovery of novel                   systems that allow the conversion of methane to methanol with high              selectivity via two consecutive selective oxidations of each                    methyl group, to the formation of ethylene glycol.  The phase I                 research objectives are to study factors that influence the                     regiospecificity in the consecutive oxidation reactions from                    ethane to ethylene glycol.",
