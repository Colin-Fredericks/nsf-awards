 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thermal hysteresis producing antifreeze proteins lower the freezing             point, but not the melting point, of water by a special mechanism               which makes them extremely effective antifreezes. These antifreeze              proteins (AFPs) have been reported in many cold blooded animals                 (polar marine fishes, insects, spiders, centipedes), but they have              been best studied in fish where the biochemistry of the AFPs are                well understood and certain of the AFP genes have cloned and                    transferred to other organisms (salmon, plants, bacteria).                      The AFPs from the overwintering larvae of the beetle Dendroides                 canadensis are by far the most active AFPs known. The studies                   outlined in this proposal will allow us to continue our work on                 these interesting AFPs. Biochemical characterization of the AFP                 will continue and in addition we will clone the Dendroides AFP                  gene. The gene will be sequenced, providing the amino acid sequence             of the protein and allowing comparisons to the fish AFPs. Also, the             function of the AFPs in the membranes of epidermal cells located                just under the cuticle of the larvae will be investigated. These                studies will further our understanding of the role of AFPs in                   insect cold tolerance. Because of the high activity of this AFP the             results could have applications in cryopreservation, agriculture                and frozen food technology.",
