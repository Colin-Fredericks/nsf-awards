 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this US-Poland research project between                        Dr. Jurg X. Saladin of the University of Pittsburgh and                         Drs. W. Nazarewicz, S. Cwick, and Z. Szymanski of the                           University of Warsaw is to study nuclei under conditions                        of extreme rotational velocities.  In the mass 70 to 80                         region, the studies will focus on properties of rotational                      bands which are characterized by rapid changes as a                             function of the number of protons and neutrons and as a                         function of angular frequency.  The researchers will                            determine quantities of the moments of inertia,                                 electromagnetic transition rates, spin alignment,                               signature splitting and signature inversion.  They will                         interpret the results of these measurements by means of                         cranked shell model calculations, which include Strutinsky                      averaging and take into account the effects of the pairing                      interaction.  They will search for electric molecule                            transitions in the mass 80 region using an array of mini-                       orange electron spectrometers.  Monopole transitions                            depend on the mixing of bands with different shapes and on                      the changes in the rms radius.  The researchers will study                      the decay of superdeformed bands in the rare earth region                       into bands of normal deformation using the same                                 measurements.  They will also study the octupole effects                        in the actinide region.                                                                                                                                         This project in theoretical nuclear physics fulfills the                        program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                          enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern                       Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources                      in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
