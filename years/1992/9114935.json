 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supernovae are important in astronomy both because they are a                   key phase in the evolution of stars and because they produce                    energy and enriched chemical elements to the interstellar                       gas from which new generations of stars form.  To understand                    the physical mechanism involved requires a knowledge of how                     supernova evolve after they fade from the initial brilliance of                 their explosions to faint knots and filaments of their remnants at              large distances from their origins.  The Principal Investigator                 (PI) will continue a spectroscopic survey to discovery of supernova             remnants primarily in the Magellanic Clouds and the external galaxy             M33 to find new remnants.  He will also take \"photographs\" of known             remnants with a charged coupled device (CCD) detector combined with             filters appropriate to emission lines of ions that permit an                    analysis of the remnant's chemical abundances, motions, and thermal             characteristics.  The PI has taken a lead in the past in involving              undergraduates in the studies of these kinematic images.  This                  proposal is expected to provide a dual purpose, both in elucidating             the evolution of supernovae centuries after their explosions and                in the instruction of students in the techniques of extracting                  information from multiple exposure images.",
