 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Center, in association with the University of Illinois, Purdue             University, the University of Michigan, and the National Institute              of Standards and Technology, undertakes multidisciplinary                       interactive research, as well as broadly based education, outreach,             and knowledge transfer activities. The research focuses on                      developing a fundamental understanding of cement-based materials                and the complex relationships among cement chemistry,                           microstructure, processing, micromechanics and engineering                      properties, and exploiting knowledge gained to design high                      performance cement-based materials with superior properties for use             in advanced materials structures and systems. These goals require               an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional and well coordinated                  research team, with expertise in cement chemistry, fracture                     mechanics, surface science, electrical engineering, computer                    simulation and modeling, and materials science and engineering. The             educational and outreach activities include a pre-college                       enrichment program for high school science and math teachers, a                 five week summer program for high school students, and summer                   research experience for undergraduates. Knowledge transfer is                   effected through research symposia, international research                      personnel exchange and research collaboration, the Industrial                   Affiliates Program, active participation in the Illinois Technology             Challenge Program, and publications in appropriate technical                    journals. This Center is directed by Professor Surendra P. Shah.",
