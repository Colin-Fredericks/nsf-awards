 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project has three parts.  The first involves                 some ideas about the homotopy type of diffeomorphisms of                        manifolds beyond the stable range, in which these are related to                algebraic K-theory.  The second is a program for understanding                  the K-theory of group rings in terms of cyclic subgroups.  The                  third is concerned with applications of the cyclotomic trace to                 K(Z) and to A(S1).                                                                   The details of these three parts vary, but all are concerned               either with reducing geometric information to a subject                         for calculation or to perfecting one of the principal algebraic                 tools used for this purpose.  The nature of the geometric                       information involved is the crux of the difficulty.  While                      questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth                   virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is far                      different with what are known as topological properties of                      geometric objects.  These are properties such as connectedness                  (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so                  forth.  All systematic study of such properties, for example, how               to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to               one of these properties or are only superficially different, or                 how to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all                  these have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they                  have been reduced to matters of calculation.  Algebraic K-theory                has been developed into a major tool for this purpose, and the                  interplay between the algebra and the topology involved remains a               fascinating subject.",
