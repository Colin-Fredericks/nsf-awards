 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Dan Healan, MS Elizabeth Mozzillo will               collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will analyze a                  range of archaeological materials which she has collected from the              prehistoric site of Cerro de las Ventantas (CV) which is located in             northern Mexico. The entire mesa top of CV is covered by what                   probably were civic-ceremonial buildings including impressive                   platform constructions, a number of plazas, two small pyramids and              a circular structure. The sole prehistoric access trail to the                  mesatop is lined with the remains of a stone stairway which passes              near a rockshelter filled with the cliff dwellings from which the               promontory and archaeological zone take their names. To date MS                 Mozzillo and her colleagues have surveyed and mapped the region.                They have collected surface materials and conducted controlled                  stratigraphic excavations. The goal of the current project is to                analyze the materials collected. Together with assistants MS                    Mozzillo will construct a ceramic tyopology which will allow sites              to be placed relative to each other in time. Radiocarbon                        determinations will be used to anchor the sequence with absolute                dates. Other classes of materials recovered - these include lithic              faunal and human skeletal remains - will also be examined.                                                                                                      While this region of northern Mexico contains many archaeological               sites, it has received little archaeological scrutiny. The reason               for this is its intermediate position between the \"great\" sites and             cultures of the Valley of Mexico to the South and the impressive                remains located in the U.S. Southwest to the North. The region                  appears to have served as a \"frontier zone.\" Archaeologists have                speculated for many years about the rise of complex prehistoric                 societies in the U.S. Southwest. Some believe that this process                 took place essentially independently of developments in central                 Mexico while others see strong linkages. To solve this question it              is necessary to study sites which lie between these two areas and               MS. Mozzillo's work will contribute to this goal.                                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our                   understanding of U.S. prehistory and shed light on the rise of                  complex societies. It will also assist in the training of an                    extremely promising scientist.",
