 "awd_abstract_narration": "Words with more than one meaningful part can be described in two                ways: as independent lexical items or as the result of a rule                   that combines two morphemes into a single word.  Recent                         approaches without morphological rules describe morphological                   patterns as phonological generalizations over a set of forms.                   Such proposals have two consequences:  (1) regularly inflected                  forms may be stored in the lexicon, and (2) phonological factors                should influence morphological processing.                                                                                                                      The aim of the research project is to examine these consequences                using experiments-induced speech errors in three tasks:  SLIPS                  (for phonological errors), morphonaming (for morphological errors               where an inflected form is the target), and embedding (for                      morphological errors where the base form is the target).  The                   results may demonstrate that non-rule-based approaches are                      unworkable, if they show that regular forms are not stored in the               lexicon or that phonological factors cannot underlie                            morphological effects.  However, if the results show that regular               forms are stored and that phonological factors could underlie                   morphological effects, then non-rule-based approaches will still                be workable.",
