 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Robert Benfer, Professor of                          Anthropology at the University of Missouri, Mr. Michael Elam will               collect data for his doctoral dissertation. During the course of                fieldwork in 1991 Mr. Elam collected obsidian (volcanic glass)                  samples from the archaeological site of Monte Alban, located in                 the Valley of Oaxaca in central Mexico as well as from other                    sites in the region.  These cover the Terminal Formative, Classic               and Postclassic periods and date from ca. AD 1 - 1520. These                    materials, which have been returned to the U.S. with Mexican                    government approval, will be subjected to two kinds of analysis.                A subseries will be dated by means of obsidian hydration.                       Secondly, concentrations of 28 elements will be determined                      through neutron activation analysis and through comparison with                 samples from known geological deposits the origin of the                        archaeological specimens can be pinpointed.  With these data, Mr.               Elam will be able to determine how exchange in obsidian materials               changed over time and the role which Monte Alban played in this                 process.                                                                                                                                                        Obsidian has provided a focus for many archaeological studies in                Middle America.  Prehistorically, it was a rare and extremely                   valuable material both because it was easy to flake into tools                  and because it produced razor sharp cutting edges.  Since                       obsidian results from volcanic eruption, it is found only in                    discrete highly localized areas.  Because chemical composition                  differs from region to region, it is possible to analyze                        archaeological specimens and match them to a specific source.                   Thus, it is possible to determine how obsidian moved through                    prehistoric social systems and gain insight into both their                     economic and political organization. Monte Alban exhibits the                   characteristics of many other Middle American centers.  It rose,                achieved a regional dominance as the center of a small state, and               then declined.  The processes which underlie this transformation                however are not well understood and this research will help to                  elucidate them.                                                                                                                                                 This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data of interest to a large number of archaeologists.  It will                  shed new light on the role which trade played in the emergence of               social complexity and will assist in the training of a promising                young scientist.",
