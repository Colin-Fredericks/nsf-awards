 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a long-term visit by Professor                          Burtrand I. Lee, Department of Ceramic Engineering, Clemson                     University, to Japan for a twelve month cooperative research                    project with Dr. Ken Takahashi, Department of Ceramics, Hitachi                 Research Laboratory in Hitachi City, Japan.  The researchers plan               to undertake a study of low dielectric constant cordierite                      electronic substrates via porosity controlled sol-gel process.                  Porosity controlled cordiertie substrates will be produced by                   direct casting of hydrolyzed metal-organic precursors of MgO, Al2               O-3, and SiO -2 followed by gelation, drying, and heat                          treatments.  The aging and drying procedures will be developed to               hasten the process.  The substrates will be characterized for                   microstructure, phases, porosity, film thickness, dielectric                    constants, and sintering behavior as a function of porosity.                                                                                                    The research results have the potential of contributing                         significantly to the fundamental understanding of sol-gel                       processing and may produce materials suitable for engineering                   end-use evaluations in electronic circuits.  It may also lead to                the expansion of ceramic materials in electronic packaging                      applications.  The Hitachi Research Laboratory is a highly                      recognized and prestigeous facility with state of the art                       equipment. It is a world leader in many aspects of ceramic                      electronic packaging.  This collaboration, therefore, should                    contribute to furthering ceramic electronic technology in the                   United States.  It is anticipated that the collaboration between                the researchers will continue beyond the termination of this                    formal agreement.",
