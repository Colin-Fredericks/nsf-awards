 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marine Physical Laboratory at Scripps Institution of                        Oceanography will upgrade a suite of general purpose oceanographic              instruments that are used in long-term deployments on the sea                   floor.  These versatile electronic instruments are used to record               seafloor seismic and other signals for intervals of many months at              high data rates.  They were designed for low power consumption and              adaptability in order that a variety of oceanographic sensors could             be accommodated.  The upgrades will allow for six-month or longer               duration deployments with seismic, geodetic, electromagnetic, or                other sensors.  The recording medium will be increased to at least              1.2 Gbytes using one of more data recorders.  A data compression                scheme will be developed and ten instruments will receive new,                  precision timing devices.  Low power, temperature controlled quartz             oscillators will be installed in these instruments.  Once upgraded,             this suite of instruments will be capable of long-term deployments              required of experiments such as those proposed in the Global Change             RIDGE program and other individual research projects.",
