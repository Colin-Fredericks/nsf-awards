 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                  of Professor Stuart W. Staley at Carnegie Mellon University.                    Dynamic processes in bicyclooctatetraenyl dianions will be                      examined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  The                       activation barriers for bond shifting and charge transfer will                  be determined by complete line shape analysis, saturation                       transfer, or by other NMR methods.  The difference between                      these values will be equated to \"pure\" charge transfer in the                   absence of any major conformational change.  These charge                       transfer rates are related to electronic coupling under                         conditions of solvent-separated ion pairing and cation transfer                 under conditions of contact ion pairing.  The rates will be                     measured as functions of the identities of the bridging group,                  cation, and solvent.                                                            %%%                                                                             Electron transfer from ring to ring in compounds containing two                 rings separated by spacer groups will be examined.  These                       studies will be conducted under conditions in which a                           positively charged species (a cation) is and is not tightly                     associated with the electron-rich ring.  The rate at which the                  electrons transfer as a function of spacer group connecting the                 two rings will provide valuable information on the ability of                   the spacer to act as a conduit for electron transfer.  The                      effect of solvent on the electron transfer will also be                         examined.",
