 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in human memory has shown that one's memory for an event               is a structured collection of different kinds of information.                   For example, if we meet someone at a cocktail party, we might                   store visual information regarding the person's appearance,                     phonemic and verbal information representing the person's name                  and its spelling, semantic information and impressions, plus                    various kinds of background context.  This research will                        investigate the roles of different kinds of information in recall               and recognition.  The research focuses on the distinction between               item-specific and associative information, a distinction which                  has a long history in psychology, and is a cornerstone of current               mathematical models of memory.                                                                                                                                  In 10 experiments (plus several variations), people will study                  lists of words; the kinds of materials and the encoding                         conditions will vary across experiments.  Following list                        presentation, these individuals will be tested using free and                   cued recall and item and associative recognition testing                        procedures.  These testing procedures vary in the kinds of                      information and the kinds of retrieval processes which are                      necessary for adequate performance.  For example, recall and                    associative recognition depend primarily on associations formed                 between words, whereas item recognition does not.  An important                 question in this research regards the role of nonnecessary                      information.  For example, associative information need not be                  retrieved in making recognition decisions about individual words.               What role does the associative information play?                                                                                                                Regarding retrieval processes, recall tasks require the recovery                and production of retrieved information, whereas recognition                    testing does not.  Comparisons among these test procedures and                  how they are sensitive to manipulations in materials and study                  conditions will provide important information concerning the                    representation and retrieval of information from memory.                        Moreover, the results of these experiments will be important in                 testing and developing current mathematical models of memory.",
