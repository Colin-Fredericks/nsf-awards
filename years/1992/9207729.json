Equivariant K-theory and                 the K-theory of crossed product algebras have played an important               role in the solution of geometric and topological problems                      associated with group actions and with fundamental groups of                    manifolds.  Examples of such problems include many cases of the                 Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture on the existence of metrics                  with positive scalar curvature and many cases of the Novikov                    conjecture on the homotopy invariance of higher signatures.                     Kasparov's representation ring KK(G)(C,C) and its distinguished                 idempotent have played a fundamental role in this program.  This                research will apply the Kasparov representation theory with the                 intention for contributing to the geometric understanding of the                K-theory of crossed product C(*)-algebras.                                           This work in 'modern analysis' blends sophisticated research               in algebra, geometry, and analysis to examine the underlying                    theory of manifolds or surfaces.  This analysis is by way of the                action of the transformation groups of a space on a surface or                  geometric object in that space.",
