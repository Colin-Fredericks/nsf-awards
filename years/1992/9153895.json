 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth Game is a five-day simulation, modeled on the war games                   the military have staged for a hundred years.  An international                 group of scientists, diplomats and political experts will react                 to a simulated environmental crisis caused by global climate                    change.  The period of play is 1995 to 2010.  The proceedings                   will be videotaped and edited into four hours of television                     programming for international broadcast to a general audience in                the spring of 1992.  Earth Game is a project of WQED with the                   Smithsonian Institution, the British Broadcasting Corporation,                  Adrian Malone Productions, and the U.S. Naval War College.  The                 objectives are: 1.) to stimulate greater public and governmental                interest in the subject of climate change; 2.) to foster greater                understanding of what we do and don't know about the causes of                  climate change, and 3.) to develop a greater appreciation of the                dilemmas posed by the need for political action in the fact of                  the threats and uncertainties surrounding climate change.                       Senior Smithsonian scientists, Naval War College game design                    experts, the distinguished television producer Adrian Malone,                   and a small group of advisers are planning the event, which is                  scheduled to take place in Newport, Rhode Island in November                    1991 at the historic facilities of the Naval War College.",
