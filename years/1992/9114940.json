 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most reliable signatures of the youngest observable                  stars is the emission of their infrared CO spectral lines from a                wind or a pair of collimated bipolar jets.  The source of this                  energetic outflow is still unknown, but there are reasons to                    believe that the energy for this particle ejection comes from                   the infall of matter from a circumstellar accretion disk. The                   matter is then deflected by a combination of magnetic and stellar               rotation forces and ejected in a collimated flow.  The object                   of this proposal is to study the emission profiles of CO, hydrogen,             oxygen, and lines of other elements in order to test the                        correctness \"x-celerator\" model. The Principal Investigator and                 his Co-Investigator have just constructed a high dispersion                     infrared spectrograph that they will use for this program at                    the infrared telescopes on Mauna Kea Observatory, Hawaii. They                  will use their data to constrain the kinematical models for                     observed flows and work closely with the originator of the                      x-celerator model, Dr. Frank Shu of U. Calif. Berkeley. The                     results of this investigation are expected to have application                  not only to young stars but to other sites where bipolar jets                   have been observed, such as the nuclei of \"active\" galaxies.",
