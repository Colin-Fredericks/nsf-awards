 "awd_abstract_narration": "This equipment grant will be used to purchase a                                 multidimensional gas chromatography system to support                           combustion research activities at Drexel University.  The                       complex analytical problems of separating the intermediates                     and products from the oxidation of fuel-like hydrocarbons                       require sophisticated chromatographic techniques.  Two                          complementary methodologies to provide these capabilities are                   capillary columns and computer-controlled programmed valve                      switching, also called multi-dimensional or \"heart cutting\"                     analysis. While capillary columns by themselves provide                         increased resolution, they have not been sufficient to                          separate very complicated mixtures of alkanes, olefins, and                     oxygenates.  To achieve separation, it is often necessary to                    use multiple columns which are switched into and out of the                     carrier gas during an analysis.  Further separation is often                    achieved by holding selected fractions of the gas sample in a                   column and backflushing this partial sample into a second                       analytical column.  This technique is called multidimensional                   gas chromatography and has been successfully applied to                         hydrocarbon oxidation studies.  The system to be purchased                      will permit implementation of these sophisticated separation                    techniques.  To allow analysis of permanent gases, the system                   will be configured to allow dual detector operation using both                  flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors.                                                                                                            It is necessary to have a basic understanding of the oxidation                  and ignition characteristics of pure single component fuels                     and simple mixtures of these fuels before understanding of the                  oxidation and ignition characteristics of full-boiling range                    fuels can be developed.  This requires development of detailed                  kinetic mechanisms and verification using analysis techniques                   to assess the reaction intermediates and products formed                        during the combustion process.  The number of such species                      formed progressively increases with increasing molecular                        weight of the fuel.  Thus, determination of the large number                    of compounds involved using conventional gas chromatography                     becomes extremely difficult and tedious.  Use of                                multidimensional gas separation techniques greatly facilitates                  species identification for multicomponent samples and thus                      allows for basic research into the oxidation chemistry of                       realistic hydrocarbons of higher molecular weight.",
