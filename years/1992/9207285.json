 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the representations of                     semisimple groups over finite fields and quantum groups.  The                   principal investigator will study characters of finite                          dimensional irreducible representations of quantum groups at                    roots of 1.  He will also study character sheaves and their                     relation with the irreducible characters of finite groups of Lie                type.  Finally, he will study canonical bases of enveloping                     algebras.  One of the postdoctoral associates will work on Lang's               conjecture in positive characteristic and Chow groups of some                   moduli spaces of curves.  Another postdoctoral associate will                   work on a proof of the Lefschetz Trace Formula for algebraic                    stacks and the conjecture of Weil on Tamagawa Numbers over                      function fields.  Another postdoctoral associate will study both                the applications of analytic tools to the understanding of                      quantum groups and the use of quantum groups to approach                        questions of analytic interest.                                                      Quantum groups are a new area of research for both                         mathematicians and physicists.  On the mathematical side, it                    combines three of the oldest areas of \"pure\" mathematics,                       algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it is of great interest to                  physicists working on conformal quantum field theory.",
