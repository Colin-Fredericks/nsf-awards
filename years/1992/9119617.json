 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to investigate two main areas of solar research.               The first is an improvement in our current knowledge of the                     thermodynamic structure and dynamical motions of the solar                      interior through the application of the tools of helioseismology.               This goal will be reached through the continuation of an on-                    going, dedicated observing program which is located at the 60-                  Foot Solar Tower Telescope of the mount Wilson Observatory and                  through the continued analysis of the observations of solar                     oscillations which have already been obtained by that program.                  The second goal is the establishment of a two-station ground-                   based network for the observation of high-degree solar                          oscillations through the installation of an additional dedicated                observing system, which will be located at the Crimean                          Astrophysical Observatory in the USSR.  Through the installation                and operation of this second station the PI will foster a strong                collaboration between U.S. and Soviet helioseismologists and                    enhance the scientific return of our future U.S. observations                   beyond the return which we would get from the Mt. Wilson                        observations alone.  The observations of the sun's surface                      motions will be converted into measurements of the frequencies,                 rotationally and magnetically induced frequency splittings,                     amplitudes and lifetimes of global solar oscillation modes.                     These results  will then be inverted to map the sun's internal                  sound speed and angular velocity as functions of radius and                     latitude.",
