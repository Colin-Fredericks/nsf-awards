 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective risk management often requires effective risk                         communication.  Risk communicators cannot afford to assume that                 those who receive their communication do so with a tabula rasa.                 Readers use their prior knowledge to organize and understand new                information. Both the contents and organization of readers' prior               knowledge affect how they interpret new information.  Therefore                 risk communication should be more effective if it (1) addresses                 prior misconceptions, and (2) takes into account the readers'                   goals, prior knowledge, and cognitive limitations in processing new             information.  In the context of risk communication, these                       propositions have not been adequately evaluated.  This project                  attempts to fill this gap.                                                      The first study examines several designs for dispelling                         misconceptions about global climate change and 60 Hertz electric                and magnetic fields.  The second study examines the influence of                text structure and text comprehension aids on risk communication                effectiveness.  The third study integrates the results of the first             two into two complete risk communications that differ structurally.             Multiple measures are proposed to evaluate risk communication                   effectiveness in all studies, including performance on recall,                  recognition, and problem-solving tasks.                                         The project will produce empirically tested documents and                       evaluation instruments as well as practical guidelines for risk                 communicators.  Contributions to risk perception, risk                          communication and risk communication evaluation research are                    anticipated.",
