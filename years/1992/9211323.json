 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to build a high-level synthesis               system which maps behavioral descriptions into register-transfer                level designs with guaranteed performance.  The approach is to                  examine subtasks of the high-level synthesis problem using                      theoretical tools necessary to understand the synthesis problem.                Synthesis subtasks in the areas of scheduling and datapath                      allocation are being examined.  Scheduling problems being                       investigated include: finding good heuristics to bound the search               space so that good quality schedules for large size designs can be              found in a timely way; use an integer programming formulation to                solve the module selection problem; and develop a powerful, integer             programming based, algorithm to optimally group functions into                  hardware modules.  Register allocation problems include: devising               a register allocation algorithm which will minimize both the number             of registers and register transfers in the presence of loops and                conditionals while accounting for interconnect cost; formulate the              module allocation problem along the same lines as the register                  allocation; and investigate a good ordering of the allocation                   subtasks so that interconnects play a major role in the design                  process.",
