Scouten                                 of Baylor University and Drs. Jaroslava Turkova                                 and Milan Benes of institutes in the Czechoslovak                               Academy of Sciences is to investigate the                                       immobilization of various proteins in a sight-                                  directed and/or oriented fashion.  The approaches                               taken by the American and Czechoslovak                                          researchers, while distinct, are complementary.                                 The American researchers have been attempting to                                create a broad and general type of orientation                                  using chemical features of the matrix, the                                      activating agent, and of the enzyme itself.  The                                Czechoslovak researchers have been using                                        biological interactions between an immobilized                                  protein, or other biomolecule, and the protein to                               be immobilized.  Results are expected to                                        facilitate the exchange of technical methods                                    between the groups.                                                                                                                                             This project in biochemistry fulfills the program                               objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                                  enabling leading experts in the United States and                               Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents                                 and pool resources in areas of strong mutual                                    interest and competence.",
