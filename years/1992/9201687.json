 "awd_abstract_narration": "With their involvement in intelligent structures, and aerospace                 and nuclear applications, civil engineers must also be concerned                about the reliability of the software they develop to control,                  sense, and monitor.  Consider for example the high dependability                and fault tolerance required of software for active structural                  control.  Because these real-time systems operate without a human               in the loop, the impact of errors can be particularly                           devastating: control system failure could excite the structure                  rather than dissipate vibration.  The overall goals of this                     research are to examine the impact of reliability issues in real-               time, civil engineering software, and to define a practical                     methodology, consisting of both predeployment validation and run-               time support, that can be used to ensure reliability.  More                     specifically, the study will focus on software reliability of                   active structural control, and will draw on notions such as                     static verification and real-time testing techniques to ensure                  software correctness, as well as fault tolerance and redundancy                 to provide dependable behavior in the presence of hardware and                  software errors.  The benefits of this study are expected to                    enable the development of reliable, fault-tolerant, real-time                   computer software for practical civil engineering applications.",
