 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formal knowledge theory for a single person has been extensively                developed starting some thirty years ago.  During the last ten to               fifteen years it has become increasingly clear that these issues                are of great importance to the interactive social sciences and in               related areas; and that when there is more than one person, new                 problems arise which require treatment going beyond the one-                    person treatment.  Roughly, these problems have to do with what                 the protagonists know about each other's knowledge and about the                system as a whole, and what can and cannot be said about these                  matters within the system.  These problems manifest themselves in               various ways, depending on the formal model being used.  For                    example within the standard \"partition\" model of knowledge, the                 problem is usually posed by asking, where do the particular                     partitions that are assumed come from, and does each player                     \"know\" the partitions of the others.  This project explores these               matters systematically and in detail.  The concepts of subjective               probability and rationality in multi-person contexts will also be               treated.  Applications to the foundations of interactive decision               making, game theory, computer science and biology will be                       considered.                                                                                                                                                     The results of this research will be presented in a monograph.                  The monograph will be divided into three or four parts.  The                    first part is devoted to the partition model of interactive                     knowledge theory.  A syntactical or propositional approach to                   knowledge partitions is adopted by the investigator in contrast                 to the usual hierarchical method.  The second part applies the                  same approach used for pure knowledge systems to probablistic                   \"belief\" systems.  In addition to elementary propositions,                      propositional connectives, and knowledge operators, probability                 operators will be used.  The rest of the monograph includes the                 following: irrationality, and/or lack of common knowledge of                    rationality; applications to equilibrium analysis in normal as                  well as extensive form games; games played by Turing machines;                  and applications to computer systems and biological systems,                    where the term \"knowledge\" needs to be properly interpreted.",
