 "awd_abstract_narration": "A subsonic wind tunnel for gust simulation and measurement will                 be modified and regimented  with a new control system. The gust                 generator employed is a novel device based upon a recently                      patented concept, the rotation slotted cylinder. The control                    system and equipment will have wide applications for nonlinear                  aeroelastic investigations for aircraft and rotorcraft,                         especially for the application of aerodynamic feedback techniques               to reduce aircraft and rotorcraft response. There is also the                   potential for the use of this gust generator and associated                     control system to provide a novel and improve aerodynamic or wind               excitation source for scaled models of bridges and buildings. By                means of a wind-tunnel gust generator, the harmonic components of               aerodynamic loads acting on a rotating blade can be simulated on                a non-rotating blade model. Higher harmonic control (HHC)                       concepts for reducing blade vibration response can therefore be                 investigated using the gust generator to produce aerodynamic                    excitation of the model at specified harmonics of a rotor blade                 system. The rotor blade model feedback control system will be                   based either on a PC-based controller similar to that planned for               the gust generator system or on a simple analog feedback                        controller. Regardless of the controller, the system software                   will provide the ability to enter a simple control law algorithm                or coefficients.***      //",
