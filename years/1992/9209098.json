 "awd_abstract_narration": "A framing effect occurs whenever a person is influenced by the way              in which information is described or presented (framed).  This                  Research Planning Grant will assist in the development of a                     research program which provides an intensive evaluation of                      differences in the encoding and processing of information as a                  function of positive and negative frames.  Recent evidence within               the domain of decision making under risk and related research in                psychology suggests that complex cognitive differences may exist in             response to information that is perceived as positive or negative.                                                                                              Several potential measures of positive and negative framing effects             will be examined to establish their usefulness and feasibility.                 These measures include assessments of preferences in risky choice,              information acquisition and use, response consistency, response                 times, changes in attitude, attentional biases and memory effects.              Studies will be proposed within typical experimental frameworks and             well as within the context of mass media.  The overriding goal is               to increase our knowledge of how cognition is influenced by the                 framing of information.",
