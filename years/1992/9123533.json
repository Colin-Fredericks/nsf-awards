Churchwell and                                a graduate student of the University of                                         Wisconsin to collaborate with Dr. Malcolm                                       Walmsley of the Max-Planck Institute for                                        Radioastronomy in Bonn, Germany.  They are                                      studying the conditions under which massive                                     stars form and subsequently evolve by                                           investigating the remaining molecular gas in                                    which the star is embedded and the star's                                       interaction with it.  In particular, they will                                  test the bow shock hypothesis by observing                                      carefully selected molecular and atomic lines                                   that probe the ionized and molecular gas.  These                                observations will be obtained from observations                                 at observatories in the U.S., Spain and Germany.                                This project is an important extension of the                                   ongoing research of Dr. Churchwell that would                                   not be possible without collaboration.  Dr.                                     Walmsley is an acknowledged expert on the                                       interstellar medium in general and particularly                                 on the computation and interpretation of the                                    physical conditions in interstellar molecular                                   and ionized gas clouds.  These areas are                                        particularly important to their joint research.                                 He also provides convenient access to the 100 m                                 telescope operated by the MPI in Germany and                                    brings expertise in using the specialized                                       instruments.  He will also collaborate closely                                  in developing detailed models of the molecular                                  gas.  Dr. Churchwell offers expertise in VLA                                    measurements and will use interferometric                                       instruments like the VLA in New Mexico to make                                  observations in the US to study these objects                                   with high spatial resolution.                                                                                                                                   Massive stars are formed in dense condensations                                 of molecular gas inside of giant molecular                                      clouds.  They play a crucial role in the                                        energetics of galaxies and the interstellar                                     medium, but their formation and early evolution                                 are poorly understood.  This project will                                       contribute new insights into the formation of                                   such massive stars by obtaining detailed                                        physical parameters and spatial distribution of                                 the  surrounding hot gas.",
