 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new research project will study issues concerning dynamical                electronic response and many-body effects of real metals, both at               the surface and in the bulk.  The emphasis will be first-principles             treatment of the electron-density response function and the                     electron self-energy.  The goal is the realistic treatment and                  description of electronic excitation in real metals, and through                such understanding obtaining explanations for numerous experimental             results which deviate strongly from the results predicted by                    simpler (density-functional) theory.                                            %%%                                                                             The mechanical properties of materials are determined primarily by              their static electronic structure.  Calculations of the static                  electronic structure is more-or-less routine for a wide range of                materials.  However, dynamic properties, such as the response of a              material to light or to rapidly moving ions, are generally not                  within the scope of these conventional approaches.  This project                intends to develop new classes of techniques which are both                     accurate and tractible when applied to such dynamical phenomena.",
