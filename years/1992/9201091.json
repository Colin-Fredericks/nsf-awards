 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lin will study various new knot invariants and related                     topology.  In the first part of this project, he intends to put the             knot signature into the framework of instanton invariants of 3-                 manifolds.  Considered in the context of an equivariant Floer                   theory, the signature invariant is expected to provide a new                    insight into some old problems in knot theory, e.g., the estimate               of the unknotting number.  In the second part, he will explore the              relationship established between knot polynomials and Vassiliev's               knot invariants.  He anticipates finding a combinatorial                        construction of knot invariants from Vassiliev's initial data.                  These knot invariants determine essentially all generalized Jones               polynomials derived via quantum groups.  He also hopes to get some              information about the outstanding problem of finding non-trivial                knots with trivial Jones polynomials from Vassiliev's knot                      invariants.                                                                          Knots are rather elementary geometric objects whose really                 interesting properties are topological.  By this we mean that two               geometric knots do not differ in an interesting way if one of them              can be transformed to look just like the other without cutting or               untying it, just by pushing its string about to rearrange the                   crossings.  Topologists say that they are two different geometric               realizations of the same topological knot.  Nevertheless, it is not             a trivial matter to recognize when one complicated geometric knot               is topologically different from another, rather than just a                     different geometric realization.  This problem can be addressed by              computing certain numbers or polynomials which are called                       \"topological invariants,\" meaning that they always have the same                value for different geometric realizations of the same topological              knot.  The problem would be reduced to pure algebra if there were               one invariant which also always had different values for geometric              realizations of different topological knots, but life is not so                 simple -- no single invariant achieves this ideal, nor even all the             known invariants taken together.  It is therefore valuable to                   investigate new invariants, some of the most useful being those                 inspired in recent years by ideas from quantum physics. In                      particular, applications of knot theory to the biology of long                  strands of DNA have drawn upon knowledge of these newer invariants.",
