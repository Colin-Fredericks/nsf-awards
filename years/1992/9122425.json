 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic question addressed in this project is to what extent do               family circumstances and events during childhood affect a child's               achievements and economic status in young adulthood.  On the                    basis of economic and sociological theory, and preliminary                      evidence the following childhood circumstances and events are                   analyzed: (1) The economic resources of the family which  include               income levels, the source of income (whether earned or welfare                  transfers), the nature of housing tenure, and the amount of time                parents spent with the child;  (2) Stressful events in life such                as divorce, separation, death, remarriage, and geographical                     changes in residence;  (3) Neighborhood characteristics like the                local poverty rate, unemployment, and welfare dependency;  (4)                  Educational attainment in terms of years of schooling;  (5)                     Economic productivity measured in terms of wage rates and                       earnings in post-school full time employment; and (6)  Teenage                  pregnancy and welfare dependency for young adult women.                                                                                                         The purpose of this research is to develop models characterizing                the relationship between --family economic resources, family                    stress, and neighborhood characteristics when a child-- and                     economics success when adult; and then to estimate these models.                The models will be drawn from both the economic and sociological                literature, and the estimation will employ a data set consisting                of 21 years of longitudinal data on 1800 children aged 0-6 in                   1968 and their siblings.  The determinants of economic success                  will be estimated by fitting statistical models to the data,                    moving from the most straightforward regression estimates to                    models designed to both capture the sequential nature of                        individual decisions and account for inherent limitations of the                data.",
