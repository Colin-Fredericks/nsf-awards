 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benthic carbon oxidation, denitrification, and benthic fluxes will              be studied in continental slope and deeper continental margin                   sediments off the Pacific Northwest coast and the coast of western              Mexico.  Previous work off Washington State indicates that a                    significant amount of the expected carbon rain to shelf sediments               is swept off the shelf and is not accumulating or being oxidized on             the upper slope.  Others have suggested carbon oxidation in                     sediments near the base off the continental slope is anomalously                high and that these sediments account for a major portion of the                total ocean basin sediment metabolism.  As high sedimentary carbon              oxidation is frequently accompanied by denitrification,                         denitrification in slope and deeper sediments could be important in             the marine combined nitrogen budget.  Specific questions to be                  addressed are:  1) What are the carbon oxidation rates and                      associated benthic fluxes in slope and deeper continental margin                sediments, are rates anomalously high, and are there relationships              between flux and variables such as depth, distance from shore, and              dissolved oxygen?  2) What is the magnitude of denitrification in               these sediments?  and 3) What is the magnitude of the isotopic                  fractionation during denitrification and does it depend on whether              the denitrification takes place in the sediments or in the water                column?",
