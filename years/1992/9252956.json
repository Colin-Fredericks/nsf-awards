 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will address two fundamental                        aspects of transcription by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase,                    namely, its tendency to undergo abortive initiation and its                     mechanism of translocation during transcription elongation.                     To clarify the first question, the P.I. will perform direct and                 quantitative comparisons, under a standardized reaction                         condition, of the extent and pattern of abortive initiation by a                comprehensive set of E. coli promoters.  The results of this                    determination may lead to sequence-specific correlations of                     abortive initiation with the initial transcribed sequence of each               promoter.  The second question is aimed at resolving two                        currently conflicting models of RNA polymerase translocation-                   one continuous and the other discontinuous-with the growth                      of the RNA chain.  Experimentally, footprinting analysis with                   DNase I, exonuclease III, hydroxyl radical, and potassium                       permanganate will be performed on a contiguous set of                           specifically-halted elongating complexes.                                             RNA polymerase is a central enzyme in the regulation                      of gene expression.  Despite extensive investigation, many                      aspects of its catalytic mechanisms remain controversial and                    unclear.  This work should forge a clearer picture of how                       translocation occurs.                                                                 The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                    opportunities for women to advance their careers in science                     or engineering through research, and to encourage other                         women to pursue careers in these areas through the                              investigator's enhanced visibility as a role model on the host                  campus.  The proposed activities which contribute to the                        second objective include:  teaching part of the introductory                    Biochemistry course to non-biochemistry science majors;                         mentoring and advising students;  and directing                                 undergraduate and graduate students working on research.",
