 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is to introduce undergraduate students                   to the scientific study of visual perception.  Students                         enrolled in various psychology courses will serve as                            experimenters, subjects, and data analysts as they empirically                  investigate phenomena related to spatial, color, form, depth,                   and motion perception.  This project will affect a broad range                  of students as the new laboratories are targeted at freshmen-                   level courses for non-majors up through senior-level courses                    reserved for psychology majors.   While earlier vision-related                  coursework has relied on non-interactive, passive                               demonstrations of visual phenomena, the requested equipment                     allows the implementation of a hands-on, interactive student                    laboratory.  A comprehensive, flexible computerized system                      capable of handling many different visual perception                            experiments represents the specialized equipment needed to                      carry out the planned laboratories.  The set-up centers around                  a high-speed computerized display system that is capable of                     delivering well controlled, ultra-high resolution graphic                       stimuli.  Collectively, this system gives undergraduate                         students a chance to experience the scientific procedures                       involved in studying the human visual system.",
