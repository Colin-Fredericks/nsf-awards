In research                            conducted under that award, the investigators performed                         supercritical extraction of model synthetic mixtures of                         organic pollutants in water solutions and concluded that a                      process based upon this concept is feasible for removal of                      contaminants from water solution.  The objective of work                        under this Renewal Award is to obtain a better                                  understanding than now exists of the properties of the                          process such as its thermodynamic characteristics and rate                      at which it functions as a steps toward evaluating its                          engineering relevance and significance.  Knowledge                              obtained in this research will then be applied to                               improvement of models that may be used in engineering                           design of the process and systems utilizing it.                                                                                                                 The supercritical extraction process being studied in this                      research is potentially especially applicable to treatment                      of wastewaters that are contaminated with substances that                       are resistant to biological degradation.  Results of this                       research are expected to be applied to the engineering                          design of processes and systems based on use of                                 supercritical extraction for decontamination of aqueous                         wastes.",
