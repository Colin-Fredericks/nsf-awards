 "awd_abstract_narration": "Madagascar's land mollusks--remarkable of their taxonomic                  breadth, endemism, ancient affinities, often gigantic size, and                 extensive conchological radiations--are poorly understood in all                respects, are inadequately represented in the museums of the                    world, and are going extinct at an alarming rate.  An expedition                in 1990 revealed that the giant-shelled taxa are overdescribed                  and contain polytypic species of astounding morphological                       diversity, and that the minute-to-small-sized taxa contain                      virtually unexplored major radiations consisting of hundreds to                 thousands of undescribed species.  Total diversity is predicted                 to be three to ten times the currently recognized 378 species.                  Three expeditions will collect a total of 1,260 sites in regions                of known or predicted high diversity, emphasizing uncollected,                  unprotected areas undergoing deforestation; year-long sampling at               a rain-forest site will provide unprecedented data on seasonal                  and micro-geographic patterns of diversity.  The products of this               research will be (a) an estimated 9,600 computer-cataloged museum               lots of shells and ethanol-preserved specimens, and 2,520 frozen                tissue samples, all advertised in a published catalog; (b)                      discovery of a predicted 354 new species; and (c) increased                     Malagasy awareness of the island's molluscan resources via school               lectures, reference collections, and species-identification                     catalogs.",
