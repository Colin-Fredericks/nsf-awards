 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the black markets for foreign                    currency and goods in the former Soviet Union and Eastern                       Europe.  Parallel markets in goods and currency are influenced by               developments in the official and unofficial markets for foreign-                currency trade and by economic-reform initiatives.  The objective               of the research is to trace, both theoretically and empirically, the            implications of anticipated and unanticipated policy reforms for                hoarding of consumption goods, inflation, the black-market                      exchange rate, and black-market trade volumes in the former                     Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  The methodological approach                   is drawn from the theory of exchange-rate determination, with the               portfolio theory of asset demands and exchange-rate                             determination agumented to show that when there are shortages                   in goods markets and individuals tend to hoard goods as a form                  of investment, with black-market exchange rates biased predictors               of the post-reform equilibrium exchange rates.  Announcements of                reform can lead short-run exchange rates to overshoot or                        undershoot (depending on the announcement) long-run                             equilibrium levels.  The empirical work will examine black-market               exchange rates (buy and sell rates) between the rouble and the                  dollar, as drawn from bi-weekly sampling of Moscow black-market                 currency dealers.  The determinants of black-market exchange-                   rate movements will be identified empirically, as will be the                   determinants of the spread between the bid and ask prices in this               market.  If appropriate data is available, black-market prices for              goods also will be studied.  Exchange rate and price data for the               Baltic nations also may be examined.                                                  This research will provide insights into the distortions                  caused when governments use black-market rates to choose                        levels of official exchange rates.                                                    The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                    opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    teaching a course in International Finance; presenting independent              research on \"Exchange-Rate Regimes in Transition Economies\" in                  departmental seminars in International Economics and                            Comparative Economic Studies; regularly participating in the                    International Economics seminar program; and working to                         promote the achievement of women in economics by active                         involvement with female graduate students through the established               support group \"Women in Economics.\"",
