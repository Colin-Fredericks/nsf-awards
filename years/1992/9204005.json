 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ji will investigate noncommutative differential geometry on                operator algebras associated with discrete groups, C*-dynamical                 systems, and strict deformation quantization of a cotangent space               of a smooth manifold.  Central to this study is the construction of             smooth and dense subalgebras of the corresponding C*-algebras.                  Completion of the projects will enable Ji to elucidate certain deep             properties of operator algebras, such as a partial solution to the              generalized Kadison conjecture, a further understanding of the                  noncommutative Toeplitz index theory, and a new birth of certain                noncommutative manifolds.                                                            The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently                being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
