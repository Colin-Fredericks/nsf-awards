The central and eastern regions of                                              the United States have a large                                                  inventory of such buildings.                                                    Progressive collapse can result                                                 from punching failure at                                                        connections.                                                                                                                                                    The main objective of the project                                               is to develop minimum-retrofit                                                  strategies to limit the global                                                  response and ensure structural                                                  integrity during moderate ground                                                motion.  To accomplish this, a                                                  suitable analysis tool for                                                      predicting the response of non-                                                 ductile flat-slab buildings under                                               earthquake loading will be                                                      developed first.  A recently                                                    developed three-parameter                                                       hysteretic model will be                                                        incorporated into an                                                            existingnonlinear dynamic analysis                                              program to analyze and compare                                                  various retrofit strategies.                                                    Experiments aiming at testing                                                   retrofit schemes at the connection                                              level for protection against                                                    progressive collapse and controlled                                             redistribution of loads will also                                               be carried out.  In particular, the                                             concept of using infill walls to                                                improve the lateral load resistance                                             will be studied in some detail.                                                 With both experimental and                                                      analytical studies, this project is                                             expected to provide an integrated                                               retrofit strategy optimized for a                                               balance between protection at the                                               connection level and a controlled                                               global response.
