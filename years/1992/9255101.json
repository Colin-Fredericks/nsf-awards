 "awd_abstract_narration": "Florida A&M University and Florida State University are                         collaborating to conduct a five-year program which will directly                involve 120 exemplary minority engineering undergraduates enrolled              in chemical, civil, electrical, industrial and mechanical                       engineering curricula.  Participants will 1) collaborate on faculty             research and perform research-oriented industrial internships, 2)               receive academic advising and mentoring by faculty researchers and              professional mentoring by prominent minority scientists, and 3)                 receive academic enrichment and enhancement in preparation for                  graduate study.  Participants will have the opportunity to present              the results of their research at technical conferences.  Program                activities guide participants from the pre-college level to                     successful entry into graduate research programs.  Participants                 receive graduated stipend supplements (in addition to any other                 scholarships which they are receiving) which are scaled from                    $111/month for first year students through $333/month for fifth                 year students.                                                                                                                                                  Successful completion of the program activities will result in the              acceptance into an completion of graduate research degree programs              by 85% of program graduates and acceptance into doctoral research               programs by 40% of program graduates.                                                                                                                           These results will be achieved in an extremely cost-effective                   manner.  Annual project costs average $3700 per participant;                    cumulative project costs are $11,638 per participant.  Total                    personnel costs are only 26% of the budget; senior personnel costs              are 2.3% of the budget.  Annual cost sharing by the College is 46%              of the funding requested from NSF.",
