The CAMS initiative addresses several barriers to                      improvement of K-6 science and middle grades mathematics                        programs in the state.  The program has three objectives:                                                                                                       1.   Galvanizing public support for improving mathematics                            and science education.                                                                                                                                     2.   Developing and promoting elementary science                                     instruction.                                                                                                                                               3.   Replacing the usual curriculum and instructional                                features of middle grades mathematics instruction with                          materials and activities consistent with NCTM                                   Standards.                                                                                                                                                 The CAMS initiative will make use of special meetings with                      policymakers, business and community leaders, and educators                     to heighten public awareness of the importance of science                       and mathematics education.  Professional development and                        support will provide the basis for improved science                             instruction in the elementary grades and mathematics                            instruction in the middle grades.",
