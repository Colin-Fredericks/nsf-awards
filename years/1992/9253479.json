 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a pilot for a half-hour, weekly children's science                      education series produced for broadcast on PBS by                               McKenna/Gottlied Productions, Inc. and KCTS Television in                       Seattle, Washington.  One half-hour program and prototype                       ancillary material will be produced and tested with children,                   parents, and teachers.                                                                                                                                          The series is designed to make science accessible and                           interesting to children ages 9 to 12 by relating science to                     their interests and everyday activities and by presenting basic                 concepts from elementary science curricula in a humorous and                    exciting format.  The host is Bill Nye, a popular television                    entertainer and science aficionado.  In each program, Nye is                    assisted by children, well-known science experts, and celebrity                 guests.  Experiments and demonstrations will use inexpensive,                   safe household items to enable viewers to follow along at home                  or in the classroom.  Ancillary material will consist of a                      parent's guide to assist parents in encouraging their children                  to participate in science activities and develop problem-solving                skills, activity cards for children to encourage self-directed                  learning, and a teacher's guide to support classroom use.",
