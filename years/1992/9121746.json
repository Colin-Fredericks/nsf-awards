 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project contributes supplemental funds to aid the                          dissertation research of a student of cultural anthropology.  The               project studies the meanings of drinking, drunkenness and                       sobriety among different groups of urban American Indians in                    Minneapolis.  Through analysis of conversational and narrative                  discourse the student investigates the role of drinking in urban                Indian life, and proposes to examine the differences between                    situational and cultural factors affecting the meaning of                       drinking to urban Indians.  Methods include sampling different                  levels of drinkers (binge, moderate, abstinent), tribes (Dakota,                Ojibwe) as well as differences between men and women.                                                                                                           This research is important because alcohol abuse is a serious                   problem in urban Indian communities, and increased understanding                of how drinking is understood by different segments of the                      community can help health specialists develop intervention                      programs.",
