 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Global Weather Experiment (GWE) of early 1979 deployed                 augmented observational systems that offered, for the first time,               truly global coverage at least on the largest (planetary wave)                  scales of the atmospheric circulation.  Analysis techniques were                subsequently developed that merged these observations with the                  output of continually running numerical models to obtain data sets              consistent with the physical and dynamical laws built into the                  models.  Research with these data sets has provided new insights on             planetary-scale circulation features which vary slowly over intra-              seasonal to seasonal periods.  Dr. Nogues-Paegle will use a 10-year             data set, which was prepared with state-of-the-art techniques for               assimilating observations into numerical model solutions, to look               at the vertical structure of such circulation features.  The                    vertical structure detected will provide an indication as to the                relative roles of local and remote energy sources in the excitation             and maintenance of the quasi-stationary waves composing these                   features.  The results should guide the development of general                  circulation models so they simulate seasonal and intraseasonal                  changes more accurately.  Such improved predictions will have                   enhanced credibility and utility in the framing of environmental                policy and economic resource allocation decisions.",
