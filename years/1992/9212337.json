 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analyses of applied problems and the nature of public interest in               them is used to motivate and strengthen the examination of the                  informational base of welfare economics and choice theory.                      Particular attention is paid to the neglect in traditional welfare              economics of considerations other than utility, including freedoms,             rights, and liberties, on the one hand, and also health and                     morbidity, in which the public take a prominent and direct                      interest.  Similarly, the concentration of traditional rational                 choice theory on intelligent pursuit of self-interest leads to the              neglect of other norms and values, such as loyalty, commitment, and             fairness, which figure more prominently in public understanding of              actual motives for action.  These perceptual features require                   critical scrutiny and discriminating assessment in the light of                 their practical relevance as well as conceptual viability.                                                                                                      The results of the theoretical investigations will be applied to                the study of policy responses to global environmental change.                   Public discussions of environmental issues are often dominated by               alleged violations of rights and entitlement, and also by fear of               increased illness and death in addition to forecasts of economic                disasters.  These concerns sometimes serve as the basis of unifocal             recommendations and fairly extreme solutions based on assessments               involving the neglect of other aspects of the problem.  This                    project accepts the legitimacy of these concerns and then links                 them with other concerns, with reasoned assessment of defendable                trade-offs and relative weights.  Public discussions of global                  warming are often much influenced by the rhetoric of equity and                 justice, e.g., between poor countries than cannot easily afford to              pay for the proposed policies and rich ones that are seen as having             an obligation to help.  Since the gap between rhetoric and                      political feasibility can be quite large, it can lead to proposals              that deflect discussion from what might really be possible to do.               Equity considerations are important and will be integrated within               a framework of rational assessment and informed political                       discussion, making them less ambitious but possibly more effective.",
