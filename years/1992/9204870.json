 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will purchase two suitable PC systems for the                 College Heights Weather Station located in the Department of                    geography and Geology at Western Kentucky University.  This weather             station is a vital laboratory facility for  physical geography                  students in the Meteorology/Climatology track-Baccalaureate Degree,             and Meteorological Technology-Associate Degree programs.  In                    addition to departmental majors, students enrolled in introductory              weather and climate courses total 500-600 students per year.  In                total, no less than five faculty will derive benefit by the output              from the funded equipment.  The new equipment will complement the               recently acquired Zephyr Weather Satellite Receiving System to take             full advantage of the PC-McIDAS capabilities and fully participate              in the UNIDATA Program.  The products produced from this new                    hardware coupled with UNIDATA software and services will be                     integrated into various levels of coursework offered in the                     department.  The principal investigator will write a new set of                 laboratory exercises and restructure course curriculum elevating                them to state-of-the-art status.  As such, new avenues for research             and hands-on experience will benefit students and faculty alike.                The newly equipped College Heights Weather Station coupled with the             Kentucky Climate Center (also housed in the Department of Geography             and Geology) will make Western Kentucky University a focus for the              study of atmospheric sciences in Kentucky.  It is also expected                 that positions of employment and acceptance into graduate programs              will increase for our graduates as they demonstrate an enhanced                 understanding of weather systems.",
