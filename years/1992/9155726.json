 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to investigate questioning                       processes during science instruction.  Data sources include                     audio-and, video-tapes of science activities, interviews                        with students and teachers, journal entries, and student                        written work.  Analysis involves collaboration among                            elementary school teachers and university researchers in                        producing narrative analyses of transcripts of classroom                        conversations during science lessons.  The analysis also                        includes examining: a) forms and functions of questions                         asked by both students and teachers; b) the nature of                           spontaneous questions by students; c) the nature of                             spontaneous questions by teachers as adult learners in                          teacher education workshops at the Exploratorium; d)                            structural patterns of classroom questioning; e) uses of                        questions in implementing and monitoring instructional                          decisions; and f) developmental differences in questioning                      among students in different grade levels.  Participating                        teachers are encouraged to conduct research on questioning                      processes in their own classrooms and to share results at                       meetings at the University of California at Berkeley during                     the academic year.  The project also provides research                          opportunities for undergraduates.  Participation by minority                    students and teachers is encouraged in all activities.",
