 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support to study crime and its linkages to                  urbanization and industrialization in early America.  Specifically,             the grant provides support to collect and collate data from public              records on persons accused of crimes and their accusers or                      prosecutors in the justice system of Pennsylvania, 1682-1800,                   specifically in Chester County and the City of Philadelphia.  The               data treat their economic and vocational status as well as                      residence and their previous domiciles.  The analysis concentrates              on a number of issues related to the etiology of crime,                         particularly whether the identification of the criminal population              changes consistent with shifts in the economic and labor structure              of these locales.  Also, the evolution of the criminal population               in the City of Philadelphia is traced to determine whether it                   fulfills postulates about the relationship between urbanization and             the proliferation of crime.                                                                                                                                     This study deals with central issues related to the etiology of                 crime, and the richness of the historical data will enable scholars             interested in various facets of crime causation to advance inquiry              of their own postulates about the interfaces among crime,                       industrialization, and urbanization.  Further, the availability of              the sentencing data will provide an opportunity to determine early              penal policy in the United States, and gain rich understanding of               how the Quakers operationalized their penal philosophy.  These data             and their analysis provide historical context for advancing debates             about the purpose of punishment in the United States.",
