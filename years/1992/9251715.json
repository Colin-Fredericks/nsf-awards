 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new experimental apparatus is being constructed in the                        chemical engineering unit operations laboratory at Lehigh                       University.  The equipment illustrates the effects of various                   design and operating parameters in a coupled chemical process:                  a reactor with a distillation column mounted on top.  While                     distillation and reaction processes are well established, the                   design and operation of the coupled units represent a novel and                 challenging problem for chemical engineering undergraduates.                    When appropriate, this type of reactive distillation process                    has significant advantages over the decoupled system: (1)                       yields and conversions can be increased and reactor size                        reduced by removing one of the products of the reaction by                      distillation, and (2) energy consumption can be reduced by                      using the heat of reaction to generate vapor for the separation                 in the column.  The major pieces of the apparatus are a reactor                 and distillation column, and other equipment include condenser,                 reflux drum, vacuum pumps, control valves, feed and reflux                      pumps, and tankage for feed and products.  The experiment is                    used in a senior laboratory for undergraduate chemical                          engineering students, and is the first time that these students                 have been exposed to a complex process which combines two unit                  operations.  Thus, it provides a deeper understanding of the                    underlying principles involved in the design and operation of                   both chemical reactors and distillation columns, and                            illustrates the sometimes obvious and the sometimes subtle                      interactions between these two operations.",
