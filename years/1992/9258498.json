 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. Jean-Laurent Rosenthal under                 the National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards                     program.  The objectives of this program are to recognize                       outstanding young faculty in science and engineering, to enhance                the academic career of recent Ph.D. recipients, and to foster                   contact and cooperation between academia and industry.  Dr.                     Rosenthal has already made significant research contributions in                the field of economic history, and he has the potential to become               a leader in academic research and education.                                                                                                                    This award allow him to pursue his research interests in the area               of credit markets.  Dr. Rosenthal intends to analyze credit                     markets in France for the period 1675 to 1860.  A major component               of this research will involve the extensive collection of data                  from various French archives.  These data will consist of                       individual credit transactions and will be linked to other                      sources of information about borrowers and lenders.  The research               agenda is important because it will shed new light on the                       relationship between the evolution of credit markets and economic               growth and development.  The research findings could have                       important implications for the establishing credit markets in the               transition economies of Eastern Europe.",
