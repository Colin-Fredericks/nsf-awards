The model is based on a particular                dynamical systems approach called task dynamics, which abstractly               characterizes speech gestures in terms of coordinated patterns of               articular movements during speech production.  The relative                     timing and parameterization of the gestures comprising a given                  utterance are specified by a gestural score that is generated by                the model's linguistic gestural component.  The focus of furhter                development is the interaction of gestural organization with the                global rhythimic structure of speech.  Model development will be                guided by collecting articulatory data showing the influence of                 stress on patterns of gestural cohesion.  Also, the different                   types of gestural patterns that underlie reduced syllables will                 be investigated, in data to be collected from speakers of                       English, French and Hebrew.  Because the model is based on such                 articulatory evidence, it particularly appropriate as a phonetic                framework for use with recent non-linear phonologies that                       emphasize the phonological relevance of articulatory features.                  Futher, because the model is couched within a dynamical systems                 approach, it provides a concise and principled account of much                  variation in phonetic structures in terms of spatial and temporal               overlap among speech gestures.",
