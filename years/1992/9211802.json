 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will make the first direct measurements of a               low altitude atmospheric plume that has been observed in satellite              imagery as rising from the sea ice in the vicinity of Bennett                   Island in the Arctic Ocean.  It has been hypothesized that the                  plume consists of rapidly escaping methane released from the                    melting and vaporization of methane hydrates along a fault                      structure, but to date there has been no direct confirmation of                 this conjecture.                                                                        This work will be supported under the Small Grants for                  Exploratory Research Program (SGER), which includes in its                      objectives the support of research that is risky and has severe                 urgency with regard to availablity of facilities.  In this instance             the field work will be a month-long deployment of a Russian AN-2                aircraft to the vicinity of Bennett Island following the already                scheduled Arctic Gas and Aerosol Sampling Program (AGASP-4),                    sponsored by NOAA, in March and April of 1992.  This will take                  advantage of the fact that the aircraft will already have been                  equipped with a suite of atmospheric chemistry instrumentation, and             will only require the installation of a separate sample inlet line.                     The work will identify the composition of the Bennett                   Island plume, and if it is in fact largely methane, will allow a                determination of the age of the source hydrates.  This in turn will             promote the construction of a global methane budget, and assess its             effect as a radiatively important trace species on the global                   radiation budget.",
