 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study problems in geometric                tomography and develop methods to reconstruct the geometry of                   convex bodies from projections. In particular he will explore new               directions in the algorithmic aspects of reconstructing convex                  bodies and polytopes from X-rays, their interactive determination               from X-rays, and the classification of intersection bodies. Two                 undergraduate students will work on parts of the project under                  the direction of the principal investigator.                                         This award will support research in the general area of                    integral geometry. The geometry of a set may often be analyzed                  and described by a decomposition of the set into slices. The                    geometry of the slices is often fairly simple and easy to                       describe. The main difficulty in the analysis is usually the                    reconstruction of the underlying geometric features of the entire               set from the geometry of the slices. One well know application of               this area of mathematics is the CAT scan.",
