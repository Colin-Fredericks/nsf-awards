 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates and enhances experiments which provide the                 students with hands-on experience associated with modern data                   acquisition and signal analysis techniques.  A comprehensive                    plan is being implemented that provides a framework for the                     long-term development and enhancement of these labs. Also                       included in this plan are curriculum and administrative                         improvements which effect a greater coordination between the                    lecture and laboratory courses. The current strategy is to                      attain the goals of significantly increasing individualized                     hands-on student involvement in experimental procedures, data                   acquisition and signal analysis without resorting to the                        construction of multiple facility replications.  The project                    employs hand-held Fluke Scopemeters and Portable NeXT computers                 to achieve, inexpensive, and novel means to accomplish these                    goals by putting each two person lab group in complete control                  of the data acquisition and signal analysis aspects of a number                 of existing experiments, as well as a few new experiments                       currently being built.  Furthermore, the equipment provides a                   foundation for long term laboratory development, expansion, and                 enhancement. The equipment utilization described herein                         represents an economical and educationally valuable  means of                   extracting maximum use out of a limited number of experimental                  facilities.",
