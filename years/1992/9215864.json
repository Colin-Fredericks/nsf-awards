 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a planning study to develop a five-year  plan              for a collaborative research program conducted by the Hazardous                 Substance Management Research Center (HSMRC) at the New Jersey                  Institute of Technology in Newark, NJ, the Center for Process                   Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) at the University of Washington in                  Seattle, WA, to perform research and develop and demonstrate new                technologies for the prevention, treatment and remediation of                   hazardous substances.  A key component of the research program will             be the development and application of innovative measurement                    technologies to improve process control and monitoring, leading to              optimization and cost-effective hazardous substance management                  technologies.                                                                        The proposed collaborative research program affords the                    opportunity to link the facilities and capabilities of two National             Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers             (I/UCRCs), each one having a defined technical focus, along with                their industrial partners, to assist DOE's Environmental                        Restoration and Waste Management (EM) Program.  A unique feature of             the proposed program is the ability to actively involve industry in             the program.  Furthermore, this collaboration will be strengthened              by other ongoing CPAC and HSMRC research projects with DOE                      facilities, including:  Sandia and Los Alamos National                          Laboratories, Westinghouse Hanford and Savannah River Sites, and                (Battelle) Pacific Northwest Laboratories.                                           The Principal Investigators and colleagues have the experience             and capabilities to perform this study.                                              The Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste             Management Program is providing the primary support for this                    project.                                                                             The Program Manager recommends the New Jersey Institute of                 Technology be awarded $125,000 for one year for this project as                 partial funding.  (The remaining funding will be given as a                     unilateral award in FY93).",
