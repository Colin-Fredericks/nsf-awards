 "awd_abstract_narration": "The calculus-based introductory physics course, with an annual                  enrollment of roughly 150,000 students, is the educational                      cornerstone for all physical science and engineering majors as                  well as the primary influence on general physics courses at                     lower levels. This project draws upon: 1) physics education                     research, 2) computer technology and software development for                   physics, and 3) guidelines developed by the Introductory                        University Physics Project in order to develop a unified new                    curriculum for the course. Emphasis is placed on incorporating                  effective pedagogy into the course, on the use of a \"story                      line\" and improved course structure, and on bringing a                          significant component of 20th century physics into the course.                  The aspect of this course that sets it apart from curriculum                    development efforts elsewhere is that it is aimed primarily at                  universities that teach large numbers of students. This is the                  target audience that must be reached if new developments in                     science education are to succeed. Specific attention will be                    given to the many constraints that a large university setting                   places on the course.",
