 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of research being proposed involves the                          management and exchange of the knowledge required to                            facilitate Concurrent Engineering (CE).  A large element of CE                  involves the integration of separate, specialized disciplines.                  Each engineering or business group has its own valuable                         knowledge that it uses to accomplish its task.  In a CE                         environment, the communication of this knowledge is of                          primary concern.                                                                      This project proposes investigation in the interaction,                   communication, and integration of specialized knowledge.                        Each body of specialized knowledge is viewed as a                               knowledge source, and it is of particular interest to                           understand, simplify, and formalize ways for sharing this                       engineering/business knowledge.                                                       The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                    opportunities for women to advance their careers in science                     or engineering through research, and to encourage other                         women to pursue careers in these areas through the                              investigator's enhanced visibility as a role model on the host                  campus.  The proposed activities which contribute to the                        second objective include:  visiting five northeastern universities              to give technical seminars; leading a seminar series at the                     host institution, tentatively titled,  \"Intelligent Systems in                  Manufacturing and Concurrent Engineering;\" teaching one                         course per semester at the School of Industrial Engineering,                    namely, Computer Integrated Manufacturing, and Expert                           Systems; and mentoring students.",
