 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advent of modern molecular methods for genetic                    analysis, it has become feasible to study ever more refined                     aspects of the genetic structure of populations.  The                           developments have stimulated considerable growth in studies of                  the genealogical structure of populations, as well as                           investigation into the composition of populations of mixed                      genetic background.  These two fields of study are based on                     common molecular and statistical tools, but have largely been                   developed in isolation from one another.  The proposed symposium                will provide a forum for presentation, comparison, and discussion               of the various approaches currently available for genealogical                  analysis and strain identification.  Participants have been drawn               from a national pool, and the proceeding will be publicized on a                national level as well.  This symposium will bring together                     scientific leaders in various related areas in a way that is                    certain to generate useful interaction, and that could give rise                to fruitful future collaborations.  Finally, this symposium is                  being structured in a way that will encourage attendance by                     graduate students, so that people in their formative stages will                have the opportunity to benefit directly from the intellectual                  synergism that will arise from this meeting.",
