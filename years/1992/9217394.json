The                  ideal proposal provides not only excellence in basic research:                  focussed problem with potential for substantial impact in critical              area(s) of science and engineering, but also significant                        interactions between the various disciplinary and computational                 activities involving mathematical, computer or computational                    scientists, that would have an impact in high performance                       computational activity beyond the specific problem area(s) or                   discipline being studied.  These are the goals of this project                  which is a collaboration between applied mathematics, astrophysics,             computer and computational science, engineering, geophysical                    sciences, to develop parallel algorithms for problems relating to               Coupled Fields and Coherent Structures and Geophysical and                      Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics (GAFD) Turbulence.  The common                     denominator of the various application areas are performance                    measures, massive data sets, and the visualization of multi-                    terabyte data sets.  In addition to the expertise at the University             of Colorado at Boulder, scientists at the National Center for                   Atmospheric Research (NCAR) will contribute to geostrophic                      turbulence and ocean convection research, and a sub-contract will               be given to the scientists at the University of Minnesota who will              contribute expertise in both astrophysics and visualization.",
