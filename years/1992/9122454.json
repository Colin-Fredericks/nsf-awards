 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many agreements in macroeconomics and international economics are               the outcomes of negotiations among a small number of participants               or, in a game theory setting, players.  This project has two                    objectives.  The first is to develop an analytical framework to                 study macroeconomic bargaining problems.  This framework will                   include an explicit model of macroeconomic bargaining and an                    equilibrium concept of sustainable bargaining equilibrium to                    represent the outcomes of the model.  The second objective is to                apply the bargaining model to analyze three important,                          contemporary, macroeconomic bargaining-problems.                                                                                                                The first application is to the monetary union problem faced by                 Europe in adopting a common currency.  Governments have                         conflicting interests because a common monetary policy is                       likely to result in the redistribution of wealth across member                  countries.  The second application involves the debt                            renegotiations problem between the developed and less developed                 countries.  Typical renegotiated agreements include rescheduling                of debt payments, new lending, and debt forgiveness.  Obviously,                banks and governments have opposite interests with respect to                   debt repayment and debt reduction schemes.  The final application               concerns negotiations between the major political parties in the                U.S regarding the budget deficit problem. In order to reduce the                federal deficit, opposition parties must agree on some                          combination of tax increases and expenditure cuts.   Conflicting                interests arise because the parties respond to different                        constituencies and have different preferences about alternative                 tax and expenditure packages.",
