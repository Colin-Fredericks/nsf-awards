 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new light valve, based on a novel two-layer architecture,              provides significantly higher aperture ratio/pixel density                      combinations than any of the currently available or proposed light              valves.  The use of polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) is                  selected as the choice LC medium for this application.  The                     combined VLSI/PDLC light valve will result in fabrication of an                 ultraminiature light valve with a projected cost factor which is                approximately an order of magnitude less than competing (lower                  resolution) displays currently under development.  The research                 effort will be devoted to a feasibility study which will involve                construction, testing and evaluation of the first experimental                  prototype valve based on combined VLSI/PDLC technologies.                            The work represents a new, innovative approach in the                      development of improved high resolution displays.  The core feature             of this new display centers on construction of a revolutionary new              light valve which combines state-of-the-art capabilities in very-               large-scale-integration (VLSI) and liquid crystal (LC)                          technologies.",
