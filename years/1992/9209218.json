 "awd_abstract_narration": "The synthesis and chemical reactivity of a variety of                           fluorinated reactive intermediates and related species will be                  investigated.  Among the intermediates to be characterized                      spectroscopically are triplet halocarbenes and                                  difluorovinylidene.  In addition, the thermal and photochemical                 reactivity of fluorinated cumulones, difluorocyclopropenone,                    difluoroacetylene, and fluoropropynoyl fluoride, will be                        studied.  In the case of the fluorinated cumulenones, as well                   as partially fluorinated fused cyclobutenes, semi-fluorinated                   polymers will be synthesized and characterized with respect to                  conductivity and selected physical properties.  In an attempt                   to define new methods for carbene production, photolysis of                     cyclic alkene derived ozonides will be investigated.                            %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing investigation of reactive fluorinated compounds by                   Professor W. P. Dailey at the University of Pennsylvania.  A                    major goal of the research will be to generate, detect, and                     follow the subsequent reactions of highly reactive                              intermediates called carbenes which only exist at room                          temperature for a fraction of a second.  Special spectroscopic                  techniques are required to identify these reactive carbenes,                    which are important since they control the rate and type of                     products formed in a variety of chemical transformations.  A                    secondary goal of the project will be to synthesize and                         characterize polymeric materials with fluorine groups attached.                 Such materials are of particular importance in fabricating                      surfaces with low surface tension capable of repelling water.",
