Istvan Bogardi                                    of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and                                      Lucien Duckstein of the University of                                           Arizona-Tucson, with Dr. Ferenc Rakoczi of                                      the Department of Meteorology, Eotvos                                           University, Budapest, Hungary, is to develop                                    methods to predict local hydrological                                           variables influenced by climate fluctuations                                    by defining a probabilistic linkage between                                     the occurrence and type of atmospheric                                          circulation patterns and (a) local                                              precipitation, (b) flood events, (c) dry                                        periods, and (d) lake levels.  With that                                        linkage, they will use available general                                        circulation model scenarios to predict the                                      hydrological quantities reflecting climate                                      change.  They will use and compare these                                        concepts to two drainage basins, in Hungary                                     and the U.S., and study lake level                                              fluctuations at Lake Balaton in Hungary and                                     the Great Salt Lake in Utah.  The results                                       should constitute a major input into water                                      resources decision-making, including the                                        mitigation of the effects of climate                                            fluctuation and global change on local                                          hydrology.
