 "awd_abstract_narration": "While \"rights\" are a central element of the American legal                      tradition, they have been largely ignored in Japan.  The social                 science literature about Japan is dominated by the assumption that              rights are an alien transplant incompatible with Japanese culture.              Japanese culture is seen as inhospitable to the \"Western\" notion                of rights which are perceived as pervading and controlling the                  political and legal dispositions of citizens and rulers alike.                  Japan's political culture is thought to include such                            characteristics as an avoidance of direct conflict, a deep-seated               respect for authority, and a strong desire for compromise and                   consensus.  These assumptions have been accepted by most scholars               of Japanese law and politics and, thus, a rigorous study of rights              in Japan has not been undertaken.                                                                                                                               This dissertation research rejects the notion that rights are                   unimportant in Japan and hypothesizes that rights are a critical                element of the process and substance of Japanese policymaking in                the courts and the legislature.  The study examines the role and                importance of individual rights in Japan in the context of                      contemporary health care conflicts.  The research will focus on                 legislation, litigation, and mediation involving AIDS, the                      definition of death (organ transplantation/brain death), and                    contraception.  Each of these areas has been the subject of intense             conflict and debate about individual rights and the limits of                   justifiable state interference.  The methodology will consist of                an analysis of several case studies and interviews with parties to              the disputes.  Among the major issues to be addressed are                       circumstances under which individual rights are invoked, the extent             to which lawmakers are responsive to such appeals, whether and how              rights are ultimately reconciled with community welfare, and the                similarities and differences between legislative, litigative, and               mediated visions of rights.                                                                                                                                     This study will be the first to explore the relationship between                individual rights, state power, and health policy in Japan,                     incorporating legal, political, and sociological perspectvies.  It              will offer new insight into the workings of Japanese law and                    politics, add to the debate on Japanese policymaking, enrich the                study of dispute resolution in Japan, and provide a new perspective             to the analysis of Japanese conflict.  It will also suggest                     comparative approaches to the study of rights at a time when there              is deep questioning in the U.S. about whether America's sense of                community has been eroded because of an overemphasis on rights and              the neglect of a sense of duty.",
