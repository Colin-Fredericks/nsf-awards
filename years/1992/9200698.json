 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the physics of                           electrification of thunderstorms, including the lightning                       discharge, using a numerical cloud model.  The formulation of                   riming charge transfer will be guided by recent laboratory results              showing the significance of both temperature and liquid water                   content.  Also, the significance of ice splintering in producing                lower positive charge centers will also be investigated.                                                                                                             Improvements in the lightning parameterization scheme will                 include a randomization of the propagation path based on the                    presence of random free electrons in the vicinity of the discharge              tip, the inclusion of the tip electric field in the path                        calculation, and a simulation of the cloud-to-ground discharge.                 These improvements and those mentioned above will be incorporated               in the three-dimensional model.  We will include a calculation of               the Maxwell current into our analysis software to test the                      inference of Krider and Musser (1982) concerning the role of                    inductive and noninductive processes in driving the Maxwell                     current.  Modeling studies of several new cases will be undertaken              with both 2D and 3D models to examine electrification processes in              various storms.",
