 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT PTRA-PLUS is a program of the American Association                      of Physics Teachers (AAPT) to provide updated instruction                       over three summers for 125 outstanding U.S. high school                         teachers previously trained to conduct teacher workshops as                     Physics Teaching Resources Agents (PTRAs).  Twenty-five new                     participants will be added to the group in each of the three                    years to bring the PTRA-PLUS complement to 200 by 1994.  In                     addition to an enhanced emphasis on physics content,                            particular attention will be devoted to increasing the                          enrollment and success of girls in physics classes and                          subsequent interest in the profession.  A second                                distinguishing characteristic of this new effort is the                         progressive movement to self-sufficiency of the PTRA                            program; AAPT plans to continue both the training of teacher                    workshops leaders and the administrative/logistical support                     of the workshop-outreach programs as the NSF funding is                         phased out.  Program participants will be required to                           conduct a minimum of five full-day teacher workshops per                        year in their home regions or states, resulting in some 2500                    workshops reaching as many as 50,000 physics and physical                       science teachers nationally over the three-year period of                       the National Science Foundation grant.  A comprehensive                         database fed primarily by an electronic network of program                      participants and maintained by the Project Directors for                        AAPT will assist in the scheduling, reporting, and                              monitoring of the outreach workshops as well as evaluating                      the effectiveness of summer training sessions.  Other                           distinct features of PROJECT PTRA-PLUS include the                              encouragement of partnerships between the participating high                    school teachers and college/university faculty and with                         teachers of minority students in their locale.  To further                      extend the effective duration of instruction and                                interaction, summer training sessions are typically                             scheduled for the week preceding the regular AAPT Summer                        Meeting, on the camps site of the meeting.  The first such                      session is scheduled for August of 1992 at the University of                    Maine in Orono.                                                                                                                                                 Cost sharing equals 10% of the NSF award.",
