 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methane gas hydrates may occur wherever methane and water exist in              close proximity at low temperatures and elevated pressures.  These              hydrates are thought to be widespread in both on-shore permafrost               regions of the North American and Soviet Arctic and in the shallow              continental shelves of the Arctic Ocean where sub-sea permafrost is             found.  Methane gas may be released to the atmosphere because of                hydrate destabilization as a result of climatic warming and changes             in sea level.  With present knowledge, it is not possible to                    predict the timing or the amount of methane that would be released              by gas hydrate decomposition as a result of permafrost, especially              sub-sea permafrost, degradation during interglacial periods.                                                                                                    We proposed to modify a two-dimensional model of climate-permafrost             interaction.  The model will be applied to several sites in North               America and in the Soviet Union to elevate the potential for gas                hydrate and permafrost occurrence and degradation in response to                changes in climate and sea level.  This information will be used                (in collaboration with USGS and Soviet investigators) to make                   improved estimates of the possible fluxes of methane onto the                   atmosphere as a result of hydrate and permafrost degradation.",
