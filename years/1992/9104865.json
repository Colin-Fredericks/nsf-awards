 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Abhijit Chandra of the University of Arizona                to collaborate in materials engineering research with Viggo                     Tvergaard of the Department of Solid Mechanics of the Technical                 University of Denmark.  They share an interest in the forming of                metal and in understanding the processes that affect the properties             of the finished product.  In particular, their collaborative research           focuses on understanding the phenomenon of local instabilities                  generated by interactions of microdefects in a damage cluster.                  Professor Tvergaard has developed various models for damage                     evolutions in situations involving plasticity and creep.  Professor             Chandra has worked extensively on metal forming processes and on                design sensitivities of these processes.  This complementary                    expertise is combined very effectively in the proposed collaborative            research plan.                                                                                                                                                  During a metal forming process, the workpiece material is                       subjected to intense stress and deformation fields.  As a result, the           material undergoes large plastic strains and rotations in order to              produce new and desirable shapes of the workpiece.  However, the                stress and deformation fields may cause local instabilities that may            nucleate microscopic voids.  Growth of such defects results in                  degradation of the mechanical properties of the finished product,               and may even lead to its failure.  The results of the proposed                  research will be very helpful in designing forming processes that               avoid or minimize the development of this damage in the                         workpiece.",
