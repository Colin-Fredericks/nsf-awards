 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cooper Union's Mechanical Engineering Department will establish                  an enhanced undergraduate Acoustics Laboratory.  Acoustics and                 vibration control is increasing in prominence among the                         engineering disciplines. Cooper Union's enhanced and expanded                   acoustics/vibrations lab will permit undergraduate hands-on                     experience with sound intensity probes and force hammers, as                    well as a greater understanding of the implications of random                   and sine sweeps of vibration generated by a shaker . Also, the                  concept of modal analysis of a structure undergoing vibration                   is clarified by the use of an accompanying modal analysis                       computer program.  An expanded acoustics/vibrations laboratory                  of this type provides undergraduate engineering students with                   deeper insight into the nature of the effects of oscillatory                    inputs, the means of measuring them and minimizing their                        negative consequences .",
