 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments in the study of nonlinear systems have shown                that simple theoretical models are capable of extremely                         complicated dynamics that cannot be predicted over the long term                but that are nonetheless deterministic.  The dynamics of such                   systems are \"chaotic,\" rather than random.                                                                                                                      The emergence of the behavior of a social unit from the actions                 of the individuals that comprise it is one of the central                       problems in the study of behavior.  Dr. Cole is studying how the                patterns of movement activity of ant colonies are derived from                  the actions of individuals.  Individual worker ants appear to                   have chaotic activity patterns, spontaneously becoming active and               reverting to inactivity.  Colonies go through periodic episodes                 of activity about every 30 minutes.  The transition from the                    chaotic dynamics of individual workers to the periodic dynamics                 of colonies provides an opportunity to study the mechanisms by                  which a social phenotype is produced.  Furthermore, the fact that               the activity of an individual is chaotic, and therefore                         deterministic, suggests that short-term predictions can be made                 about the activity of workers.                                                                                                                                  Comparing the actual activity of ants and computer models of                    chaotic systems, Dr. Cole will study the transition from chaos to               periodicity in two situations:  first, in artificial aggregates                 of workers constructed from mature colonies, and second, during                 the pattern of normal colony growth as the colony passes from a                 single individual (the queen) to a mature colony with many                      workers.",
