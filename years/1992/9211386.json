 "awd_abstract_narration": "As individuals age and pass through different stages of life, their             responses to the world around them change in both predictable and               unpredictable ways.  These changes often involve how well, how                  rapidly, and what an individual learns.  One of the most                        challenging problems in biology is to understand how changes in                 brain structure relate to development of behavior in adults; of                 particular interest are age-related changes in behavior involving               learning and memory.  Dr. Robinson and Dr. Fahrbach will capitalize             on exciting data that indicate changes in circulating juvenile                  hormone (JH) influence both the behavioral development of worker                bees and the determination of caste.  It is known that worker bees              perform a complex series of behaviors during their short (20-42)                days of life.  Younger bees rear the next generation; middle-aged               bees maintain the hive and guard the colony; the most mature bees               forage outside of the hive for nectar and pollen.  Foraging is an               extremely demanding task involving learning and memory, and                     advanced forms of communication.  These striking changes in                     behavior are mediated by changes in juvenile hormone.  Juvenile                 hormone also causes the permanent differentiation of females into               either queens or workers.  Drs Robinson and Fahrbach are using                  these systems to define the neural pathway through which hormone                action on the brain causes transient or permanent changes in                    behavior.  They will investigate how juvenile hormone influences                neurogenesis or neural circuitry during periods in which behaviors              are changing.  In the long term, the goal to use this excellent                 model system to provide information on how learning and memory are              affected by hormones.  In addition, the honey bee is an important               insect for agriculture.  Therefore, greater understanding of the                plasticity of behavior may contribute its continual role as an                  important agricultural pollinator.",
