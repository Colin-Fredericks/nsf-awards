Designed to appeal to non-                        specialists -- the general public as well as high school and                    college students -- the film will recreate the ge of the                        Renaissance by drawing on a mixture of animation; documentary                   footage of historic sites and art; interviews with contemporary                 figures who represent the continuing influence of the                           Renaissance; and actors speaking the words of the period.                       Viewers will thus hear the words of great figures; see the                      results of their work; and be treated to re-enactments that                     evoke their lives.  Like al the films in the series, \"The                       Scientist\" will trace an important theme of the Renaissance --                  in this case, the birth of modern science -- using all aspects                  of its society and culture to convey both a sense of the past                   and a perspective on the present.  'thanks to the rich materials                of the age, and the lively confrontations it witnessed, a modern                audience will come to understand both the origins of the                        scientific outlook and -- through the interviews with                           contemporary scientists -- how it continues to shape our world.",
