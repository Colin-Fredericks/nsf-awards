 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will accomplish three objectives:  (1) development                  of innovative methods for interactive teaching and testing                      engineering students by computer; (2) development of courseware                 in Statics , a mandatory lower division course for the majority                 of engineering students); and (3) testing, modifying, and                       implementing the courseware.  Alabama A&M University at Normal,                 Alabama, and Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville are                   the project subcontractors.  They are now teaching these                        courses to a large number of students with  diverse backgrounds                 and will be participating in the development, testing, and                      dissemination of the courseware.  Five problem-solving oriented                 lessons and 5 examinations in a cT-version for stand-alone                      computers (Macintosh and PC) and a NovaNET system version, will                 present students with new problems each time the lessons are                    used.  Students will be able to work problems on their own,                     supported by continuous and appropriate feedback throughout the                 problem solving process.  Instead of multiple-choice tests,                     sophisticated constructed student responses such as algebraic                   expressions, sentences, and cursor location will be judged by                   computer. These innovative instructional materials will be                      disseminated to other engineering schools all of which teach                    the Statics course.",
