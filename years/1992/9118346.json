 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temperature is an important environmental variable that                   directly influences all levels of biological function.  In spite                of years of study, our knowledge of how temperature affects                     organisms is still sketchy, especially in terms of maximal                      behavioral capacities.  This study will be the first comprehensive              examination of how body temperature influences burst escape and                 feeding capacities in fish.  These are probably important behaviors             ensuring successful survival, growth, and reproduction in natural               populations, but we do not understand how rapid changes in                      temperature may affect these capacities.  Further, it will be the               first study to examine the plasticity of the of these behaviors                 during long term temperature exposure (acclimation).  The study                 will also begin to examine how genetic structure (ploidy level) may             influence acclimation ability, as previously hypothesized by other              workers.  This study will also examine evolutionary responses to                different temperatures in a group of fish, some taxa of which have              very narrow and others very broad thermal environments.  These                  types of information, that is, understanding of how animals respond             to acute and long term temperature exposure, in both organismal and             evolutionary time frames, is important to both fisheries management             (e.g., likely effects of water temperature on stock performance in              nature and the ability of those stocks to adjust performance over               longer term temperature exposure) and to our understanding of how               fish populations may adjust to range extension or climate change.",
