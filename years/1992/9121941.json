 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous studies of monetary policymaking have examined how the                 Federal Reserve has manipulated the supply of money or short term               interest rates in response to prevailing economic conditions.  Most             findings support the view that the Fed attempts to stabilize                    business cycle fluctuations, but there is also some evidence of                 political influences on the Fed.  For example, it is sometimes                  argued that monetary policies are sensitive to impending elections              or to partisan pressures applied by incumbent Presidents.  With                 just a few exceptions, investigators have based their analyses on               statistical relationships between variables indicative of the                   stance of monetary policy (like interest rates) and variables                   indicative of business cycle conditions (like unemployment and                  inflation rates).                                                                                                                                               This research will investigate political influences on the policy               process within the Fed.  It is important to recognize that monetary             policy decisions are made by a committee, the Federal Open Market               Committee (FOMC), not by a single individual.  The members of that              committee differ from one another in their powers, ideologies, and              political loyalties.  This project will study how members differ                from one another in their monetary policy preferences, and how they             differ in their responses to political pressures.  For example, the             researchers will investigate whether appointees of Democratic and               Republican Presidents have systematically differing policy                      preferences.  They will investigate whether pressure exerted by                 Presidents is effective, and if so, whether it is felt most keenly              by appointees of his own party.  They will also explore the special             role of the Chairman of the Fed's Board of Governors within the                 FOMC, and ask if he serves as a conduit for Presidential influence.             Answers to these questions are central to an understanding of                   monetary policy decision-making.  Moreover, since the institutional             arrangements defining FOMC procedures are subject to change through             legislation, an understanding of current institutional arrangements             is important for evaluating possible reforms.                                                                                                                   The methodology for this project is notable in several respects.                First, the investigators will employ a statistical model which                  permits them to make inferences about the policy preferences of                 particular members using both economic data and data describing                 individual FOMC member votes on policy decisions.  Second, the                  project is notable for its construction of an original data set                 based upon individuals' statements of policy preferences reported               in detailed minutes of FOMC meetings prior to 1976.  This                       compilation will yield a data set of interest to other scholars                 concerned with the history of monetary policymaking.",
