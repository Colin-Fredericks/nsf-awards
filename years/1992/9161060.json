 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes are used on a large                                                                                                   scale for the preparation of electronically active and                          insulating layers for electronic and optical solid state                        devices.  The flow, heat and mass transfer processes, and                       chemical reactions in a CVD reactor play a critical role in                                                                                                     the quality of devices formed by CVD processes.  The fluid                      dynamics in a CVD reactor is characterized by large                             temperature gradients, strong temperature dependence of the                                                                                                     gas properties, combined forced and buoyancy-induced                            convection, and homogeneous gas phase and heterogeneous                         surface reactions.  Accurate models of CVD processes can be                                                                                                     used to design new systems and decrease the number of                           exploratory experiments needed, which may be very expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                    This Phase I, Small Business Innovation Research project                        consists of the initial portion of an overall program to                        develop and validate an accurate and efficient three-                           dimensional numerical model for some common CVD reactor                         configurations.  The main features of the model will be: (1)                                                                                                    solution of the governing equations on a body-conforming grid                                                                                                   so that complex configurations can be accurately represented;                                                                                                   (2) a higher-order representation of the convection and                         diffusion terms in the transport equations; (3) an efficient                                                                                                    algorithm for the solution of the coupled discretization                        equations; (4) variable physical property formulation so that                                                                                                   the important temperature dependence can be taken into                          account; (5) ability to solve conjugate problems so that                        conduction in reactor walls can be considered without                           requiring any arbitrary boundary conditions at fluid-solid                      interfaces; (6) a realistic representation of the reactor wall                                                                                                  temperature distribution; and (7) completely flexible code                      structure so that any reaction scheme can be incorporated.                                                                                                      The end product expected will be an acurate computational                       model for flow in practical CVD reactors.",
