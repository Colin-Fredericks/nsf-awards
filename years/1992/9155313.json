 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pennsylvania State University will conduct a three-year                     project to empower 300 middle and high school mathematics                       teachers in computer-intensive environments and to prepare                      teachers for implementing computer intensive curricula in                       general and computer-intensive algebra in particular.  The                      project will engage participants through four components:  a                    computer-intensive mathematics course, a mathematics education                  course in understanding student understanding, a practicum                      involving teaches as researchers, and classroom implementation                  addressing issues in the teaching and learning of mathematics                   in computer-intensive environments.  These components will be                   accomplished through four-week intensive summer courses,                        follow-up activities during the school year, a year-long                        practicum for a subset of the teachers implementing computer-                   intensive algebra, and support for all teachers during their                    first year of implementation.  In addition, this teacher                        enhancement model will study the effects of teacher-                            implemented, task-based interviews and computer-active testing                  on their understanding of student understanding.                                                                                                                Participants will be recruited nationwide, with targeted areas                  of Washington, DC, Chicago and San Francisco.  Participants                     may elect to receive eight graduate credits.  In addition to                    the first-wave participants, an additional 900 second-wave                      participants will be effected through enactment of roles as                     computer-intensive facilitators, bringing the total numbers of                  teachers enhanced to 1200.                                                                                                                                      In working in a computer-intensive environment, participants                    will learn new teaching roles -- roles that will deemphasize                    training in routine skills and emphasize computer-based                         exploration of mathematical concepts.  They will develop new                    strategies for assessing student learning and for assigning                     grades.  Pennsylvania State and participating schools' cost-                    sharing accounts for 8% of the NSF budget.",
