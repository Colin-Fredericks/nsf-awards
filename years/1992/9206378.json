 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr.  Benz  will  investigate  two  main  themes  in  computational              astrophysics:    the  modeling  of  stellar  collisions  and the                simulation of hydrodynamical behavior in supernova explosions. He               will use a 3-D Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) computer code                to extend previous work on stellar collisions and disruptions to                include encounters involving main sequence stars of unequal mass                and compact objects.  The long range goal is to obtain cross-                   sections for merging, mass-loss and binary formation for all                    possible stellar encounters.  Knowledge of these cross-sections is              an essential ingredient for models of the evolution of globular                 cluster cores and active galactic nuclei.  The need for a better                understanding  of  hydrodynamical  instabilities  occurring  in                 supernova explosions has been demonstrated by the unexpected early              detection of x-rays from SN1987A.  Dr. Benz will also study the                 subsonic flame propagation and off-center ignition in type Ia                   supernova.                                                                                                                                                      Because SPH is a relatively new method to solve the hydrodynamical              equations, emphasis in this study is given to comparisons between               results from SPH and state-of-the-art finite difference methods.                The various tests envisioned go far beyond the usual simple shock               tube problem and will deal with complicated multidimensional flows.             This should provide a better understanding of the capabilities of               SPH at a time when this method is becoming increasingly popular.",
