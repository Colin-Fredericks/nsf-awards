 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Douglas Dorset is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                 and Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division                   and the Polymers Program in the Division of Materials Research                  to perform electron crystallography of organic and polymeric                    samples.  Dorset will extend the direct phasing methodology                     which has been widely used in X-ray crystallography to organic                  structure determination by electron crystallography.  These                     methods may be based on the probabilistic estimate of phase                     invariant sums, as in X-ray crystallography, or may also                        include phase information from high resolution electron                         microscope \"lattice images\".  Systems which have already been                   studied include small organic molecules, n-paraffins, lipid                     lamellae, linear polymers, and large fused ring systems.  The                   methodology will be extended to the investigation of other                      compounds and polymers for which no X-ray crystal structures                    exist.  If this research is successful then Dorset will have                    developed electron crystallography as a reliable method for ab                  initio structure analysis and refinement.                                       %%%                                                                             Molecular structures with atomic resolution continue to be the                  primary test bed for ab initio electronic structure theories.                   They also provide important insights on the molecular level                     interpretation of material properties.  Although X-ray crystal                  structures have been the primary source of this information,                    not all chemical compounds form large enough crystals to be                     studied by this technique.  Dr. Dorset's approach which uses                    electron diffraction is applicable to microcrystalline samples,                 and still provides vital atomic resolution information on                       chemical structures.",
