 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Composite Materials Engineering Program at Winona State                     University, the first of its kind at the undergraduate level,                   has a curriculum which includes basic and engineering sciences,                 materials science, mechanics, and design and manufacturing.                     The goal of this project is to use the laboratory work to                       provide a relationship between these elements in the                            curriculum.  Unity and coherence of subject matters are                         provided by practical experiences in materials characterization                 at various stages of study.  Characterization of materials                      enables students to understand materials properties, their                      structure and composition, their performance, and how to design                 and process them.  This understanding will enable students to                   develop and produce composite materials that perform in new and                 more effective ways for a myriad of applications.  The                          laboratory equipment consists of: ten microscopes, an                           analytical balance, two hardness testers, surface area and                      porosimetry equipment, three high temperature furnaces, a                       tabletop tensile test machine, and a data acquisition system.                   This equipment is used in laboratory and classroom instruction                  of 13 courses in the curriculum, and in the development of two                  new courses.  The equipment is also used in student design                      projects and undergraduate research.",
