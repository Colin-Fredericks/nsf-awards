 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of organometallic electrochemistry.               During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor                Geiger and his students will pursue fundamental investigations of               one-electron and two-electron transfer reactions that are designed              to elucidate mechanistic aspects of these technologically                       important types of chemical systems.  Electrochemical and                       spectroscopic techniques will be used in conjunction with well                  designed molecular frameworks containing multiple metal redox                   centers to test through-space electron delocalization, the                      cooperative reactivity of adjacent redox centers, and long                      distance interactions between weakly coupled redox centers.  Also,              a sound experimental approach will be developed for comparing the               distance dependence of homogeneous electron transfer processes                  with their heterogeneous analogues.                                             %%%                                                                             This research builds upon results obtained under Dr. Geiger's                   previous NSF grant, CHE-8603728, to provide basic insights into                 fundamental aspects of conducting materials and of photosynthetic               and other biological electron transfer reactions.  Additionally,                these studies are important to further understanding the behavior               of mixed-valent compounds that function as industrially important               catalytic systems.",
