 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the question of whether Solar variability               can affect our atmosphere through UV insolation.  Effects have been             found statistically (LBitzke and Van Loon), but we do not know if               these have physical causes or just statiscal \"quirks\".  The effect              of solar ultraviolet (uv) insolation variations on the troposphere              and stratosphere will be investigated with a General Circulation                Modedl extending from the surface to  85 km.  Solar uv variations               at wavelengths less than 0.3u will be input into the model in three             situations: the model control run (which has light cast tropical                winds in the lower stratosphere) and the two phases of the QBO                  (strong east winds and strong west winds).  The model simulations               for the control, QBO experiments and increased uv experiments will              each be run for three years, in an attempt to separate the solar                impact from the interannual variability.  The uv increase first                 utilized will be large (50%) to clarify the nature of potential                 responses.  Future experiments will reduce the increase to 10%, and             may alter the spectrum of the increase, so that a greater                       percentage of the change is at the shortest wavelengths.                        The goal of these experiments is to investgate and understand the               potential impact solar cycle variations may have on the troposphere             and stratosphere.  The stratosphere is most likely to be directly               affected, and the method of any potential interaction with the                  troposphere will be closely  examined.  Possible tropospheric                   impacts of interest include variations in jet stream, storm track               and the general synoptic climatology, all of which have been                    reported in the literature but whose mechanism has yet to be                    identified.  Successful simulation of such responses, if they                   occur, will help validate the observations, as well as the ability              of coupled troposphere/stratosphere models to simulate the                      dynamical interactions between these two regions.",
