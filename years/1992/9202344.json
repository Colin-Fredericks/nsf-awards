 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns scattering theory and, in particular,               the study of scattering poles or resonances and nonlinear                       diffraction.  The resonances which in a wide range of situations                appear as the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the                      resolvent of the operator constitute, in some sense, are the                    replacement of the discrete spectral data for problems on                       noncompact domains.  As in the case of eigenvalues, the link                    between the distribution of these poles and the dynamical                       properties of the scatterer is of great interest.  Also, this                   project supports the study of the regularity of nonlinear waves on              domains with diffractive boundaries which represents a natural                  continuation of the well understood linear theory.  The main                    concern is an accurate description of the location of the                       'anomalous' singularities due to nonlinear interaction.  Finally,               this project will involve a study of operators arising in solid                 state physics.  This topic is concerned with the spectral theory                rather than the scattering theory but it shares the microlocal                  aspects of the scattering theory.                                                    This research, in the general area of geometry, involves the               behavior of waves and wave fronts together with the spectral                    problems motivated by solid-state physics and noncommutative                    geometry.",
