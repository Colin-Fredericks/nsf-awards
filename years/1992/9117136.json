 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research has demonstrated that the nebulosity surrounding                the familiar Pleiades star cluster results from an accidental                   encounter between the cluster and an interstellar cloud.  Data from             the Infrared Astronomical Satellite have revealed the wake of the               Pleiades in the ambient interstellar medium, and have indicated the             existence of a bow shock where heated gas near the cluster                      compresses the upstream material.  Dr. White's research has the                 following aims: to trace the motions of the interstellar gas                    observed toward the Pleiades, particularly in the cluster-cloud                 interaction region; to explore the physical conditions that prevail             in the gas and infer the spatial relationships among the stars and              the nearby gas; to characterize interstellar processes in the                   cluster, particularly the dominant process of gas heating by                    photoelectrons emitted from dust grains and the poorly understood               formation process of the CH+ molecule.  The means to these ends                 will be analysis of interstellar absorption lines in high                       resolution, high sensitivity spectra of cluster and background                  stars to be obtained at Kitt Peak National Observatory.  This award             is made under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)                  program.",
