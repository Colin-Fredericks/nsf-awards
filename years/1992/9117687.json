 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Global Sedimentary Geology Program (GSGP) , established                as a Commission of the International Union of Geological Sciences,              is now initiating its second research project dealing with a study              of the global sedimentary record of PANGEA, a supercontinent which              existed during a time interval ranging from the base of the                     Pennsylvanian (Middle  Carboniferous) through the early Jurassic.               This time interval offers special opportunities to understand                   global processes and both their magnitude and temporal variations               during a time of accretion, zenith and breakup of a major                       supercontinent.  Its sediments preserve evidence of a broad range               of climatic changes including glacial to desert.  Milankovitch                  rhythms, development and demise of carbonate platforms and reefs,               evaporites, and phosphorites, and includes two major extinction                 events at the boundaries between the Permian and Triassic and the               Triassic and Jurassic.  Its deposits include large quantities of                natural resources including petroleum, salt, phosphorites and coal.                  To implement this new project, an integrated workshop                      involving five working groups, is planned in Lawrence, Kansas,                  between May 24 and May 29, 1992.  Each of the working Groups are                based with Project PANGEA and include (1) Paleogeography,                       Paleoclimatic modelling and Plate Tectonics, (2) Global Sedimentary             Record, (3) Global Synchroniety and Stratigraphic Constraints, (4)              Resources, and (5) Synthesis.  A general summary will close the                 workshop to provide overall project coordination.                                    A U.S. National Group for Project PANGEA was established also.             This working group has the dual responsibility of coordinating the              U.S. research effort and insure adequate participation of U. S.                 Scientists.  On behalf of this U .S. National Working Group, this               proposal is made for funding to support the travel of key U.S.                  personnel to the planned workshop in Lawrence Kansas, as well as                funding for U.S. based Keynote speakers, and five scientist from                the USSR, People's Republic of China and Eastern Europe.",
