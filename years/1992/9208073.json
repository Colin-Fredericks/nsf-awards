 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will continue to study the relationship                   between the curvature and the topology of manifolds.  In                        particular, he will continue to study the existence and concordance             classification of positive scalar curvature metrics.  He has                    recently shown that if a closed manifold M admits a positive scalar             curvature metric, then the concordance classes of such metrics are              in bijective correspondence to a certain bordism group which                    depends only on the fundamental group and the first two Stiefel-                Whitney classes of M.  Also, M admits a positive scalar curvature               metric if and only if M represents zero in this bordism group.  If              the universal cover of M is spin, this bordism group maps to the                real K-theory of the 'twisted' group C*-algebra of the fundamental              group of M, the twist being determined by the first two Stiefel-                Whitney classes of M.  An optimistic hope is that this is in fact               an isomorphism.  The investigator intends to continue his study of              the relations between positive Ricci curvature, elliptic genera and             elliptic homology; in particular, to pursue his conjecture that the             Witten genus of a positive Ricci curvature manifold M vanishes                  provided M is spin and its first Pontrjagin class is zero.  In a                different direction, he hopes to show that all the possible                     multiplicities of a Dupin hypersurface with four distinct                       eigenvalues are realized by the known examples, i.e. the                        homogeneous examples and the Clifford examples.                                      Topology treats those properties of geometric objects which                are not dependent upon distances or angles, which are so                        fundamental that they persist after stretching and bending an                   object short of tearing it.  In a topological sense, a phonograph               record and a wedding ring are the same, for no topological                      properties distinguish one from the other.  In fact, each is                    topologically the same as a coffee cup.  Their shapes are wildly                different, and yet there are some geometric properties that all                 will have in common as a result of their common topology.  The                  famous Gauss-Bonnet theorem, well-known in electromagnetic theory               as well as differential geometry, requires that the total                       (Gaussian) curvature of any of their surfaces will be zero.  Now                curvature is a very non-topological property, and locally it can                have any value whatsoever on one of these surfaces, but the values              cannot be totally unrelated as one moves from point to point, for               the theorem says they will all sum to zero if one weights them by               elements of area.  Prominent among the results this project seeks               are modern variants of this wonderful theorem for manifolds of                  other dimensions and for other kinds of curvature.",
