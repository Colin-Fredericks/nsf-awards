 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plans to reduce the number of military personnel by 25% have                    stimulated public interest in the social representativeness for                 the U.S. military and in the effects of voluntary military                      service on civilian labor market outcomes.   The military is the                largest single employer of young people and veterans benefits                   constitute the largest federal subsidy to education and training.               The purpose of this project is to analyze the impact of military                service on the earnings of veterans after leaving the military.                 What is at issue is whether or not military service, on average,                has a positive or negative effect on success in the civilian                    labor market.                                                                                                                                                   Errors in the scoring of military entrance examinations in the                  late 1970's increased the probability that low ability applicants               would be accepted.  This exogenous shift in acceptance                          probabilities provides a natural experiment that can be used to                 estimate the effects of voluntary, military service on civilian                 labor-market outcomes.  The effects of military entrance                        standards on the social composition of the armed forces will also               be analyzed.  The empirical strategy is to match armed forces                   administrative records on military applicants to military records               on entrants, and finally to longitudinal social-security earnings               records.  The matched data set will consist of a long panel                     containing information on earnings, test scores, veteran status,                and demographic characteristics.  Semi-parametric estimators will               be developed for estimating the effects of military service in                  nonlinear models with unobserved individual effects.",
