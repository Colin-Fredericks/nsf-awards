Deborah Pearsall and Dolores Piperno will collaborate on a                 project to develop the application of phytolith analysis to                     archaeological materials.  Phytoliths are small bodies of silica                which are deposited within plants and are usually preserved in                  soil after death and decomposition occurs.  Although one species                of plant may produce phytoliths of many shapes, and very few                    shapes are restricted to a single species, it is possible to                    examine phytolith assemblages and make some species                             identifications.                                                                                                                                                The research team will concentrate on corn and related species.                 They will obtain phytoliths from different vegetative parts of                  both domestic corn and possible confusing species to determine                  what features are unique to corn phytoliths.  they will also                    develop an expert system to permit accurate and easy                            identification.                                                                                                                                                 Only under the most unusual conditions are plants remains                       preserved in archaeological sites.  Thus, because plants play                   such an important dietary role, it is extremely difficult to                    reconstruct prehistoric diets.  In tropical areas of the work,                  where preservation is extremely poor, this problem is                           particularly acute.  Phytoliths, because they are so durable,                   provide a potential way around this problem  and therefore merit                attention.  However, because of the lack of one to one                          correspondence between phytolith species, analysis poses                        difficulties.  This research should help to solve this problem.                                                                                                 The project is important because it will provide archaeologists,                as well as paleobiologists, with a value tool which should be                   useful in many parts of the world.",
