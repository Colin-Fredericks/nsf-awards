 "awd_abstract_narration": "In ca. AD 600, a catastrophic eruption by the Laguna Caldera                    volcano in El Salvador completely buried a Mayan homestead and                  the fields which surrounded it.  Preliminary excavations at this                site of Ceren in 1978 indicated that the volcanic ash packed                    around and thoroughly preserved structures, wooden artifacts,                   trees, corn plants, a field with footprints, and human bodies.                  Subsequent geophysical prospection in 1979 confirmed the                        existence of intact houses which remain buried under five meters                of ash.  NSF funded research in 1989 and 1990 revealed extremely                well preserved remains.  Dr. Sheets and his colleagues will                     return to this site and continue their extensive excavation which               will focus on a single structure and surrounding environment.                   Floral and faunal materials will be recovered and analyzed to                   reconstruct household subsistence, and expected skeletal                        materials will provide insight into family composition.  Field                  excavation will allow reconstruction of agricultural techniques.                                                                                                Ceren is unique, even in comparison to Old World sites such as                  Pompeii, because the volcanic ash matrix is so fine that it                     preserves organic materials down to the cellular level.  This                   virtually complete material culture record will allow for a                     detailed reconstruction of functioning households and important                 insights to human behavior, demography, nutrition, agriculture,                 and economics.  Anthropologists have come to realize that in many               societies the \"household\" - a group of individuals who live                     together in one place and closely cooperate on a daily basis-                   form an essential unit.  However, archaeologically households are               usually difficult to isolate and study.  At Ceren it appears that               just such a unit exists.                                                                                                                                        This research is important because it will shed a new and                       important light on the development of complex Mayan society and                 help us to understand how complexity develops and is maintained.",
