 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general objective of the proposed research is to determine the              limits of performance during non-steady state, intermittent                     activity in order to reveal general principles of organismal                    design. Our objective will be accomplished by exploiting the                    enormous variation in the way animals are built for legged                      terrestrial locomotion. Energy, oxygen transport and musculo-                   skeletal systems have been well studied during steady-state,                    constant speed locomotion, but these systems must also function                 under non-steady state, transient conditions. We propose to test                whether or not performance limits established under steady-state                exercise is conducted intermittently. We will determine the extent              to which endurance during intermittent locomotion in arthropods is              dependent on exercise period duration, pause period duration, the               ratio of exercise to pause duration, and the speed during the                   exercise period. We will also test whether or not the cost of                   intermittent locomotion, both per time and per distance, is more                expensive than continuous locomotion at the same average speed when             both aerobic and anaerobic sources are considered. Finally, we will             determine the physiological correlates of intermittent exercise                 performance. We will both measure and model correlates of fatigue               causing agents  that accumulate during exercise periods, but are                removed, reduced or cleared during the pause periods and fatigue                causing agents that accumulate during the pause periods. The                    proposed research on intermittent locomotion attempts to advance                the previous paradigm based on steady-state locomotion and takes                the next step logical to the development of a general theory of                 activity.",
