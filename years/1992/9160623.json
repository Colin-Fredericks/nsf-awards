 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advent of microcomputer and electronic displays is changing                 the nature of everyday tasks.  Many types of display make higher                demands on switching back and forth between displays than on                    sustained inspection of a single display.  There is evidence that               temporal acuity describes a capability advantage for the new task               demands.  The availability of portable microcomputers,                          particularly battery-operated versions with rapid onset visual                  elements, may permit the assessment of these abilities.  This                   research will determine whether a trait exists involving temporal               acuity factors in perception.  To do this, the research will                    implement paradigms dealing with theoretically disparate aspects                of temporal as opposed to spatial factors, from various domains                 and conceptual models (viz., information processing, perception,                and cognition) on such a portable microcomputer.  The research                  will use for empirical studies methodologies that follow from                   mental test theory.  The research will involve administration of                a number of tasks to groups of individuals over several                         replications to determine:  (1) the degree of stability and                     reliability of each test, (2) the number of unique factors                      evaluated by such tests, and (3) the relationship of any \"new\"                  factors to other \"old\" capabilities presently measurable and                    predictive of operational performance (e.g., scores on                          intelligence tests or tests of spatial perception).   Phase II                  research will validate the factors which surfaced in Phase I                    against real-world performances of military persons, to determine               predictive validity and variance accounted for, and permit                      generalization and unequivocal evaluation of the test properties.                                                                                               An off-the-shelf portable battery of temporal factors which                     stabilize rapidly will have important applications to selection.                The results would further specify constructs which appear in                    theory to be related to a myriad of jobs.  The traditional                      methods of testing can be improved to take into account abilities               in speed of processing.",
