 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar plasma energetics is a subject which has applications not                 only to astronomers but also to practical applications for nuclear              fusion containment (tokamaks) and the disruption of the Earth's                 magneto-sphere and radio communications.  In a previous award the               Principal Investigator (PI) has combined simultaneous observations              from x-ray satellites and the ground observatory in Hawaii to                   follow the development of solar flares at high time resolution.                 His results show for the first time that momentum is conserved in               flare plasma (gas), a conclusion which puts significance                        constraints on models of flare development in the solar chromo-                 sphere and lower corona.  The new award is an Accomplishment Based              Renewal Award based on the long-term excellent record of his group.             The new work will extend his work to a number of new areas,                     including new spectral lines carrying separate information and                  observations of active solar-type stars.  The latter group is                   designed to determine whether the extent to  which certain                      processes responsible for solar flare production are at play in                 these stars, thus advancing the place of solar flare physics in                 the research area known as the \"solar-stellar connection.\"",
