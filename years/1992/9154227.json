Participants in this four-week                 long, summer workshop carry out up to four experiments based on                 seven recent Nobel prizes:  1987 Nobel Prize for High                           Temperature Superconductivity; 1986 Nobel Prize for the                         Scanning Tunneling Microscope; 1983 Nobel Prize for Nuclear                     Reactions and Nucleo-synthesis; the 1981 Nobel Prizes for                       Electron Spectroscopy, Non-Linear Optics, and Laser                             Spectroscopy; and the 1977 Nobel Prize for the Quantum Nature                   of Solids.  The \"Nobel\" Workshop offers participants \"hands-on\"                 laboratory experience using up-to-date instrumentation                          purchased with a recent ILI Grant from NSF.  Participants                       interact daily with local and national experts in the various                   topic areas of Modern Physics, and work to develop                              instructional materials for teaching the physics concepts to                    science students.  Continued contact with the participants will                 be maintained through a newsletter and electronic mail.  The                    intellectual stimulation and personal involvement experienced                   by the participants help them to relay the excitement of                        science to students at their home institutions.",
