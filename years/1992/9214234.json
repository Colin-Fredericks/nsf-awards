 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was the first                  \"presidential initiative\" in science under the administration of                President George Bush.  It began early in 1989.  As the first                   such initiative it has pioneered institutionally.  In 1993, the                 the Global Change Program involves eleven different agencies and                about $1.3 billion in support of research and related activities.               The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has played a                         leadership role in the USGCRP.  This pilot project will develop                 the theoretical and methodological tools to examine the                         development of this program.  The pilot will allow the principal                investigator to conduct a reconnaissance to determine who were                  the key actors in the interaction of federal agencies with each                 other and, possibly, with relevant parties in other countries, in               the development of this new program.  It will allow him to                      identify major projects sponsored under the program and criteria                by which to select some for further study.  The pilot will use                  actor-network theory to consider how NSF has worked with others                 to construct and maintain a coalition of diverse support behind                 this program.  Findings will advance knowledge concerning the                   federal role in the social construction of science by linking                   actor-network theory with an important issue in science policy                  and by considering whether and how accountability for \"good                     science\" and for \"policy relevance\" can be reconciled.",
