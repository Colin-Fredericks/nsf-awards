 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                   anthropologist studying the struggle of a dependent, Caribbean                  society to define its identity with respect to the dominant                     European society.  The research will take place on Martinique, a                \"department\" of the French nation.  Using participant                           observation, interviewing of government officials, and studying                 popular culture, the student will try to understand how local                   Martinique bureaucrats in charge of cultural affairs define their               cultural life with respect to the hegemony of France, and how                   ordinary people deal with the issue of their \"own\" nationalism                  and their status as French colonial citizens.                                                                                                                   This research is important because the problem of national                      identity is critical for ex-colonial nations in the third world.                This case study of public officials and plain citizens deals with               the problems of establishing a positive identity with respect to                the dominant Western ex-colonial power.  It can help us                         understand similar situations in other geographic regions.  With                the breakdown of the USSR empire local cultural conflicts will                  increase in importance, and any increase in our understanding of                the sources of conflicts about cultural identity can help                       decision makers deal with them.",
