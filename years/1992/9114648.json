Wehinger, Susan                                   Wyckoff, and their graduate student, Marvin                                     Kleine, will visit their Australian                                             counterpart, Dr. Bruce A. Peterson of the                                       Australian National University, once in each of                                 three years.  The goals of this research are to                                 determine the carbon isotope abundance ratio in                                 a sample of bright comets, and to determine the                                 12C/13C abundance ratio in the local                                            interstellar medium by observing absorption                                     lines of molecules and molecular ions (CN, CH,                                  and CH+) in the lines-of-sight of bright 0- and                                 B-type stars.                                                                                                                                                   Also proposed is the development of a full                                      fluorescence model for CN to improve the                                        accuracy with which we can determine the carbon                                 and nitrogen isotope ratios in comets.  The                                     researchers will use the Mount Stromolo                                         Observatory's 1.9 meter telescope located near                                  Canberra, Australia, with its coude-echelle                                     spectrograph and photo-counting array.  In the                                  Northern Hemisphere, the investigators will use                                 the Kitt Peak National Observatory coude-feed                                   telescope and echelle spectrograph.                                                                                                                             The research, which is essentially a                                            continuation of a successful collaborative                                      effort begun with Comet Halley in 1986 with                                     U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program                                      support, is important because of what it may                                    reveal about the formation of the early                                         universe.  Additional financial support for the                                 domestic U.S. research comes from NASA and NSF                                  grants.",
