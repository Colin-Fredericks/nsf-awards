 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inorganic phosphate and ATP are involved in more chemical reactions             on the earth's surface than any other compound except water.                    Phosphate entry into eukaryotic cells and into their organelles is              catalyzed by at least two distinct types of transport system, one,              a Na+/P transporter and the other a H+/P transporter.  Past work                supported by NSF resulted in the identification of the H+/P                     transporter as a 32-35 kDa protein, its purification,                           reconstitution, cloning, sequencing, expression in E. coli, and                 import into isolated mitochondria.  Future Specific Aims during the             grant period are 6-fold and will be to.                                         %%%                                                                             Establish whether the functional form of the H+/Pi transporter                  in its native membrane environment is a monomer or a higher ordered             oligomer.  Express functionally the full length cDNA of the                     H+/Pi transporter and verify its membrane topology.  Introduce                  both site directed and random mutations in the functionally                     expressed transporter in order to identify candidate amino acids                involved in transport. Initiate studies which may prove                         valuable in supplying 3-Dimensional structural information about                the H+/Pi transporter.  Determine to what extent homologous                     H+/Pi transporters are expressed in plant and animal cells. Compare             the regulatory events involved in the expression of H+/Pi                       transporter Gene(s) in plant and animal cells.",
