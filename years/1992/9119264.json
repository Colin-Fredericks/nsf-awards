 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the mechanism, at the molecular level,               underlying the secretion of milk-fat droplets from mammary                      epithelial cells during lactation.  Fat droplets assembled in the               cytoplasm are released from the surface of secretory cells coated               with an outer layer of membrane.  This layer gives rise to the fat-             globule membrane (FGM) on the surface of fat droplets in milk.  The             proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that butyrophilin,                the major protein of FGM, functions as a specific receptor for                  cytoplasmic fat droplets, and that the budding of fat droplets from             the apical surface occurs through the progressive cross-linking of              butyrophilin molecules to each other and to other FGM proteins via              disulfide bonds.  It will be determined if butyrophilin is enriched             in the FGM relative to the apical plasma membrane and becomes                   cross-linked by disulfide bonds in the cytoplasmic domain during                formation of FGM.  The butyrophilin gene will be inserted into                  cells in culture, and into mice, to see whether butyrophilin                    associates with fat droplets in cells other than mammary secretory              cells.  Butyrophilin gene expression will be eliminated in                      transgenic mice to test whether milk-fat secretion is inhibited in              lactating animals.                                                              %%%                                                                             Exocrine secretion (cellular secretion which proceeds via                       exocytosis of secretory content) has become an extremely well                   studied aspect of cell biology, and tremendous breakthroughs in our             understanding of exocytotic secretion have been and continue to                 take place.  In contrast, apocrine secretion (secretion which                   proceeds by the \"budding off\" of apical cytoplasmic content), as                typified by milk fat globule secretion, has received relatively                 little attention in recent years.  This proposal promises to                    increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in              milk fat secretion.  In addition to contributing to fundamental                 knowledge of cellular processes, a better understanding of milk fat             secretion will have great significance for potential                            biotechnological applications, such as the use of transgenic bovine             milk as a source of commercially useful membrane proteins.",
