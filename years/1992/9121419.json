 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the design of a new                         Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) and the development of              its application to various classes of problems arising in                       production, location-allocation, economics, and various engineering             and systems design and operational contexts.  At the heart of this              methodology is a procedure developed under a previous National                  Science Foundation project for generating tight, higher                         dimensional, linear programming representations for linear and                  polynomial zero-one mixed-integer programming problems.  The basic              RLT procedure possesses a considerable degree flexibility that can              be exploited to develop effective algorithmic variants.  Various                transformations and implementation schemes will be investigated in              order to enhance the capability in solving both discrete and                    continuous nonconvex decision problems.  The utility of the RLT                 scheme in generating facets and tight valid inequalities for                    important discrete classes of problems will also be explored.  This             will benefit other algorithms for mixed-integer zero-one problems.                   The methodology developed will be specialized to solve                     indefinite and concave quadratic programs, linear complementarily               problems, location-allocation problems, and fixed-charge problems               that arise in the different aforementioned applications.",
