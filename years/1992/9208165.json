 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research effort, the effects of pipelining on the                       performance of a high speed synchronous digital system are                      investigated.  Pipelining, coupled with the design of the clock                 distribution network synchronizing the signal flow between each                 data path, can significantly effect system performance.  Timing                 characteristics of the clock distribution network are analyzed in               terms of how system performance can be either enhanced or degraded.             A graphical design paradigm relating latency and clock frequency                as a function of the level of pipelining are enhanced to further                study the performance of a synchronous system.                                                                                                                  Specifically, the following areas are investigated: 1) the                      application of localized clock waveform lead/lag relationships to               pipelined data paths so as to demonstrate the utility of these                  relationships and to understand their limitations for increasing                clock frequency in deeply pipelined systems, 2) the investigation               of the effects of retiming and register allocation/scheduling on                pipelined systems for application to behavioral synthesis and                   analysis, 3) the application of the aforementioned graphical                    approach to the analysis of clock frequency/latency tradeoffs in                structures containing feedback, thereby providing a structured                  theoretical basis for designing and implementing recursive circuit              structures, and 4) the investigation of the effects of process                  parameter variations on system level performance.",
