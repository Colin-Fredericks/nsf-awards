The field has evolved dramatically in the ten                 years since the 1981 report, \"Polymer Science and Engineering:                  Challenges, Needs and Opportunities.\"  There is a clear need to                 define the current research frontiers, the matching research needs              and opportunities for chemists, chemical engineers, biologists,                 materials scientists, and the corresponding funding priorities that             will be essential for planning and decisions by funding agencies.               The proposed study will be carried out by a committee of 15 experts             established by the Board.  It is estimated that the study will take             12 months to complete at a cost of $200,000 of which $75,000 is                 being provided by the National Science Foundation.  The National                Science Foundation Divisions participating are the Division of                  Materials Research, Division of Molecular Biosciences, Division of              Chemical and Thermal Systems, and the Division of Chemistry.",
