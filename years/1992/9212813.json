 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project documents the history of laws and policies concerning              immigration to colonial America.  It locates this history in its                broad global context, advancing the general notion that immigration             involves not only the interests and goals of the receiving nation,              but also those of the sending countries, and the complex interplay              between receiving and sending nations.  Specifically, the project               catalogs significant restrictions on immigration to North America               in the colonial period of 1607 to 1763.  It demonstrates that these             restrictions were not simply local phenomena, but are the result                of serious policy disputes between the metropolitan center of the               British Empire and its colonial periphery.                                                                                                                      To document this history and advance the thesis that early                      immigration laws are a by-product of tensions between the center                and the periphery, the investigator uses a combination of statutory             research and historical methods, including the full record of                   primary and secondary sources located in the U.S. and abroad. In                addition to filling an important gap in knowledge about the early               foundations of U.S. immigration law, it contributes to the broader              theme that law formation may be studied as a dynamic between                    domestic/local interests and goals on the one hand, and external                attempts to impose or transplant interests and goals on the other.",
