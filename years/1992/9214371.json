Research projects which will depend on                      this equipment are in the areas of biochemistry and                             biotechnology.  More specifically the instrument will be                        used in the research goals of ten projects described in this                    application to:   (a) provide molecular weights of proteins,                    (b) sequence N-terminally blocked or modified proteins, (c)                     determine the sites and structures of carbohydrates on                          glycoproteins, (d) determine the sites of alkylation                            reactions on protein, (e) locate the receptor sites in the                      enzyme of a substrate-enzyme complex (f) determine the sites                    of linkage of protein-DNA covalent units (g) determine the                      disulfide linkages of several proteins, and (h) determine                       the structures of elecitors in aphid resistant hop plants.                      These projects cannot be efficiently or even successfully                       completed without the instrument for which funds are being                      requested.  The present mass spectrometers available for                        these projects, which includes a Krotos MS 50TC-RF                              instrument, lack  the sensitivity, mass range and tandem                        mass spectrometry capability to do the necessary sequencing                     and structure analyses.  The increasing emphasis of                             biochemical and biotechnology research and the recent                           addition of new faculty in these areas on the Oregon State                      University campus, has created a growing need for this                          equipment.",
