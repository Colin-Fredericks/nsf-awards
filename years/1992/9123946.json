 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator, in collaboration with Dr. M. M. Vishik of                University of Chicago, will continue to investigate topics in                   fluid dynamics.  She uses inverse scattering techniques to obtain               solutions to the Euler equations that govern the flow of an                     incompressible, inviscid fluid.  This work follows from a Lax                   pair formulation for the Euler equations derived by the                         investigator and Vishik.  She also proposes to apply dynamo                     theory techniques to extend the applicability of the instability                criteria that she and Vishik have recently obtained for the                     linearized fluid equations.  The investigator will continue her                 examination, via the use of Hamiltonian techniques, of the                      stability/instability of three dimensional axisymmetric                         magnetohydrodynamic equilibria.                                                      The primary subject of this research concerns criteria for                 the existence of instabilities (i.e., when a small change in a                  steady configuration becomes larger and larger with time.)  Fluid               instabilities are crucial factors in determining the behavior of                many important physical systems.  For example, the so called                    baroclinic instability governs the large scale circulation of the               atmosphere; convective instabilities play an important role in                  air-sea interaction with implications for possible global                       warming; magnetohydrodynamic instabilities underlie the                         phenomenon of plasma fusion; the existence of terrestrial and                   solar magnetic fields is dependent on dynamo instabilities.  The                investigator's mathematical analysis of the equations of fluid                  motion has led to specific criteria governing the existence of                  certain types of instabilities and her proposed research will                   continue to advance our understanding of the behavior of                        geophysical and astrophysical fluids.",
