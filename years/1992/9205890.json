These evaluations are predicted to occur when critical attributes               of a social stimulus that control judgment (e.g., stimatizing                   attibutes such as gender, race, SES) are not at the respondent's                focus of attention.  In Part 1, a procedure will be used in which               the attribute of fame is incorrectly assigned as a result of a                  bias in memory caused by perceptual familiarity.  This procedure                is used to identify that equal familiarity with male and female                 names results in a higher probability of assigning false fame to                male than female names.  Variations of this procedure will be                   used to identify the unconscious nature and limiting conditions                 of this bias, Part 2 will establish the generality of this                      phenononmenon to another social category, by using names that                   vary in perceived race and ethnicity, and judgments such as                     criminal and politician.  Part 3 will present a method to study                 implicit attitudes, and attempts to conceptually differentiate                  the (cognitive) stereotype construct from the (affective)                       attitude construct.  This research is designed to examine whether               discrimination can be controlled by implicit stereotypes even in                the presence of positive implicit attitudes.  Together, the                     3-part program of research seeks to demonstrate the value of                    implicit measures of stereotyping and prejudice, to provide                     understanding of the subtle yet powerful information processing                 mechanisms by which biases in evaluation are produced, and to                   question the currently dominant conception that such evaluations                operate primarily within consciousness.",
