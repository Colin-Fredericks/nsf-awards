 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aphids are small syringe-like insects which penetrate plants and                suck up plant juices for nutrients.  Acting like unsterilized                   needles these insects transmit a variety of agriculturally                      important plant diseases.  Within the body cavity of aphids are                 specialized cells which contain gram-negative bacteria                          (endosymbionts) which cannot be cultured outside the host cells.                The aphid is dependent on the endosymbionts,  their elimination by              treatment with antibiotics results in sterility or death of the                 host.  Plant sap is deficient in a variety of amino acids which                 insects cannot synthesize and evidence suggests that the                        endosymbionts supply these amino acids for the aphid host.  Perhaps             the best available evidence is for the overproduction of tryptophan             by the endosymbiont;  there is also evidence that some                          endosymbionts may overproduce cysteine.  Our study involves the                 cloning and sequencing of genes coding for enzymes of tryptophan                and cysteine biosynthesis,  the overproduction of selected key                  enzymes and a study of their kinetic properties.  These results may             indicate that the two key amino acids,  tryptophan and cysteine are             overproduced by the endosymbiont and utilized by the aphid host.                This information will establish a function for the endosymbiont and             may suggest approaches for the controlling of aphid pests by the                elimination of their endosymbionts.",
