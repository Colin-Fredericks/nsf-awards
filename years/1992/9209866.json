 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid prototyping of systems with unconstrained design spaces               is limited by the present need to effectively re-develop all                    aspects of a new system.  The work here is the first step towards               reusability of subsystems and the capability to achieve such                    reusability from a variety of CAD platforms and for a variety of                implementation technologies.  There are several challenges to be                met in achieving the stated goal of subsystem reusability.  The                 foremost challenge is the need to maintain consistent and                       documented representations of the various modules at various levels             of design such as printed circuit boards, netlists, functional                  models, behavioral models, or design specifications.  Moreover, any             useful solution must be applicable to various CAD tools and                     environments and not limited to one choice.  The research here                  consists of three phases:  the study of representation models and               how consistency can be maintained across various representations,               the development of subsystems according to the representation                   models developed in the first phase, and the rapid development of               a variety of systems with the new approach.  Existing CAD tools for             system design are used extensively, and new tools are developed                 largely to drive existing tools rather than replace them.",
