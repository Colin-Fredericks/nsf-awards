 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project sponsored by the Experimental Physical                          Chemistry Program, Professor George Ewing of Indiana University                 will use infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy to map patterns                 of energy flow for small molecules weakly adsorbed on single                    crystal insulator surfaces. This includes developing techniques                 for growing well-ordered monolayers on well-defined surfaces,                   and studies of two dimensional phase transitions as well as                     obtaining rates of vibrational dephasing, radiation, phonon                     excitation, and photodetachment. The work is important because                  it illustrates differences between insulator surfaces which                     bind intact molecules weakly, and more commonly studied                         conducting (metallic) surfaces which involve much stronger                      atom-surface interactions.                                                      %%%                                                                             Molecules bound to metal surfaces are often destroyed by the                    strong bonding forces. By focussing attention on molecules                      bound to insulators, Professor Ewing (Indiana University) is                    able to learn how energy flows between a surface and intact,                    weakly bound molecules. This provides a unique glimpse into the                 chemistry of fundamental processes involved in friction and                     lubrication.",
