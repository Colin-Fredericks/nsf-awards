 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of an                           anthropology student from the University of Michigan.  The                      project is to study the effects of wage labor by junior males on                patterns of authority and conflict among the pastoral Samburu of                Kenya.  It will address issues concerning how authority is                      structured in households in traditional societies where the                     economic basis of income is changing from a traditional pastoral                to a wage labor economy.  Both quantitative survey methods and                  qualitative methods of interviews and participant observation                   will be used.                                                                                                                                                   This research is important because patterns of authority have                   been changing in traditional societies in response to changes in                income opportunities.  Increased understanding of the household                 dynamics of these changes can help planners accommodate the                     problems which such shifts in authority entail.",
