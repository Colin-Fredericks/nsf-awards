Go Power is                   being created as part of a U.S. Department of Energy exhibition                 initiative with in-kind support from the Lower Colorado River                   Authority, a non-profit public power agency, and design and                     fabrication assistance by the Robot Group, an Austin-based                      consortium of engineers and artists.  The partnership, advised                  by a panel of science, energy, and education experts, will build                a 1,200 square-foot exhibit geared towards young children (pre-                 school and elementary-age), and their families.  An Exhibit                     Developer with a strong scientific background will be                           responsible for the design and implementation of exhibit                        components which will highlight energy-related science and                      technology as a focus for developing and utilizing skills of                    scientific inquiry and invention.  Through kinetic sculpture,                   computer games, participatory exhibits, and adjunct programming,                visitors will learn about potential and kinetic energy and its                  forms:  mechanical, electrical, chemical, thermal, solar.                       Following its test edition, designed with input from advisors,                  front-end evaluations, and prototypes, Go Power will become the                 sixth exhibit to join the Museum's popular national touring                     program.",
