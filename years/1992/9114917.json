 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now well understood that the outbursts of \"novae\" are caused              by the dumping of hydrogen-rich material from a binary companion                onto a white dwarf and the detonation of this material by fusion                reactions in the hot crusts of white dwarfs.  However, the details              of this process and the events leading up to the explosion are not              well understood.  For example, they rely on a set of unknowns                   affecting the evolution of close binary stars and the hydrody-                  namical evolution of the shock wave as it emanates from the star.               The Principal Investigator (PI) will renew his study of these                   processes for three years.  The projects to be focused during                   the grant period are the dumping of material onto magnetized                    white dwarfs, an understanding of the mechanisms required for                   the synthesis of medium-mass nuclei, the cause of the cessation                 of the nova outburst, and a study of the recurrence phenomenon                  in one subclass of novae.  This work is expected to complement                  the work on explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae, as it is                   now apparent that heavy nuclei must have been produced in a                     variety of sites in the early history of our Galaxy.",
