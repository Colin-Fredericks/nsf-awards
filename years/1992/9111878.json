 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the conceptual formulation, design,                       fabrication, and testing of a wave-driven artificial upwelling                  device that can draw nutrient-rich deep ocean water (DOW) to the                ocean surface as a precursor to commercially-viable, open-ocean                 mariculture.  The device will ba a 1:20 scale model of the                      prototype that will eventually be constructed and deployed in the               open ocean in subsequent research and development efforts.  This                project is part of a larger research effort of the University of                Hawaii, the ultimate goal of which is to develop the technology                 for open ocean mariculture.                                                                                                                                     The research task of this project will be conducted in three                    phases.  The first phase includes the design of hydraulic                       experiments and the construction of the hydraulic model.  A                     laboratory-scale, wave-driven artificial upwelling device will be               designed and fabricated at the University of Hawaii's Look                      Laboratory.  Wave energy conversion theories will be examined,                  and modifications of existing formulas may be made to make them                 compatible with the special physical environment conditions                     related to artificial upwelling.  A series of hydraulic modeling                experiments will then be designed based on theoretical derivation               to investigate the upwelling depths and flow rates as functions                 of various design parameters.                                                                                                                                   The second phase covers the actual hydraulic modeling                           experiments.  In this phase, the calibration of the hydraulic                   model and instrumentation will first be conducted to test the                   hydrodynamic performance of the device and make necessary                       modifications to the original design.                                                                                                                           The final phase is the analysis of experimental data and the                    design of a prototype wave-driven artificial upwelling device.                  Experimental data will be analyzed and compared with the                        theoretical results.",
