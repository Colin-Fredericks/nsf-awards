 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical integrated circuits will be at the heart of future high                 speed fiber optic communications.  These circuits require thin                  film optical components such as waveguides, couplers, and                       multiplexers.  However, at present there exists no technique for                fabrication of thin film components that is simple, fast,                       versatile, reliable and inexpensive.  The most basic optical                    component is the thin film passive waveguide, in which channels                 of different index of refraction, patterned in a thin film, serve               to conduct lightwaves.  A straightforward low - cost technique                  for making waveguides would have wide applicability to hybrid                   optical integrated circuits, since other optical components could               be generated with the same technology.                                                                                                                          In Phase I we demonstrate a novel waveguide fabrication method.                 We will use thin films of SiNx, Si0x, and SiCx that have been                   photosensitized by incorporation of bleachable organic dyes.                    These films will be masked and exposed to radiation; the                        resulting waveguide structures will be tested and evaluated.                    Bleaching of embedded dyes has been used to pattern polymer                     films.  The innovative element in our process is the use of hard                \"glass\" host-guest films, made by Jet Vapor Deposition.  JVD                    allows room temperature deposition of dye-doped glass films on                  existing silicon based microelectronic circuits.  JVD also has                  advantages in speed, flexibility and cost over sol-gel, CVD and                 high vacuum sputtering approaches.  Successful completion of this               project will advance the development of hybrid integrated optical               circuits for fiber optic communications.",
