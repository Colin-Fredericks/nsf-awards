 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant growth chambers with modern environmental controls will                   facilitate changes in the introductory biology curriculum,                      permitting an experimental motif whereby all students acquire                   research experiences and skills.  Descriptive, observational                    lab exercises in botany are being replaced by experiments that                  emphasize physiological processes.  Students then become                        involved with hypothesis formulation, data collection,                          statistical analysis, computer graphing, and report writing.                    Such a transformation meets several intertwined goals:  more                    engaging biology laboratory experiences, better retention of                    science students, heightened student interest in research                       careers, and improved research training for undergraduates.                     Growth chambers meet an urgent need for reliable environments                   in which to place botanical experiments; they also open new                     opportunities for experimental manipulations of temperature,                    humidity, and light regimes. Courses for introductory students                  and several courses for advanced undergraduates (Developmental                  Biology, Terrestrial Ecology, Plant Identification) will                        improve, and new opportunities will open for independent/team                   research projects by undergraduates and, during summers, by                     secondary students in the Governor's School for the Sciences.",
