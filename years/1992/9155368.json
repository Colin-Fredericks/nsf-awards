 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wesleyan University will conduct a two-year project to                          pilot-test a new teacher enhancement model: \"In-School                          Inservice Institute in Math and Science\".  Over 180 high                        school mathematics and science teachers in twelve                               Connecticut school districts will receive three weeks of                        intensive, on-site inservice and professional development                       during the school year by a visiting team of two university                     faculty and six Project to Increase Mastery of Mathematics                      and Science (PIMMS) master teachers and other expert                            demonstrators.  Participating teachers will conduct a                           variety of outreach activities for over 1800 second-wave                        teachers, for a total enhanced population of about 2000.                                                                                                        Two distinguishing features of the project are its collegial                    aspect and its team teaching approach.  A member of the                         Visiting Team will team up with a participant, with the                         Visiting Team member teaching the participant's classes                         while the participant is attending seminars and                                 demonstrations or observes a colleague's class.  Visitor and                    participant will also team-teach classes throughout the                         school day and will spend time discussing and reflecting                        upon the day's activities.  Thus, the Visiting Team should                      learn as much about secondary mathematics and science                           instruction as the high school teachers will learn about                        mathematics and science.                                                                                                                                        This in-school, collegial model has potential for success in                    a variety of settings.  Wesleyan University, PIMMS and                          school district cost-sharing accounts for 92% of the NSF                        budget.",
