 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the proposed research is to                            investigate the initiation of protein biosynthesis in animal                    mitochondria.  This process is unique in the animal                             mitochondrial system since initiation occurs at or within few                   nucleotides of the 5' end of the mRNA.  One animal mitochondrial                translational initiation factor has recently been                               purified. This factor (IF-2mt) is responsible for binding the                   initiator tRNA to ribosomes in response to the AUG codon.  In                   the present application, additional factors that are required                   for the assembly of the functional initiation complex on the                    mitochondrial ribosome will be investigated.  The components in                 addition to IF-2mt, required for the binding of the initiator                   tRNA to ribosomes in the presence of a natural mRNA will be                     identified.  These factors will then be purified, characterized                 and their roles in the initiation process investigated.                         Studies will be carried out to determine how the 5'end of the                   mRNA is recognized as the initiation signal in the animal                       mitochondrial system.  The role of proteins that interact with                  mitochondrial mRNAs and 28 S ribosomal subunits will be                         explored and the importance of mitochondrial membranes or                       membrane components will be analyzed.                                           %%%                                                                             Historically a tremendous amount of effort has been directed                    toward understanding the biochemistry and molecular biology of                  mitochondria.  This organelle is of prime importance in energy                  metabolism and cytoplasmic inheritance in eukarytic cells.                      Little is known about mitochondrial protein synthesis.  This                    proposal addresses the regulation of protein biosynthesis at                    the level of initiation.",
