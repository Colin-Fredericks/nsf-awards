 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deterrence research has focused more on the costs than the rewards              side of criminal offending.  Also, most of the research on                      deterrence has measured the threat of sanctions at a time far                   removed from the point at which the individual considers the                    commission of an offense.  But models based on rational choice                  assume deterrent effects to be instantaneous, not delayed.  In                  addition, most deterrence research fails to take into account the               wide range of contextual factors surrounding a criminal act.  To                overcome these deficiencies, Professor Paternoster, in                          collaboration with Daniel Nagin of Carnegie Mellon University, will             combine the use of judgement scenarios with traditional survey                  methods to analyze issues in deterrence theory.  This                           methodological innovation  will enable measurement of risk                      perceptions and intentions to offend under very specific and                    controlled circumstances.  Also, this innovative approach to                    deterrence research will permit the examination of the                          instantaneous relationship between the costs and benefits of                    offending and one's intention to commit a criminal act.                                                                                                         Specifically, the study will expose male college students to                    hypothetical situations related to sexual assault, theft and drunk              driving, criminal acts that this population shows a considerable                propensity to commit.  Also, the survey instrument enables                      collection of data on a range of variables related to the deterrent             effects of punishment, including the deterrent effect of formal                 versus informal sanctions, of the certainty versus the severity of              punishment, the impact of moral beliefs, and the determinants of                perceptions about risk of sanctions.  The analytical techniques                 will enable analysis of the data for each crime category                        separately.  The research will put to test the usefulness of the                scenario method for deterrence research, and holds promise for                  advancing empirical knowledge related to a series of recurring                  issues, yet unresolved, in the literature on the deterrent effects              of punishment.",
