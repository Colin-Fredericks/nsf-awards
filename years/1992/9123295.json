 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award for a long-term visit to the United Kingdom will                     support cooperative research in fungal ecology between David M.                 Sylvia of the University of Florida and Peter Jeffries of the                   University of Kent in the United Kingdom.  The objectives of their              research are to understand vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal                function in the soil and to evaluate the impact of the external fungal          hyphae on plant competition for soil nutrients.  Mycorrhizal fungi              have an important role in increasing plant uptake of phosphorous                and other poorly-mobile nutrients from soil. The external                       mycorrhizal hyphae are filament structures which enable the update              of nutrients through plant roots.  By studying the external hyphae,             the researchers will be able to evaluate the survival, distribution,            and competitive ability of VA mycorrhizal fungi in soil systems.                                                                                                Previous work on the hyphae of VA mycorrhizal fungi have been                   limited due to the difficulty of obtaining large quantities of hyphae           free from contaminating soil. The U.S. investigator brings to this              collaboration his technique of culturing fungi free from soil and               plant material.  This is complemented by the immunological                      approaches of Dr. Jeffries which will enable the investigators to               detect and evaluate the impact of mycorrhizal fungi in situ.",
