 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues joint research with Lawrence W. Conlon              (Washington University in St. Louis) on the structure of                        codimension-one foliations, work begun in 1975.  They have shown                that every open surface can occur as a leaf of some foliation and               ask what quasi-isometry types of surfaces can occur as leaves.                  Markov-exceptional local minimal sets are well-behaved, and the                 question arises whether every exceptional minimal set is in some                sense essentially a Markov one or, if not, at least has many of the             properties of a Markov one.  In a remarkable series of papers,                  Gabai has studied foliations of knot-complements, but much remains              to be done in this area.  For example, the principal investigator               intends to construct foliations of knot-complements that are easier             to visualize and then to use the Thurston ball of a certain second              homology group to describe all taut foliations of certain knot-                 complements.                                                                         A foliation of a manifold is a way of filling the manifold                 with lower dimensional pieces.  In the case of a codimension-one                foliation, these pieces are of dimension one less than that of the              given manifold.  Think of an onion or an artichoke.  The topology               of a manifold is strongly related to the kind of foliation which it             will support, and in skillful hands this relation has been forged               into a powerful tool for investigating the topology of manifolds.               It is an unintuitive fact that the major algebraic tools for                    investigating the topology of manifolds work best in the case of                high dimensional manifolds.  The geometric tool afforded by                     foliations is thus particularly welcome in the case of low                      dimensional manifolds.  A major instance of this is the                         investigation of the complement of a knot in the three-dimensional              sphere, which turns out to be an important way to gain information              about the knot itself.",
