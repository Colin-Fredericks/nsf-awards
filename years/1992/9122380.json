 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues to develop and apply Bayesian statistical                methods to important economic problems.  Past work by the                       investigator yielded many powerful analytical tools that are now                widely used in almost every area of theoretical and empirical                   research in economics.  The current project emphasizes finding                  explicit, reproducible procedures for producing models for                      observations, information-processing rules for combining models                 and other information, and procedures for evaluating alternative                models using data.  One contribution of this new research comes                 from formalizing current practice in constructing economic models               and evaluating them in a way that is reproducible and                           scientifically rigorous.  Preliminary work with these methods                   shows that the Bayesian approach can provide dramatically                       improved macroeconomic forecasts from U.S. quarterly                            macroeconomic data and from European data.  Improving the                       scientific rigor and the empirical accuracy of economic forecasts               is a goal of the economics of global change initiative.  For                    example, the methods being developed by this project are being                  used to combine and evaluate the very different forecasts from                  the four primary models of climate change.                                                                                                                      The main objective of this project is to provide a unified Bayes-               Maxent approach to econometric inference and modeling problems                  and examine its performance in two areas of application, macro-                 econometric modeling and forecasting and production function                    analysis.  In the Bayes-Maxent approach, models for observations                and their associated prior densities are derived as solutions to                explicit, constrained, optimization problems using entropy                      concepts.  Further, information-processing rules which combine                  prior densities and likelihood functions, for example Bayes's                   Theorem, are also derived as solutions to constrained maxent                    problems.  Research to characterize further and extend the                      applicability of the Bayes-Maxent approach are pursued.",
