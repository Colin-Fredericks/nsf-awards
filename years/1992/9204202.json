Work in three                  areas is planned.                                                                                                                                                    o    Work on both limited and unlimited randomness is to                             be continued on two fronts, new algorithms and                                  better tools for analyzing them.  The analytic tools                            include better bounds for tail events, and                                      extensions of operator theory to analyze performance                            in more difficult cases.                                                                                                                                   o    For suitably restricted classes, it should be                                   feasible to automate the generation of algorithms                               problems for teaching, and to formulate very high                               level languages that admit natural solutions and                                support automated verification and refutation.                                  Research for this section is aimed at exploring the                             fundamentals necessary to build a fledgling system                              to support the learning of algorithmic concepts.                                                                                                           o    While a rich variety of models for distributed                                  processing have been devised, and many algorithms                               have been analyzed within these theoretical                                     frameworks, some large scale machines are being                                 built that run on different principles.  This work                              is aimed at understanding such computation, which                               might be called semi-synchronous.",
