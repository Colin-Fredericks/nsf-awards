 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of NSF's \"Research in Undergraduate                        Institutions\" funding opportunity.  It supports the research of                 seven collaborating anthropologists studying the adjustment and                 inter ethnic relations of Guatemalan, Haitian, Cuban and Mexican                immigrants to South Florida, and the responses to these ethnic                  groups by native African Americans and Hispanics.  Using survey                 and intensive interviews schedules, the project will focus on                   political and economic behaviors, studying how these behaviors                  are maintained and revised by cultural factors such as religious                practices and family life, as well as social factors such as                    network formation, class, and relations with state agencies.                                                                                                    This research is important because the understanding of inter                   ethnic relations is of critical importance to modern societies.                 Such comparative case studies will help policy makers deal with                 feelings of unfairness and commitment to social order among                     diverse ethnic groups.",
