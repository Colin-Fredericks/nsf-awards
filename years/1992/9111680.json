 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Douglas Price and his colleagues will analyze strontium                     isotope ratios from the teeth and bones of prehistoric                          inhabitants of the Grasshopper.  Point of Pines, Turkey Creek and               Kinishba archaeological sites, all located in the Mogollon rim                  region of Arizona.  All date to ca. 14th century AD and mark a                  highpoint in the development of Southwestern Aboriginal American                culture.  The goal of the research is to determine the individual               migration patterns of residents over their lifetime.  The                       strontium isotope technique takes advantage of the fact that                    permanent dentition is formed early in life.  The strontium                     incorporated into the tooth enamel is not replaced over time.                   Bone strontium, however, is constantly replaced over the lifetime               of an individual.  Because the strontium taken into the human                   body is derived, via plants, animals and water, from the local                  soil, comparison between tooth and bone enamel from the same                    person can provide evidence on lifetime movement.  Luckily, in                  the Southwestern U.S., different geographical regions have                      distinct strontium isotopic signatures.                                                                                                                         The 14th century AD marks a high point in cultural development in               the Southwest.  Large ceremonial centers were constructed and                   extensive trade networks existed to minimize short-term                         geographical differences in production.  This implies the                       development of complex forms of social control and interaction.                 Anthropologists want to know how large sites such as Grasshopper                developed and were maintained and several theories have been                    proposed.  One places a major emphasis on migration and the                     consolidation of groups from different regions while others focus               on in situ processes.  The work undertaken by Dr. Price will                    provide direct evidence against which to evaluate these theories.                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons.  It will increase               our understanding of how complex societies develop and are                      maintained.  It will shed new light on the prehistory of the U.S.               Southwest and finally it will assist in the development of an                   extremely promising analytic technique.  It is the first instance               in which strontium isotope analysis is applied to an                            anthropological question.",
