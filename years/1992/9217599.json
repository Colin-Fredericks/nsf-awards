 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sevilleta LTER study site has become a regional focal point in a                debate centered on whether total release from grazing (a refuge)                is detrimental to diversity and primary productivity.  While                    detailed studies are occurring on the Sevilleta, there are few                  comparative studies on adjoining grazed land or land recently                   released from grazing pressure.  The current Sevilleta LTER                     Program is being conducted on a site that may itself be undergoing              successional changes following release from over three centuries                of intensive livestock grazing.  It is imperative to isolate and                understand the post-grazing changes on the Sevilleta landscape in               order to identify future sources of long-term ecosystem changes;                without a separation of grazing influences, efforts to                          attribute observable ecosystem changes to other causes, such as                 climate change or anthropogenic factors, will be confounded.                                                                                                    The Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1973,                 and livestock exclusion fences were erected in that year.  The                  summer of 1972, one year prior to livestock removal, was an                     unusually wet period, and was followed by a strong El Nino during               the winter-spring of 1972-73.  The combination of a very wet                    summer followed by a wet spring may have only a 20 year frequency               pattern.  In view of the importance of moisture regimes on arid                 ecosystem functioning, the antecedent conditions on the Sevilleta               in 1973 may have fostered an unusual \"successional trajectory\"                  that would be difficult, if not impossible, to simulate                         experimentally in the field.                                                                                                                                    However, an opportunity to perform just such an experiment has                  arisen as a result of the unusually wet weather patterns that have              occurred in central New Mexico in 1991-92.  The Sevilleta                       experienced an extremely wet summer in 1991.  The Sevilleta is                  presently in the midst of a strong El Nino that is producing late               winter and spring moisture.  The current weather conditions have                set the stage for studies that could simulate the transition that               occurred on the Sevilleta after 1973.  This combination of                      climatological events may occur only rarely (once every few                     decades) and it is important to initiate studies immediately                    to take advantage of these unusual circumstances.                                                                                                               This SGER project is based on (1) the fundamental need for site-                specific information on ecosystem effects of livestock removal,                 coupled with (2) the coincidental occurrence of weather conditions              that are very similar to those of nearly 20 years ago.",
