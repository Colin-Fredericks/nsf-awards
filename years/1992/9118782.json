Included in these                           experiments are the study of energy flow from individual                        quantum states of highly vibrationally excited molecules to                     acceptor collision partners; the quenching of electronically                    excited molecules with unpaired spins, with emphasis on the                     quantum states in which the acceptor molecules are left;                        reaction dynamics involving hot atom reagents; and non-reactive                 hot-atom collision processes which produce vibrationally                        excited collision partners.                                                     %%%                                                                             Experimental studies of chemical reactions and relaxation                       phenomena involving electronic, vibrational, and rotational                     energies of molecular systems are important to scientists                       examining the energy transfer mechanisms and chemical                           reactivity of relatively complex species.  Many biochemists,                    chemists, and physicists are interested in a detailed                           understanding of energy exchange in order to understand how                     chemical reactions occur as well as what causes a system                        undergoing collision to react rather than transfer any excess                   internal energy.  These experiments should help elucidate the                   fundamental forces which control reactive and nonreactive                       collision processes.",
