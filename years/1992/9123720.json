 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance knowledge about design of intelligent                 agents.  It has two objectives.  The first objective is the                     development of mathematical insights and procedures for automating              feature discovery and learning by evolution -- two biologically                 inspired forms of long-term learning -- in the construction of                  automatic pattern classifiers.  The second objective is the                     incorporation of automated feature discovery and evolution in                   automatic analyzers of large-scale image data banks and                         time-varying visual signals.  This project will work to achieve                 these objectives by building on the Principal Investigator's and                his students' techniques of adaptive hyperplane placement, window               training (an extended form of stochastic approximation), relaxed                branch-and-bound search, and genetic feature selection.  The                    project will implement and test the resulting mechanisms of                     long-term learning in three-stage neural classifiers of handwritten             numerical characters, tree classifiers of medical images in a large             data bank, and adaptive segmenter of moving objects in digitized                video.  This project will contribute to the technology of long term             learning in intelligent machines and to multi-sensor robotic vision             by automating the discovery of highly discriminating combinations               of features from diverse sensors.",
