 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to create and evaluate a model of                  the process by which people locate sounds in three dimensions.                  Emphasis will be placed on explaining well established but still                incompletely understood psycho-acoustical phenomena.  One example               is our ability to locate sounds coming from above or below,                     despite the fact that there are no binaural differences between                 the sounds that reach the ears.  Another example is our ability                 to locate sounds in reverberant environments that contain                       multiple sound sources, where echoes and reflections act as                     additional, virtual sources.  A third example is our ability to                 judge distance, since loudness alone is not an adequate cue.                    The model is based on the physical effects of sound propagation,                and on neurophysiological studies that have traced the auditory                 cortex.  It extends an existing computational model of the                      cochlea by incorporating monaural and binaural, temporally-based                correlation methods to extract the information needed for source                localization.  If successful, this work should significantly                    improve the abilities of computers to recognize speech or other                 sounds as they occur in everyday, multisource environments,                     thereby extending the range of effective human-machine                          interaction.",
