 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves safety and fault-tolerance problems                  raised in the development of safety-critical computing                          systems.  There are many computer applications in which safety                  and not reliability or availability is the overriding concern.                  Reduced or altered functionality of such systems is acceptable                  as long as no harm is done.                                                          Theoretical research will focus on the specification and                   design phases of the software lifecycle.  Specifically, the                     project will develop a framework of definitions of safety,                      establish the responsibility of the software engineer within                    that framework, and design software architectures to support                    the development of safe software.  It will investigate the                      possibility that an enhanced form of software reuse can be                      exploited to facilitate rapid development of specifications                     and designs for safe software.                                                       Empirical research will focus on a case study which will                   involve certain aspects of the software for an experimental                     safety-critical medical device.  The device, known as the                       Magnetic Stereotaxis System, is a new approach to various                       forms of therapy for brain disorders.  Software safety                          specifications will be constructed and a prototype built.                       Reuse libraries populated by a small number of parts derived                    from the case study will be built and used in subsequent                        studies of reuse technology.",
