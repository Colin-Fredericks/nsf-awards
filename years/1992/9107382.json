 "awd_abstract_narration": "The individuals constituting a species frequently differ in                appearance from one locality to another, but the processes which                result in this variation are often difficult to recognize.                      Processes producing such geographic differentiation include chance              events brought about by isolation or adaptation to local                        conditions.  Countering these processes is gene flow, the transfer              of genetic material from one location to another (e.g., via the                 movement of individuals).  Unfortunately, few examples exist where              the interplay among such processes is clearly understood.                            Island and mainland populations of snakes in western Lake Erie             provide a situation where the importance of gene flow can be                    studied with relative ease.  These populations are unusual because              of the large amount of color pattern variation they exhibit.                    Alternative explanations for this variation differ in the amount                of gene flow they require.  This project aims to measure rates of               gene flow among island and mainland snake populations using gel                 electrophoresis, a technique which makes use of genetically based               differences in protein structure to characterize variation within               and among populations.  Coupled with information on local                       adaptation and on the geological history of the region, this                    project will provide an unusually detailed picture of the processes             giving rise to geographic variation.",
