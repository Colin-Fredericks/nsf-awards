 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Moshe Matalon of Northwestern                     University to collaborate in a study of fluid dynamics with                     Professor Philippe Metzener of the Mathematics Department                       of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL).                         The goal of their research is to gain fundamental                               understanding of the basic mechanisms of instability in                         liquids for which viscosity depends strongly on                                 temperature.  They will examine in detail two important                         physical mechanisms of instability: thermal instability                         that arises when a fluid layer is heated from below, and                        shear instability.  The collaborators bring complementary                       strengths in applied mathematics to the proposed research,                      which involves mathematical modeling, mathematical analysis                     and numerical calculations.  Professor Matalon's strengths                      are in mathematical analysis.  He has expertise in                              asymptotic and perturbation methods derived from work on                        combustion problems and the mathematical modeling of                            chemically reacting flow problems. Professor Metzener has                       extensive experience studying problems of convection; he                        and his research group have strong computational and                            numerical skills.                                                                                                                                               Most previous work on instabilities in fluid flows has                          assumed a constant viscosity in the fluid.  While this has                      produced useful basic information, it is recognized that                        instabilities will be modified if the viscosity varies with                     temperature.  Such is the case in many real world systems,                      ranging from the movement of magma below the surface of the                     earth to the processing of industrially important polymers.                     Thus the results of this research will have a broad range                       of applications.",
