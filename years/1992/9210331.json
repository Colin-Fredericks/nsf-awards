 "awd_abstract_narration": "Threaded fasteners have found ubiquitous use in many systems and                structures. Although frequently overlooked, fasteners represent a               complex and often critical design element. To some extent, all                  fasteners are subjected to unsteady loading. Yet the behavior of                threaded fasteners under such conditions is still poorly                        understood. Existing analyses of threaded fasteners under                       vibration are based on static equilibrium conditions with                       supporting data limited to only low-frequency  conditions. Such                 analyses suggest that only a net loosening action can occur.                    However, preliminary experiments show that when a broad range of                vibratory conditions are considered, alternate ranges of                        frequencies are found in which either a loosening or a tightening               action occurs. The goals of this research are to perform well-                  controlled measurements of the dynamic  forces and motions of                   threaded fasteners under a wide range of dynamic conditions and                 to develop appropriate nonlinear dynamic models of threaded                     fasteners which capture and explain the dynamic loosening and                   tightening motions. The models will accommodate the interaction                 of friction and vibration as well as the dynamic constraints and                nonlinearities inherent to threaded components. The results of                  the work are expected to be of fundamental engineering interest                 and have immediate use in the design of joints in many critical                 applications.***//",
