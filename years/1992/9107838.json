 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fish family Cichlidae, is a model system for the study of              many biological phenomena.  Systematists, geneticists, ethologists,             comparative and functional morphologists have studied this family               probably more than any other teleostean group.  The extraordinary               adaptive radiation of cichlids in the East African Rift Lakes make              them an important subject for the study of morphology, speciation,              and sexual selection.  Members of this family of fishes also live               in Africa, Central and South America, Madagascar and India.  The                general aim of this study is to determine the systematic                        relationships among the major lineages of cichlid fishes.                            Current phylogenetic hypotheses about this family and its                  sistergroup relationships are exclusively based on morphological                characters, but evidence of morphological convergence suggests that             it will be important to have independent evidence of phylogeny.                      Recent advances in DNA technology have made it possible to                 address phylogenetic questions of the scope proposed here with                  molecular characters.  Mitochondrial genes will be sequenced and                the phylogenetic information used to construct phylogenetic                     relationships among the major lineages of cichlids.",
