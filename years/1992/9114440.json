 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed work is on two algorithmic topics in asynchronous                 numerics: fault-tolerance and locality.  The practical significance of          theoretical work in fault-tolerance is often limited because of                 particular assumptions made about possible fault patterns.  In some             applications, making unjustifiable assumptions could have grave                 consequences.  The major goals of this research are to develop a basic          theory of fault-tolerant communication protocols, that will be free of          unnecessary assumptions, and to apply this theory to real network               tasks.  As a general approach a novel self-stabilization framework is           proposed.  Self-stabilization is a basic robustness property that               enables the system to return to correct operation after an arbitrary            pattern of failures.                                                                                                                                            Traditional network management protocols use locality requiring all             sites to maintain full information about the network topology.  This            task becomes very complex in large networks.  In a high-speed                   environment, the required rate of global state change may be much               faster than the propagation delay, thus making it impossible to obtain          an accurate picture of the global state of the network.  Fault-                 tolerance and locality properties are crucial to ensure graceful                degradation of the overall system under conditions of extreme stress.                                                                                           A universal network decomposition approach is proposed, that allows             such properties for a variety of network tasks.  There is already a             wide range of important applications for which this approach has                proved to be successful, including network routing, distributed                 directories, online tracking of mobile users, resource allocation and           load balancing, network synchronization, shortest paths, deadlock               avoidance, and others.  For these tasks our approach yields, for the            first time, almost optimal solutions.",
