 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will determine the structure of certain mammalian                 transcription complexes and describe their relationship to the                  control of both transcription and replication.  First, in situ                  probing methods will be used to follow changes in SV40                          nucleoprotein complexes as the viral lytic cycle proceeds.  Altered             viral templates, with specified functional defects, will be used to             show which structures are important for which functions.  The                   results will reveal the importance of the structural changes that               accompany the replication-dependent changes in transcription                    patterns.  Second, the communication between the SV40 origin of                 replication origin and the transcription elements will be                       investigated.  Plasmids will be constructed that contain single and             multiple copies of various transcription elements in the context of             SV40 origin.  Transcription and replication assays in cos cells                 will be used to learn how each process is affected by the presence              of both types of elements.  Cooperation of this kind is known to be             important, and its mechanism will be further explored by following              the changes in chromatin caused by the regulatory elements.  Third,             exploratory experiments will be conducted aimed at assessing                    structural changes that might accompany transcription initiation by             polymerase II in vivo and in vitro.                                             %%%                                                                             A virus must transcribe certain of its genes in a defined manner to             produce the enzymatic machinery necessary for viral development and             replication. First, cells will be infected with the SV40 virus and              at various times protein binding to specific regions of the viral               genome will be determined.  Once a region of the viral genome is                found which is involved in protein binding, it will be altered in               certain regions to assess the function of individual bases.  The                results will reveal the importance of sequence and structural                   changes that accompany the replication-dependent changes in                     transcription patterns.  Second, the interactions between the SV40              origin of replication and the DNA sequences involved in gene                    expression will be investigated.  Plasmids will be constructed that             contain single and multiple copies of various transcription                     elements in the context of SV40 origin.  Transcription and                      replication assays in cells will be used to learn how each process              is affected by the presence of both types of structures.                        Interactions of these kind are known to be important, and their                 mechanism will be explored by following the changes in DNA-protein              structure caused by the regulatory elements.  Third, exploratory                experiments will be conducted aimed at assessing any structural                 changes in the gene-protein complex that might accompany the                    initiation of mRNA synthesis.",
