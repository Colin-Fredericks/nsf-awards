 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will address the ecology of an Antarctic predatory                copepod, Euchaeta antarctica, a biomass dominant and important                  macroplanktonic carnivore in Croker Passage, a deep basin off the               Antarctic peninsula.  Previous work has shown that size-selective               feeding on crustacean prey more than adequately covers respiratory              costs so excess dietary input could be stored by this large                     lipid-rich copepod.  With the onset of winter, feeding stops,                   respiration and excretion rates decline and oxygen/nitrogen ratio               increases, indicating  a shift from a protein and lipid based                   metabolism to a lipid-dominated metabolism, corroborating summer                feeding activity and winter reliance on lipids.  During winter,                 nearly all females are reproductively mature, producing multiple                clutches of lipid-rich eggs from their maternal stores.  Early                  stages mature slowly so the first feeding stage appears in                      the plankton in synchrony with the active bloom in southern                     waters.  The extreme seasonality of food availability in this                   polar region enforces the separation of 2 processes:  feeding in                summer and reproduction in winter.  This project will complete the              lipid analyses, an essential component of this research.  Samples,              previously collected, permit an analysis of total lipid content,                lipid class composition and production rates by different copepodid             stages during three different seasons, and by different                         reproductive states of the adult female in the winter.  This work               will allow for an evaluation of whether the stored reserves are                 sufficient to provide energy to support winter metabolic rates and              reproductive demands and will provide an understanding of the                   linkage between lipid content/composition and life history                      strategies.",
