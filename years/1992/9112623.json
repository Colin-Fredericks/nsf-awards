 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genus Conopholis belongs to a family of parasitic                      plants, the Orobanchaceae.  The plants are obligate parasites on                other plants, from which they derive all of their nutrients and                 water.  Possibly as a direct result of this parasitism these                    plants have lost the ability to photosynthesize and lack the                    characteristic green color conferred by the presence of                         chlorophyll.  The plastids (the organelle which in green plants                 houses the photosynthetic metabolism and has its own circular                   genome containing about 120 genes, including some of those                      involved in photosynthesis) of  Conopholis contain a genome only                a third the size of that in green plants and have lost several                  important photosynthesis genes.  This has occurred through the                  accumulation of several large deletions of DNA.  The large amount               of variation in the plastid genome detectable between different                 populations of Conopholis indicate that it is continuing to                     evolve at an accelerated rate.                                                       DNA sequencing methods will be used to investigate how these               deletions have occurred and what has happened to plastid genes                  which have not been deleted.  Those that remain intact will be                  investigated for non-photosynthetic functions.  The evolution of                the non-functional photosynthesis genes remaining in the plastid                genome will be compared with their counterparts in the nuclear                  genome in order to find out if they have had different fates as a               result of different molecular processes occurring in these two                  genomes.",
