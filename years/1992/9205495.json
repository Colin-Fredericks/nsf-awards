 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1992 Northeast Regional Conference on Developmental Biology                 will be held at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA                on the weekend of May 1-3. This proposal is for funds to support                graduate student attendance and participation at the meeting. The               Conference is organized with the intent of bringing  together a                 broad range of developmental biologists, at various stages of                   their careers, to present and discuss their research in formal                  and informal settings. Further, the organizers continue to                      integrate research in both plant and animal developmental biology               in an effort to enhance the communication between groups that                   have traditionally been separated. The Conference will include                  four formal platform sessions and two poster presentation                       sessions, as well as a keynote address and a second featured                    presentation by prominent developmental biologists. The                         established investigators chairing the platform sessions are                    encouraged to solicit presentation from graduate students,                      postdoctorals, and junior faculty, and all graduate students                    attending the meeting are encouraged to present their work in the               poster sessions.",
