 "awd_abstract_narration": "A common strategy in econometric analyses is to divide the                      variables of interest into two types.  The first type is that of                a dependent variables whose distribution in the population is to                be explained in terms of variables of the second type, the                      independent or explanatory variables.   If the data to be                       analyzed were randomly selected from the population of interest,                then methods exist for estimating the parameters of the                         conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the                    explanatory variable.  These estimators are consistent, efficient               and have other desirable properties.  But some of the most                      important properties do not hold if, as is frequently the case in               applied economics, the data are not random.  This project                       develops estimation procedures and specification tests that are                 both intuitive and computationally feasible for nonrandom or                    partially random sampling procedures that are frequently                        encountered in economic problems.  These techniques are used to                 analyze partially random data sets on Dutch labor market                        participation.                                                                                                                                                  This project addresses the question of inference if the                         researcher has information on the parameters other than a random                dataset.  Examples of sampling schemes studied by this project                  include: 1) samples that are endogenously stratified; 2)                        additional information on moments of the distribution of the                    dependent variables from aggregate sources; and 3) datasets                     containing different sets of variables.  The application of these               techniques to actual problems is used to show that they are                     feasible and that they can lead to major efficient gains.",
