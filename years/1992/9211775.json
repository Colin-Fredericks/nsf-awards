 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the first five years of the Arctic LTER at Toolik Lake,                  Alaska, systematic measurements of climate, of tundra plant                     distribution and productivity, and of lake and stream physics,                  chemistry and biology were begun.  Whole system experiments were                set up on the tundra, in streams, and in lakes to examine the                   ecological effects of changes in environmental and biological                   factors such as air temperature, added nutrients, and changes in                the density of the top predators and grazers.  These measurements               and long-term experiments are designed to help reach the overall                goal: to understand how tundra, streams and lakes function in the               Arctic and to predict how they respond to human-induced changes                 including climate                                                               change.  Under this broad goal there are three specific goals:                                                                                                  (1)   Determine year-to-year ecological variability in these                          systems and measure long-term changes.                                                                                                                    (2)   Understand the extent of control by resources (bottom-up                        control) or by grazing and predation (top-down control).                                                                                                  (3)   Measure rates and understand the controls of the exchange of                    nutrients and organic matter between land and water.                                                                                                      Long-term experiments are the heart of the Arctic LTER program.                 It has been found that arctic systems often do not respond for                  many years, and that long-term responses are often not predictable              from short-term responses.  Changes in the responses of both                    streams and terrestrial vegetation to nutrient amendments are                   still being documented after 9 years.  Lake trout manipulations                 take many years to show effects as these long-lived fish may                    change their diet from invertebrates to fish when they reach a                  certain size.  As a result, most long-term experiments and                      measurements for determining ecological variability will be                     continued.                                                                                                                                                      The results of the long-term experiments will continue to be                    measured as more is discovered about long-term ecosystem controls               by resources and predation.  New research on the controls of the                exchange of nutrients between land and water will be started.  A                major watershed experiment will be carried out to measure the                   movements of water and dissolved gases through the groundwater and              into the streams.",
