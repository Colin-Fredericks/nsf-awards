 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is directed at developing immunoassay diagnostics                  for potential field-kit use that would more easily determine the                ripening of pome fruit (e.g. fruit with internal seeds).  The                   focus will be on developing enzyme-linked immuno system assays                  (ELISA's) which are specific and highly sensitive in detecting                  proteins associated with ripening.  During Phase I polyclonal                   antibodies were produced against malic enzyme and post-initiation               protein pAp5 and crude ELISA's were developed.  In Phase II                     monoclonal antibodies will be produced to improve their                         specificity and sensitivity.  Prototypes will be developed and                  validated.  These ELISAs will be used to quantitate changes in                  specific proteins that occur in synchrony with or just prior to                 the onset of the ripening process.  Efficacy tests will be                      performed with fruits from experimental controlled atmosphere                   (CA) storage which maintains fruits in the preclimacteric                       condition.  Gene expression of these proteins also will be                      investigated by Michigan State University scientists.  the                      diagnostics developed could have major economic benefits for                    fruit growers by minimizing losses incurred too early or too late               picking of fruit.",
