 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most geographical studies of waterways and boundaries have                 emphasized the boundary function of waterways, particularly                     between political entities.  Few studies have addressed the                     problems associated with state ownership of waterbottoms.  The                  important issue in determining ownership is navigability because                most states own the waterbottoms of all naturally formed                        navigable waterways.  In recent years, the problem of waterbottom               ownership determination has been magnified by accelerating rates                of land loss along coastal zones and channel filling within                     drainage basins.  In the state of Louisiana, both of these                      changes are due, in part, to cultural alterations of sediment-                  bearing channel flow.  This research project will examine the                   impact of waterway changes on ownership of waterbottoms within                  south Louisiana waterways.  It will test the hypothesis that the                state is losing ownership of property through accretion within                  areas of extensive deposition while it is gaining property                      through erosion within the coastal zone.  The Atchafalaya Basin                 and the Bayou Lafourche will be compared as extremes of these two               processes.  Geological, historical, geographical and legal data                 will be assembled in order to test the hypothesis.                                   This study is unique in that it addresses the ownership of a               particular type of property, the waterbottoms of inland and                     coastal waterways.  It blends geomorphological evidence with                    legal decisions to better understand the relationship between                   natural and cultural processes which modify waterway boundaries                 and the legal framework for adjudicating disputes over                          boundaries.  It will have practical applications to boundary                    determination problems elsewhere, and it will further elucidate                 the problems which occur when the legal and legislative systems                 lag behind the actual physical changes to boundaries.",
