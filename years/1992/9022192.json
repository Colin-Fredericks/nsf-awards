 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program provides for general support of an                           interdisciplinary center for advanced study,  including the                     support of selected behavioral scientists for year-long                         residential fellowships and the funding of several specific                     activities designed to enrich the intellectual environment in                   which these residents operate.                                                        The Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral                           Sciences (CASBS) was created 36 years ago to carry out this                     activity.  Direct stipend support of behavioral scientists                      constitutes the core of the Center's purpose and function.                      The Fellows supported by National Science Foundation funds                      represent those areas of the behavioral sciences that                           traditionally have been supported by NSF,  as contrasted with                   the Fellows typically supported  by such sources as the                         National Endowment for the Humanities and the Andrew W.                         Mellon Foundation.  A number of these scientists will be                        involved in prearranged collaborative activites considered to                   be of high scientific and societal priority.                                          A portion of the program helps the Center identify and                    support promising scientists too young to have established a                    national or international reputation.  Special efforts are                      made to include women and minority scientists,  as well as                      some scholars from beyond the nation's largest and most                         visible universities.  The program also helps to insure that                    a top-quality computing and communication environment is                        available for its Fellows.                                                            The Center has proven to be a remarkably successful                       institutional innovation.  It can be expected to continue to                    strengthen the behavioral sciences and interdisciplinary                        collaboration among them.",
