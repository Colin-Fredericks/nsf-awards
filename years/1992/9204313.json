 "awd_abstract_narration": "The actual role of CO2 as a \"greenhouse\" gas in the Earth's                past can only be learned from proxy data on ancient atmospheric                 Pco2 and corresponding climatic temperatures.  Research conducted               in this laboratory has found that the oxygen isotope systematics                of the common mineral goethite (a-FEOOH) make it a suitable                     indicator of paleotempeatures and ancient sources of water.                     Furthermore, we have discovered that goethite contains an apparent              Fe(CO3)OH component in solid solution whose abundance is related                to ancient ambient Pco2.  These characteristics of natural                      goethites have been used to deduce tropical temperatures and                    atmospheric CO2 pressures 440 million years ago.                                     A broader application of these properties of goethite is                   planned.  Part of the work well involve experimental study of the               isotopic effects of substitution of Al for Fe in goethite.  Such                information is of importance to isotopic paleoclimatic research                 involving goethites in tropical soils, where degrees of Al                      substitution can be high.  another portion of the proposed research             will undertake the study of the oxygen isotope systematics of                   goethite + phosphate as a promising mineral pair oxygen isotope                 paleothermometer.  The two-component CO2 mixing model for soils (as             manifested in the Fe(CO3)OH component of surficial goethite) will               be tested further as a third aspect of the research with data                   obtained from goethite in active Cenozoic laterites.                            Goethite-bearing Mesozoic oolitic ironstones and laterite will also             be isotopically, etc., analyzed to evaluate ancient temperatures,               water sources and possibly atmospheric CO2 pressures.",
