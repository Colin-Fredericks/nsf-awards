 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year mathematics project will develop and evaluate                   a model professional development program for high school                        mathematics teachers from twenty schools in three districts in                  the San Jose, California, area.  The project is designed to                     provide 80 teacher leaders with the knowledge, skills, and                      understandings necessary to lead  implementation of curriculum                  innovations in their schools.  Participants will be involved                    in three levels of summer institutes and extensive academic                     year follow-up sessions that involve leadership training,                       staff and peer coaching, demonstration lessons, micro-                          teaching, reflection about teaching and learning mathematics,                   and development of site-based Professional Development                          Centers.  Participants will refresh and enhance their content                   knowledge, teach and evaluate innovative curricula, work to                     integrate technology into their teaching, and use analysis and                  application of mathematics education research, reflective                       essays, journals, peer coaching,and discussions to reflect on                   and broaden their beliefs about teaching and learning                           mathematics.  The participants will present inservice to other                  teachers and will become coordinators of the Professional                       Development Centers, which will serve, after the project ends,                  as the site for the school's ongoing program for staff                          development and curricular and instructional change.                            Contributions by the university and school districts will                       provide a cost share of approximately 39%.",
