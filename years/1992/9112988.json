 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                               Organometallic Chemistry program, Professor Clark Landis of the                 University of Wisconsin, Madison will undertake the development                 of new computational and experimental tools for elucidation of                  solution structures of organometallic molecules.  Landis will                   develop methods for fitting experimental Nuclear Overhauser                     Effect timecourses in NMR spectra of organometallic molecules                   with timecourses that are calculated based on a population of                   possible conformers.  Ensembles of possible conformers will be                  generated using force field minimization methods combined with                  systematic or Monte Carlo searching techniques.  Solvent                        mixtures of high viscosity will be used to partially eliminate                  the loss of NOE due to rapid spin relaxation that normally                      results from the rapid rotation of small molecules.  Secondly,                  a new empirical force field method (SHAPES) that is                             specifically designed for describing complex geometries of                      transition metal containing compounds will be developed.  Both                  techniques will be applied to the determination of structures                   of homogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation and alpha-olefin                        catalysts.  The ultimate aim of the research is the                             determination of the reasons behind the high stereoselectivity                  of these catalysts and the prediction of new and more highly                    stereoselective catalysts for these and other types of                          reactions.                                                                      %%%                                                                             New methods for the determination of structures of transition                   metal organometallic molecules in solution will be studied.                     Complex molecules in solutions are constantly twisting and                      turning, with consequent changes in overall shape.  One of the                  methods to be developed to study molecular shapes in solution                   will utilize a variation of nuclear magnetic resonance                          spectroscopy (Nuclear Overhauser Effect).  The existence of                     various conformational isomers (molecules with different                        twists) of the dissolved organometallic compounds will be                       considered in the interpretation of the spectral data so as to                  provide structural information for all participating isomers.                   Only an average structure can be deduced using existing                         methods.  The second method to be developed will allow for the                  determination of structures using molecular mechanics methods                   that are specifically tailored to include parameters for                        transition metals.  Such techniques are well developed for                      small organic molecules and proteins but have only begun to be                  applied to the computation of structures of organometallic                      molecules.  The ultimate objective of the work is to be able to                 understand the origins of stereoselectivity in reactions                        catalyzed by organometallic compounds.  Such reactions are very                 important in the chemical industry with applications to the                     manufacture of commodity, fine and specialty chemicals.  An                     understanding of catalytic stereoselectivity potentially                        influences issues such as energy and raw materials utilization.",
