The technique is based on determination of the nature of                        the genetic material that is unique to the different                            target pathogens using an analytical procedure that                             amplifies the nucleic acid chain of the target organisms                        for ease of identification and quantification.  The                             research involves concentration of the pathogens using a                        rotating membrane ultrafiltration medium and subsequent                         detection of the pathogens using the polymerase chain                           reaction procedure.                                                                                                                                             This research addresses limitations of procedures                               currently used for determining the microbiological quality                      of an environmental water.  These procedures depend on the                      analysis for surrogate microorganisms as a step toward                          establishing the significance of their presence.   This                         project is a renewal of work initiated under NSF Small                          Grant for Exploratory Research No. 92-01324 results of                          which were utilized to develop the research plan for this                       project.",
