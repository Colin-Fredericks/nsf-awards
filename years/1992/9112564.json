 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extension of the period of useful forecasts by dynamical-                  numerical models of the atmospheric circulation is the goal of a                rapidly growing body of ongoing and proposed research in large                  scale dynamic meteorology. Recent success in improving the accuracy             and utility of short (0-5 day)-, and medium (5-10 day)-range numer-             ical forecasts has stimulated intensified interest in the problems              associated with developing models that can exhibit forecast skill               in the extended (10 day to seasonal)-range and beyond.  One line of             research concerns the set of observed atmospheric flow phenomena                with characteristic periods of variation in the extended range, and             generally of hemispheric/global spatial scale (in particular, mid-              latitude \"blocking\", teleconnection patterns, and zonal index                   cycles of the jet-stream and its associated storm-track regions).               The PI's propose to study the processes leading to the onset and                evolution of similar features in a suite of simple theoretical                  models which have exhibited similar behavior in their prior                     research. Understanding these processes in such simple models will              help to guide the interpretation of forecast errors in the solu-                tions of the more complex quasi-operational models now being used               in experimental dynamical extended-range forecasts, and the step-               wise elimination of the sources of these errors.",
