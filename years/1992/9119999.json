 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rutgers University, in cooperation with Princeton University, AT&T            Bell Laboratories (Bell Labs), and Bell Communications Research                 (Bellcore) has established a Science and Technology Center for                  Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science.  The Director            of the Center is Professor Daniel Gorenstein of Rutgers University.               The Center in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science           strengthens the development of these two overlapping areas by                   focussing research activity in a continuing series of year-long                 research programs, workshops and conferences.  Approximately on                 hundred researchers from the four collaborating conferences.                    Approximately one hundred researchers from the four collaborating               institutions provide the background coherence and direction for this            activity.  The core of the research activity is carried out by a                vigorous program of visitors (both senior and junior) from other                institutions (academic, industrial, government laboratory).                     Postdoctoral fellows and graduate students are affiliated with the              Center for varying lengths of time.                                               Each year, the Center designates specific areas for special                   attention, inviting leading experts in the designated fields to                 organize a research program in those areas of concentration.  These             areas are chosen to take advantage of the expertise of the                      participating personnel from the collaborating institutions while               addressing questions of demonstrable interest to researchers in both            the discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science communities.            Within these general guidelines, there are several avenues of                 potential emphasis that involve both serious theoretical inquiry and            relevant application.  For example, our modern \"information society\"            depends on clear, efficiently designed and reliable telecommunications          and communications systems.  These are easily described by network              theory and can be modeled using linear programming techniques.                  Transportation problems require similar techniques; and optimization            and linear programming, possibly enhanced by parallel computations,             are critical in VLSI design and manufacture.                                      Discrete and computational geometry are foundational disciplines for          computer graphics and robotics.  As the geometries required for the             applications become increasingly more complex, research in                      computational geometry becomes ever more important.  Yet there are              fundamental questions in discrete and computational geometry that must          be addressed before the applications can be realized.",
