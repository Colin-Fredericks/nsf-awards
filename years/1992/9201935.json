 "awd_abstract_narration": "The common theme of this differential topology project is to               study invariants of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds, their relations             to the theory of transformation groups, geometry of submanifolds,               quantum physics, moduli spaces of instantons, and related questions             on cohomology of discrete groups.  The investigator will continue               his work with Sylvain Cappell and E. Y. Miller on the theory of                 generalized Casson flows, on Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants,              on spectral flow invariants of 3-manifolds, and on the application              of symplectic geometry techniques in Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index                 theory.  Jointly with Dariusz Wilczynski, he intends to investigate             representing homology classes of 4-manifolds by surfaces of minimal             genus.  A related topic is the joint work of I. Hambleton and the               investigator on the theory of smooth transformation groups on 4-                manifolds, equivariant moduli spaces of instantons, and the                     equivariant Donaldson invariant.  Together with Steven Weintraub,               he plans to continue their work on the cohomology of arithmetic                 subgroups of Sp4 and also on an invariant of ramified covering                  spaces originating from the work of J.-P. Serre.  Finally, with                 Alan Brownstein, the investigator plans to study the motion group               of n-strings in 3-space, its cohomology, and related moduli spaces.                  Traditionally, differential topology has provided a means of               analyzing certain questions about the world we live in, its                     geometry and its physics, but in recent years the situation has                 become much more fluid, with physics often providing useful                     geometric notions as much as vice versa.  The latest such foreign               imports so to speak have been the Donaldson invariant of 4-                     manifolds and related invariants discovered since but along the                 same lines.  There is, of course, a long history of mathematicians              involving themselves in the problems of physics, often to the                   mutual enrichment of both subjects.  Tools are developed to solve               physical problems, and these tools then turn out to have much                   greater generality and become widely used in mathematics.  The                  story of the new quantum invariants of 3-manifolds is a variation               on this theme.  Mathematicians interesting themselves in problems               of quantum field theory were led to a certain geometric                         construction.  The construction led in turn to an invariant that                depended only on the topological character and not the full                     geometric character of the underlying manifold.  There are now                  modifications of the original construction and numerous resulting               quantum invariants.  Their origin is sufficiently different from                that of other previously known invariants that they can be expected             to detect things the traditional invariants cannot.  It now                     behooves topologists to demonstrate this as well as to sort out the             different quantum invariants and their relationships to more                    traditional invariants.  Work along these lines will be among the               projects undertaken by the investigator with some of his legion of              collaborators.",
