Specifically, the proposer will work with the National Science                  Foundation to initiate eight new Venture school-based projects in               Washington, DC.  The Ventures (Macy) program in the selected DC                 public schools will comprise all core areas of the curriculum:                  English, mathematics, science, social studies, and foreign                      languages.  Also included are the academic and non-academic                     aspects of a comprehensive educational program, including                       personal guidance and counseling services, formalized educational               experiences that develop cognitive problem-solving and analytical               skills, and activities that focus on enhancing independent study.                                                                                               Support will also be provided to continue faculty development                   activities at the original Macy-sponsored schools in Alabama and                New York as well as the participating DC schools.  In addition,                 evaluation studies will be continued for all the sponsored                      schools.",
