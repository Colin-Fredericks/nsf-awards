The                                      Water Resources Center and the International                                    Programs and Studies Unit of UIUC are both                                      collaborating in the organization and conduct                                   of the conference.  The conference is to                                        address the currently proposed ideas to deal                                    with the floods and resulting destruction in                                    Bangladesh with special consideration to the                                    impact on life protection, environmental                                        issues, and availability of needed resources.                                   Sessions will include:  existent plans; pre-                                    feasibility studies; engineering and                                            hydrological issues; agriculture and economy;                                   and environment and society.  Summary and                                       recommendations will be discussed in a separate                                 session.   The meeting is to include in                                         addition to the U.S. and invited Bangladeshi                                    scientists, experts from France and Japan, and                                  from other European countries.  The results                                     will be published in a Proceedings Volume to be                                 made available to international agencies and to                                 the Government of bangladesh for consideration                                  and implementation.                                                                                                                                             Scope:  The flood problems in Bangladesh are                                    well known for their frequency and wide                                         destruction.  Less known is the main benefits                                   to food production that they normally provide.                                  Learning to minimize one and maximize the other                                 is part of national and international efforts.                                  A sound scientific basis for these efforts is                                   what is planned for this meeting.  The results                                  could be of more generic benefit for countries                                  with similar problems.",
