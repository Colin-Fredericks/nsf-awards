 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to permit Dr. Kongki Min,                             Department of Physics, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,                        to pursue with Dr. Jong Chan Kim, Department of Physics,                        Seoul National University, for 24 months, a program of                          cooperative research in medium energy physics.  These                           scientists and members of their research groups will                            collaborate in a study of photopion reactions in light                          nuclei, using quasi-monoenergetic photons (gamma rays).                         Two experiments will be undertaken.  The first is                               directed toward understanding the spin-isospin mode                             nuclear excitations in A=12 and A=13 systems and their                          similarities, while the second experiment will elucidate                        the reaction mechanism of the photopion production                              process, especially the effect of delta dynamics in                             nuclei.  These experiments will be conducted at the                             Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory, University of                              Saskatchewan, a unique research facility in Canada which                        has allocated nearly 700 hours of beam time for this                            research.                                                                                                                                                       The proposed research should provide valuable                                   information on the structure of atomic nuclei and                               nuclear reaction mechanisms.  The U.S. and Korean                               collaborators are highly respected scientists with                              proven ability in this field.  They have collaborated                           successfully in related research under NSF Grant No.                            INT-8819820.  The present project will add an                                   international cooperative dimension to Dr. Min's                                research under NSF Grant No. PHY-8905162 and will allow                         the collaborators to combine their talents and interests                        for mutual benefit.  This project is relevant to the                            objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program                        which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                        U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the                            exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                          techniques and through collaboration on problems of                             mutual benefit.  Korean participation in the project is                         supported by the Korea Science and Engineering                                  Foundation (KOSEF).",
