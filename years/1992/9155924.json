 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a workshop aimed at the familiarization                   of teachers of introductory courses in materials science and                    engineering with a new approach developed over the past four                    years at the University of Pennsylvania.  The goals are to                      stimulate these teachers to experiment with this approach and                   to give input into the text developed for the new course, which                 is approaching the stage of final revision.  The course is                      aimed at first- or second-year undergraduates in any                            engineering discipline, including materials science, and at                     non-engineering students with advanced high-school-level                        preparation in physics, chemistry, and calculus.  The                           innovation consists in placing all the topics covered in the                    now-traditional type of introductory course into a familiar                     context for students encountering the subject for the first                     time.  This is done by using the bicycle and the Walkman as the                 paradigms for, in effect, two giant case studies.  The use of                   these contexts enables the student to comprehend the subject in                 a unified way in a one-semester course and to be able to apply                  it to engineering situations.  It has also stimulated more of                   them to pursue the subject at a higher level than was the case                  with the traditional-type of course.  The potential impact of                   this new approach is a significant increase in the number of                    engineering students able to apply the basic principles of                      materials science and engineering in their own disciplines,  as                 well as some increase in the number of uncommitted students                     attracted to engineering as a major.",
