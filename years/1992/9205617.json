 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water is absolutely necessary for the intestine to absorb food and              dispose of wastes. The amount of water in the intestine is                      regulated by a small protein hormone produced in the wall of that               organ. Too little water results in the release of this hormone,                 stimulating the cells lining the intestine to secrete water. Too                much water results in a decrease in the release of this hormone,                reducing water secretion into the intestine. However, it is unclear             how this hormone stimulates intestinal cells to secrete water. It               is known that the hormone binds to specific protein receptors on                the surface of intestinal cells to stimulate secretion.                         Interestingly, there appear to be several receptors for this                    hormone with different structures and functions. These receptors                appear to activate different signalling mechanisms in the cell.                 Which signalling pathway is responsible for triggering secretion                is unknown. Also, which receptors are coupled to different                      signalling pathways has not been defined. Finally, the                          relationships between the different structures and functions of                 these receptors have not been examined. Studies outlined in this                proposal involve the purification of these different receptors from             intestinal cells. The structure and function of these isolated                  receptors will be defined and compared, to establish their                      relationship. The coupling of these different purified receptors                to cellular signalling pathways will be established, to determine               which receptor and signal pathway is involved in regulating                     intestinal secretion. These studies are significant because they                will define basic mechanisms regulating a key intestinal function               at the molecular level. In addition, the fundamental mechanisms                 coupling receptors and signalling pathways defined in these studies             are generally applicable to the regulation of other organs,                     including the kidney and blood vessels.",
