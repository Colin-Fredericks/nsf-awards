 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predation hazard or intimidation plays an important role in the                 ecology of freshwater communities by structuring habitat use by                 member species.  Locally, intimidation may suppress growth and                  reproduction, thereby directly affecting the population dynamics                of member species.  While intimidation from predators is known to               produce local effects, no experimental work has addressed the                   important question of how intimidation is expressed on larger                   scales; i.e. the scale of whole streams or watersheds on Iotic                  systems.  The goal of this proposal is to explore that question in              a tropical stream fish community.  We will test the hypothesis that             predators, through intimidation and direct killing, can generate                observed patterns across a large (geographic) scale, and also a                 hypothesis that competition is responsible for an observed pattern.             We will test specific predictions derived from the hypotheses in                controlled experiments in an tropical first- and second-order                   experimental stream system, and by conducting a large scale survey              of the Paria drainage in the Northern Range Mountains of Trinidad.",
