 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed workshop (in mid-September 1992 in Fortaleza and                   Florianopolis, Brazil) will develop a major focus of the research               agenda for the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research              (IAI) -- ENSO and interannual climate variability.  In particular, the          workshop will (1) identify issues related to the application of                 forecasts of seasonal-to-interannual climate variability to the                 decision-making process at national and regional levels and (2) define          methods through which such forecasts can most effectively be                    applied to these processes.  The workshop is expected to develop                recommendations for developing a systematic flow of global climate              forecasts to decision-makers at national and regional levels.  The              workshop is also expected to identify needs for education and                   training in this area and to prepare of recommendations for                     addressing these needs.  The workshop will focus on two specific                regions -- the drought-affected region of northeastern Brazil and the           tropical and sub-tropical regions of southeastern South America                 which have been impacted by ENSO.",
