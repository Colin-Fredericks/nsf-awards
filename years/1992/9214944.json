 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective use of quantitative information from manufacturing               processes of integrated-circuits (IC) is crucial in monitoring                  process potentials, identifying optimal settings, and improving the             quality in general.  Although process yield is the primary concern              in the IC manufacturing industry, spatial dependence among chips                on a wafer provides an opportunity to learn more about the process.             Design of experiments has been proven to be effective for examining             numerous factors simultaneously in industrial processes.  The major             objective of this project is to investigate the impact of factorial             experiments on both yield and spatial dependence, especially when               the outcome of each chip is coded as either good or bad in routine              testing.                                                                             This project will begin by studying log-linear models that are             successfully implemented in the social sciences and biomedical                  research.  This class of models will be adapted to incorporate both             yield effects and spatial effects under factorial experimentation               (more recently referred to as Taguchi experiments).  Proper use of              this model provides an opportunity to better understand the IC                  manufacturing process.  In addition to incorporating design of                  experiments for quality improvement in IC manufacturing, the                    approach will be compared with some existing techniques in yield                modeling.",
