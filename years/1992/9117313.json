 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximately 60 billion lbs/year of synthetic polymers are                     produced in the U.S., in a wide variety of polymerization                       reactors.  The ultimate use of the products from these reactors                 ranges from synthetic clothing to latex paints.  Polymers are                   manufactured in batch, semibatch, and continuous reactors.                      Polymerization reaction engineering attempts to improve the                     production of polymers through innovations in process design and                control.  Three areas of importance include (1) a need to                       understand the dynamics of the reactors in which large heat                     release, high viscosity, and difficult heat removal contribute                  to difficulties in designing effective control mechanisms; (2)                  the development of continuous liquid and gas phase processes for                polyolefin (polyethylene, polypropylene, etc., - commodity                      polymers) production; and (3) developing new processes for                      polymers made by polycondensation (fibers and engineering                       plastics, for example are produced by this method).                                                                                                             The PI plans to continue experimental and theoretical research                  on batch, semibatch, and continuous polymerization reactors in                  order to develop an understanding of the chemical and physical                  phenomena occurring, and use this understanding to:                              (1) Devise improved reactor designs which provide better                            control control of polymer properties and also minimize                         difficult dynamics.  By quantitatively determining the                          ranges of operating conditions and system parameters for                        which oscillations and stability problems arise, design                         procedures can be developed which satisfy the polymer                           product specifications and have good economics but which                        avoid those parameter combinations that lead to difficult                       dynamic behavior.                                                           (2) Develop new types of on-line sensors for the reactor and                        polymer particles which allow closer quality control of                         the product and the combination of these new on-line                            polymer property sensors with feedback strategies to                            provide control schemes which lead to safe dynamic                              operation and close control of product quality.                             (3) Devise new reactor designs for existing and emerging                            classes of polymer products.",
