 "awd_abstract_narration": "State University of New York at Stony Brook will conduct a                      three-year project to enhance 40 science teachers, 40                           technology/engineering teachers, 20 mathematics teachers                        and 20 teacher-leaders (in the same ratio) to become more                       technologically literate and able to implement contextual                       learning experiences in their high school mathematics,                          science and engineering courses.                                                The study of technological systems and related engineering                      concepts will provide an approach to make science and                           mathematics more meaningful and attractive in high school                       education.  A tested and published \"Principles of                               Engineering\" syllabus for a one-year course using six                           relevant monographs of engineering case studies will be                         used as the main curriculum materials, supplemented by                          three video-based motivational and career exploration                           instructional packages.  A teacher implementation and                           resource guide will be developed concurrently with the                          project.  Teacher participants and leadership teams from                        sixteen states will be an integral part in generating,                          critiquing, testing and refining the guide edited and                           produced by the project staff of mathematicians,                                scientists, technologists, mathematics and science                              education specialists from SUNY Stony Brook; mathematics,                       science, and technology teachers from schools in New York.                                                                                                      Fifty classroom teachers from New York in the first year ,                      25 from New York and 25 total from five other states in the                     second year will in a three-week summer workshop experience                     classroom presentations and participate in hands-on                             laboratory experiences that broaden their backgrounds in                        technology/engineering, applied physics, biology, and                           chemistry, as well as mathematical topics of algebra,                           trigonometry, geometry, and discrete mathematics.  Both the                     university and school staff members will facilitate these                       learning activities. Pedagogical features include the                           teachers (a) learning how to use cooperative learning                           strategies in the \"Principles of Engineering\" course and                        (b) developing a constructivist approach to helping                             students learn mathematics, science, and technology. Five                       two-person leadership teams (one classroom teacher, one                         college/university/regional educator consultant) will join                      the classroom teachers for the third week of the summer                         workshop in each of the first two years, those ten teams                        joining ten new such teams from ten new states for a one-                       week workshop in the third summer to finish the guide and                       evaluation input. The regional groups of participant                            teachers and leadership teams will meet at the                                  college/university of the consultant on the leadership team                     to conduct follow-up activities during the school year.  An                     evaluation will monitor all program aspects including the                       effective use of project curriculum materials and                               pedagogical techniques in the classroom.                                                                                                                        SUNY at Stony Brook cost sharing accounts for 5.4% of the                       NSF budget contribution.",
