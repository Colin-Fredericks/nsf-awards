 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the most accurate predictions and simulations come                from primitive equation models, most of our physical insights into              atmospheric behavior come from \"balanced\" models, which represent               versions of the basic equations simplified through a number of                  approximations.  Recently, Dr. Schubert has made progress in                    formulating generalizations of the semi-geostrophic theory (a type              of balanced model theory) to include the full effects of the                    earth's sphericity.  The results open the possibility of extending              semi-geostrophic applications from synoptic scale to planetary                  scale phenomena.  An elegant aspect of the theory (when formulated              in combined isentropic and spherical geostrophic coordinates) is                its simple mathematical structure -  one prognostic equation for                potential vorticity and one diagnostic equation or invertibility                principle.  Under this award, Dr. Schubert will further develop and             apply this theory.                                                                   One weakness of the generalized semi-geostrophic theory is                 that highly curved flows are not properly simulated.  The principal             investigator hopes to be able to overcome this problem through the              use of a formulation (mathematically simple) which combines two                 special coordinate systems and a non-linear balance approximation.              He also will carry out simulations of midlatitude storm and                     tropical systems with several different types of models and                     systematically compare the results.",
