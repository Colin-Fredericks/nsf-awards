The Academic Year Program will              involve minority students from the College of Engineering at UT-                Austin.  The Summer Program will invite students from schools which             have a high predominance of minority groups enrolled, such as                   Prairie View A&M, Pan American, Texas A&I, UT San Antonio, UT El                Paso, and other campuses that have NSBE, SHPE, or SWE Chapters.                                                                                                 Students chosen for this Research Careers for Minority Scholars                 (RCMS) program will participate i state-of-the-art research under               faculty supervision and sponsored by industry or government.  These             students will meet weekly with faculty supervisors and bi-weekly as             a group to exchange information and ideas about the progress on                 their various projects during their semesters of participation in               the program.  The research work done by these engineering students              will allow them to receive three hours of research credit for                   participation in their RCMS program.  Successful conclusion of the              student's activity will include the writing and presentation of a               final technical report of the work that was performed.",
