 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the activities of a Research Experiences for                Undergraduates (REU) site in Flagstaff, Arizona, which will enable              eight to ten undergraduate students selected in a national                      competition to do astronomical research under the mentorship of                 professional scientists.  The research activities will take place               in Flagstaff during the summer months.  Under the direction of Dr.              Kathleen DeGioia Eastwood, the principal investigator, several                  organizations will be involved in this REU site:  Northern Arizona              University (NAU), the Lowell Observatory, the astrogeology branch               of the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Flagstaff station of the                 U.S. Naval Observatory.  Flagstaff is particularly well-suited as               an REU site since it is also the home of the National Undergraduate             Research Observatory (NURO), a nation-wide consortium of                        undergraduate schools dedicated to undergraduate research.                      Supplementing their research, students will also attend two lecture             series related to the science and techniques of astronomy, for                  which they will receive university credit.                                                                                                                      REU sites such as the one planned in Flagstaff are important in                 increasing the technical and scientific skills of the Nation's most             talented and motivated undergraduates, and in enabling those                    students to experience state-of-the-art scientific research before              they make their final career decisions.",
