 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glyoxysomes are specialized peroxisomes that contain enzymes                    critically required for the mobilization of lipids. To study                    processes involved in the biogenesis of the organelle, Dr. Harada               is investigating the regulation of genes encoding isocitrate                    lyase and malate synthase, two glyoxylate cycle enzymes that are                associated exclusively with glyoxysomes. The genes are regulated                developmentally; they are expressed in seedlings, developing                    seeds, senescent organs, and in pollen but not in non-senescent                 organs of the mature plant. Moreover, regulation of the genes                   occurs primarily at the transcriptional level. The proposal's                   long term goal is to define the physiological signals that                      regulate these genes, and, therefore, control glyoxysome                        biogenesis. An accompanying objective is to determine whether a                 common signal regulates these genes at different periods of the                 plant life cycle. Two primary approaches are proposed to address                these issues. First, Dr. Harada will localize cis-acting elements               and identify the DNA binding proteins that interact with these                  elements to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the regulation                of the genes. Second, he will identify mutants altered in the                   expression of the genes to begin to define components of the                    pathway regulating the genes. He anticipates that these                         complementary studies ultimately will provide insight into the                  physiological cues that control glyoxysome biogenesis.",
