 "awd_abstract_narration": "A crucial step in the sense of smell is that where odorous                      compounds first bind to the ciliary membranes of the receptor                   cells in the nose.  Biochemical research has revealed many of the               steps in this transduction, by which the binding of a molecule is               converted into a nerve signal carried to the brain.  However it                 is not yet clear exactly where and how the important binding                    proteins are localized in the membrane, nor when during                         development these proteins become incorporated to function                      properly.                                                                                                                                                       This project uses a variety of biochemical tagging techniques                   along with electron microscopy to reveal where and when during                  development several important classes of olfactory transduction                 proteins are expressed in the ciliary membranes.  These results                 will be correlated with the developmental timing of known                       electrophysiological and other cellular changes, to test                        predictions about the relation of membrane structures to                        function.  The findings will have an impact on chemosensory                     research, and on general neuroscience because of the similarity                 of olfactory binding processes to cell-cell communication.",
