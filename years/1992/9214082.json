Already                                                identified as a critical technology                                             of national importance, the MEMS                                                area is attracting the interest of                                              engineers and scientists in this                                                country.  Research in industry (very                                            little at present), government                                                  laboratories (starting), and                                                    universities is starting to grow as                                             evidenced by the ongoing work at the                                            University of California - Berkeley,                                            the University of Wisconsin, MIT,                                               Georgia Tech, and Cornell.  This                                                effort coupled with newly formed                                                research centers such as the Center                                             for Advanced Microstructures and                                                Devices (CAMD) at Louisiana State                                               University - Baton Rouge, and the                                               Institute for Micromanufacturing                                                (IfM) at Louisiana Tech University                                              will enable the United States to                                                keep pace with the burgeoning                                                   interest in Japan and Europe                                                    (particularly Germany).  The                                                    objective of this proposal is to                                                enhance the development of the MEMS                                             field in the university environment.                                            This will be accomplished by                                                    contacting all U.S. colleges of                                                 engineering and providing them with                                             an informational package on MEMS and                                            a copy of the Journal of                                                        Microelectromechanical Systems.
