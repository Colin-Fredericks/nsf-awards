 "awd_abstract_narration": "Educationally enhanced computer packages are being developed to                 greatly improve the learning experience of students taking                      first-year college physics laboratories.  Many of the packages                  can also be useable in high schools.  While current                             computerized laboratories provide excellent accuracy (and                       thereby support theory), they typically do not allow for or                     encourage extensive student participation, as did many earlier                  and simpler (but less accurate) lab methods.  The interactive                   software packages being developed in this research program are                  making use of animation, still and moving photographs and                       tutorials to help the student understand the laboratory                         procedures, methods of analysis and related theoretical                         concepts.  They also allow the student to retain control of the                 experimental procedure and data processing.  Pre-lab                            instructional units, often using complex and dynamic images,                    help the teacher to illustrate and explain some of the                          laboratory concepts that are difficult to present at the                        chalkboard.  The computer learning packages are being made                      compatible with as many of the existing commercial laboratory                   interfaces as possible.  Such packages will also be useful for                  many laboratory experiments in which the computer is not used                   to collect data.  The results of the investigation will be                      reported at national meetings and at a regional compatible                      conference.  The software developed will be made widely                         available at low cost.",
