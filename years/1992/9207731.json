 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three investigators, Wilkerson, Smith, and McClure, are                involved in three connected general investigations in homotopy                  theory.  A major goal of Wilkerson's research is to complete the                classification of finite loop spaces as a generalization of compact             Lie group theory.  The tools are function complexes and                         calculations with the Steenrod algebra going back to work of Adams-             Wilkerson, Miller, Carlsson, and Lannes.  Part of the work                      generalizes known facts about group actions and fixed points to                 homotopy fixed points.  Smith seeks an explicit construction of the             Morava K-theories.  These homology theories play a vital role in                the Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith nilpotence theorem.  Previous                        constructions rely on geometric techniques which are hard to                    interpret homotopically.  The resulting classifying spaces can                  really be constructed only \"up to homotopy,\" leaving many questions             about their nature open.  Finally, in joint work with S. Jackowski              and R. Oliver, McClure intends to try to find a simplified proof of             the immersion conjecture.  His other three problems all involve                 some aspect of the theory of topological Hochschild homology.                        The details of these three parts vary, but all are concerned               either with reducing geometric information to a subject for                     calculation or to perfecting one of the principal algebraic tools               used for this purpose.  The nature of the geometric information                 involved is the crux of the difficulty.  While questions about                  lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to              be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what are known             as topological properties of geometric objects.  These are                      properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),                      knottedness, having no holes, and so forth.  All systematic study               of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric              objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are              only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of                 differences that can occur, all these have only truly been                      comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of             calculation.",
