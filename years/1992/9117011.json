Many different types of pictures can be examined, including maps,               perspective views, pseudocolor imagery, shaded relief diagrams                  and                                                                             3-D stereograms. The raw data from which the views are created                  include bathymetry from multibeam and phase intererometric sonars               and backscatter from side-looking sonars. Using electronic                      communication over Internet, the users connect from their                       computer                                                                        (the server) into a client computer at Columbia University to                   begin                                                                           the visualization session. The client returns to the user with                  menus and dialog boxes for the purpose of selecting the display                 type, map boundaries, color tables, fonts, data files, etc..                    Moments later the representation appears in a window on the                     user's                                                                          screen with computations run in the client computer. The user,                  given a responsive, intuitive and interactive interface, is                     liberated from the chores of locating and maintaining large                     complex                                                                         databases and software code. The users find their work                          accelerated                                                                     by an immediate response to a query and by a greater depth of                   understanding from advanced graphic representations of very large               datasets.",
