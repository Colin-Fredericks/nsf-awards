Murray (NC A&T)                                                                                                                         SUCCEED has two primary goals: to improve the quality and relevance             of their degree programs; and to impact broadly engineering                     education in the 21st-century.  In pursuing these goals, they will              increase student retention, engineering enrollments and numbers of              SUCCEED graduates, while recruiting, retaining, and graduating more             women, minority, and handicapped student engineers.                                                                                                             SUCCEED's curriculum restructuring plan focuses on: integration of              all subjects with engineering design and practice; elimination of               course and infrastructure barriers to curriculum innovation; and                consideration of engineering as a process and a system.  SUCCEED's              management plan focuses on: instilling personal traits of                       innovation, teamwork, and leadership; and stimulating                           organizational traits leading to quality products, customer                     service, and an on-going product improvement process.  SUCCEED will             be organized as an experimental Engineering Education Management                System (EEMS) comprised of four distributed, multi-institutional                centers which will promote inter- and intra-institutional                       collaborations and establish an environment for exploring                       engineering education.  The four distributed centers are:  1)                   Center for Curriculum Development (University of Florida); 2)                   Center for Human Resource Development (Georgia Institute of                     Technology); 3) Center for Engineering Design and Processes (North              Carolina State University); and 4) Center for Information and                   Technology (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University).                                                                                               SUCCEED will achieve: an evaluation of a new engineering curriculum             blueprint called Curriculum-21; an increase in the total numbers                of female and minority students by 50% coalition-wide; an increase              in student retention by 50% and in four-year graduation rates by                a proportionate amount; an improvement in the number of students                pursuing graduate degrees; the promotion of math and science                    education in K-12; the promotion of basic technology literacy for               non-engineering graduates; and an improvement in the alternative                entry interface with community colleges and 2 and 4-year                        institutions.  In addition, SUCCEED will determine the                          prerequisites and guidelines for integrating principles and                     practices of Total Quality Management into the engineering                      curriculum, engineering management, and engineering processes.",
