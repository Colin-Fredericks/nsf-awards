 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most intriguing aspects of the geologic record of               global change is the role of orbital forcing in ice volume                      fluctuations.  While the variation in solar insolation resulting                from perturbations in the Earth's orbit are relatively small and                average out over the year, their effect on global ice volume is                 quite large.  The Miocene is an especially interesting period of                global change.  Early Miocene oceanic deep water temperatures were              much warmer than today.  The middle to late Miocene encompasses a               major transition toward conditions more like today.  Recent studies             indicate the mechanism linking Miocene deep water temperatures and              global ice volume were quite different from the late Pleistocene.               Collaborative research shall achieve an integrated, internally                  consistent interpretation regarding orbital forcing of Miocene                  eustasy and resulting sequence stratigraphy of the Baltimore Canyon             Trough and the Northwest Gulf of Mexico Basin.  Central to this                 undertaking is the STRATA-various computer program, which has been              developed specifically to perform two- and three-dimensional                    forward modeling of clastic sedimentation within the context of                 high-frequency glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations.  The Miocene              sequences of the Baltimore Canyon Trough and the Northwest Gulf of              Mexico Basin offer differing and complementary challenges and                   opportunities.  The former is a thinner section, offering better                resolution in higher frequency seismic data whereas the latter is               thicker, more complete, and has a higher density of well log                    information available.  Both sequences must be affected by the same             Miocene glacioeustasy.  Can stratigraphy be resolved down to the                10,000 year event level predicted by orbital forcing?  More precise             and quantitative solutions to stratigraphic problems shall create               the framework within which to document the geologic record of                   global change.",
