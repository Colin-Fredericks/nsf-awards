 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department at Mount Holyoke is expanding and                        upgrading experiments for two upper-level physics courses and                   one advanced laboratory course, with emphasis on the dramatic                   effects of fundamental quantum mechanics.  The new experiments                  are:  The Mossbauer Effect and Angular Polarization Correlation                 of Two Photon Annihilation Radiation (the Einstein, Podolsky                    Rosen paradox).  The experiments being upgraded are: Double                     Slit Photon Interference and Accelerator-Based Rutherford                       Scattering.  These experiments blend well with existing                         instrumentation and faculty expertise in the department, and                    with the modern physics course structure.  With these                           experiments students have opportunities to experimentally                       investigate and become intrigued by some of the most                            fundamental and counter-intuitive aspects of quantum theory.The                 major pieces of equipment provided by the grant that are needed                 to carry out these upgrades include:  1) a high vacuum turbo                    pumping system and a PC-based multichannel analyzer, both of                    which find many other uses within the Physics Department;  2)                   two radioactive sources Na-22 and Co-58;  and 3) some NIM                       electronics, the remainder to be supplied by the department.                    The turbo pump is being used to improve the Rutherford                          Scattering experiment.  The data analysis capability of the PC                  is being used in the Mossbauer experiment and in the double                     slit photon interference experiment.",
