 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in              mesoscale meteorology between Dale Durran of the University of                  Washington and Evelyne Richard and Phillipe Bougeault of the                    University Paul Sabatier in Toulouse, France.   The U.S. and                    French investigators have developed predictive models for air-flow              over mountains.  Although it has been recognized that mountains                 exert a significant influence on atmospheric circulations, existing             forecast models and global climate models contain deficiencies in               representing the effects of mountain geography on air circulation.              The specific objective of their cooperation is to increase                      understanding of the interaction between mountains and synoptic-                scale air circulation, with particular emphasis on gravity-wave                 drag.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigators need to better          understand the limitations of the current models and improve their              flexibility.                                                                                                                                                    Dr. Durran's nonhydrostatic model successfully simulates mountain               waves in a variety of regional environments, but has not been used              to simulate the interaction between gravity waves and larger scale              air flow.  The French investigators bring to this collaboration their           hydrostatic models for larger scale air flow.  Both models will be              to simulate real and idealized cross mountain flows.  Their                     investigations will be aided by unique observational data recently              collected in the Pyrenees region.  These complementary efforts will             result in models which are better able to predict the effect of                 gravity-wave drag and in turn, weather forecasting in mountainous               regions.",
