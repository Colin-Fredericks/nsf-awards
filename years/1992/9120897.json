 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteria are currently being evaluated as agents of                        bioremediation in improving the environment.  If bacteria bearing               genes which can detoxify toxic elements in the environment can                  survive in contaminated environments, these human hazardous                     elements can be eliminated efficiently and economically.  There is              considerable concern, however, about the fate of organisms used for             the purpose.  This project focuses on identifying genes and their               products which are linked to the survival and persistence of                    microbial organisms.  The model is soil pseudomonades in a soil                 environment, since pseudomonades are currently being considered for             release in to the environment and because genetics and genetic                  techniques are not well established and feasible in this organism.              The work aims to identify important traits which can be manipulated             (increased, decreased or inactivated) so as to control bacterial                survival.  Besides the practical applications of this work, the                 knowledge of those traits needed for bacterial survival and                     persistence will be of tremendous insight to bacterial ecologic                 systems elsewhere.",
