 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is centered on regulatory controls for DNA                   replication in the macronucleus of the heterotrich, Euplotes. DNA               replication in the macronucleus of this protozoan is highly                     localized into an easily-visualized replication band. The primary               working hypothesis is that posttranslational modifications of                   specific histones are required for both the activation and                      inactivation of the replication process. The experiments focus on               the phosphorylation of histone H1 at specific residues as necessary             facets of both activation and inactivation of replication.                      Acetylation of histones H3 and H4 may also be important regulatory              steps in the process. Replication origins will be sought in the                 telomeric regions of the chromosomes. These experiments will                    contribute to our overall understanding of DNA replication.                                                                                                     The replication of DNA in eukaryotic cells is usually initiated at              multiple sites along each of the chromosomes. Euplotes is a                     protozoan that exhibits an unusual level of spatial order in the                pattern of DNA replication in its macronucleus, where all                       replication occurs in a small region. This high order in the                    replication pattern makes this organism particularly amenable for               studies of the process. In this study, experiments are focused on               regulatory aspects of DNA replication. Experiments will test                    whether the phosphorylation and acetylation of specific histones,               at specific sites are controlling factors in the replication                    process. Other experiments are directed at testing whether the                  replication origins reside exclusively at the telomeric ends of the             chromosomes. This proposal will contribute to our overall                       understanding of DNA replication.",
