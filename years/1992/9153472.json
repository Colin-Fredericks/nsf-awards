 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of South Florida's \"YES - WE CARE|\" program,                   started in 1983, increases suitably prepared and motivated                      minority high school graduates for studies of science and                       engineering.  The University currently operates four centers,                   the last started in January 1991.  In this 30 week Saturday                     morning academic enrichment program, 6th through 12th grade                     minority students receive mathematics, science, computers, and                  engineering projects instruction from certified teachers and                    \"role model\" volunteer minority engineers.  The program is a                    community effort involving the University, county school boards,                industry, and the minority community.  In early 1990 the program                was selected to be one of Florida's \"Programs of Excellence\" (\"a                program ... that could be promoted...statewide.\")  \"YES - WE                    CARE|\" was conceived to operate de-centralized with minimal                     administrative hierarchy.  In October 1990 the enrollment was                   137 students.  To realize the full growth potential of the                      program (higher retention rate and expansion to new communities)                is requiring one-time efforts to strengthen instructional                       materials, develop proper diagnostic tests, provide additional                  teacher training, document the program's operation, and improve                 public relations and parental and community involvement.  The                   NSF award is allowing for the implementation of these                           improvements.",
