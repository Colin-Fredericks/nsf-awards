The meeting will be held in Colorado Springs, Colorado                during September, 1992. Participants will include Commission                    members, U.S. leaders in science education and invited                          science\\biology teachers. Previous to the conference, Commission                members will prepare papers describing standards for biology\\life               sciences that have been adopted in their countries. They will                   define, from their country's perspective, what students should                  know and be able to do (K-12) and describe the extent to which                  these goals are being attained. This meeting will provide a                     unique opportunity to explore the essential elements of biology                 curriculum from a world-wide perspective and will augment the                   work of the National Research Council's National Committee on                   Science Education Standards and Assessment. Proceedings of the                  symposium will be developed, published, and distributed.
