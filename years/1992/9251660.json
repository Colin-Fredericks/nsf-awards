 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel processing is now a significant component of large                     computation, and it will become increasingly so in the future.                    This project is directed at giving students a hands-on                        environment in which they can grasp the issues involved with                    the several models for parallel computation, via the use of                     transputer hardware.  These issues will be studied both via the                 language OCCAM and through use of a parallel-C compiler.The                     plan is to introduce one new course devoted to parallelism per                  se, a second new course devoted to development and analysis of                  parallel algorithms, and a third new course--in computer                        graphics, but taking full advantage of the parallel computing                   facilities.  This latter course will provide applications of                    the power of parallelism.  Equally as important, it will                        resolve the computational near-impasse that students sometimes                  encounter when trying to apply techniques of three-dimensional                  graphics and image processing.It is expected that the impact of                 this facility will not be restricted to these new courses, but                  will also influence in varying degrees nine existing upper-                     division courses.",
