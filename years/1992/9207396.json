 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative                          research project between Dr. Julianna Kardos of the                             Central Research Institute for Chemistry, Budapest and Dr.                      Derek Cash, University of Missouri, Columia is to use fast                      kinetic technique for the analysis of transmembrane ion                         fluxes mediated by the ion-channel forming                                      neurotransmitter receptor such as gamma-aminobutyric acid                       (GABA).  Determining the relationship between the binding                       reaction and the GABA receptor-controlled 36CL -ion fluxes                      requires the techniqus of rapid mixing because - due to                         rapid desensitization of receptor on exposure to GABA -                         the translocation process is complete within a few hundred                      milliseconds.                                                                                                                                                   For the existing fast reacting techniques, Dr. Kardos                           plans to explore the versatile quenched flow machine                            developed by Dr. Cash and is now constructing the machine                       in his laboratory.  The project development visit by Prof.                      Cash would focus on extending their previous work on the                        GABA receptor to drugs which effect its function using a                        preparation enriched in GABA receptors.                                                                                                                         Funds for this project are awarded through the US-Hungary                       Joint Fund, Budapest in accordance with established                             guidelines.",
