 "awd_abstract_narration": "This four year project takes advantage of a collaborative                       association between the University of New Hampshire and four                    schools from quite different communities, and is designed to                    enhance middle school math and science teachers' conceptual                     base in mathematics and science, pedagogical skills,                            laboratory/ activity learning and scientific thinking.                          Twenty-four lead teachers from these four schools will                          participate in three 3-week summer institutes and academic                      year activities including 10 days/ year of inservice.                           Additional activities, focusing more on strengthening and                       practicing leadership skills, are planned for the fourth and                    final year of the project.  As the project progresses,                          participants will begin to provide inservice to colleagues                      within their own and neighboring schools, and will serve as                     Master Teachers to preservice teachers in middle school                         mathematics and science education.                                                                                                                              A unique feature of this project is a one-week course                           designed to acquaint university mathematics and science                         faculty instructors with interactive teaching methods,                          adolescent development, and discovery-oriented laboratory                       sessions, and to involve them in classroom observations and                     exchanges with two middle school Master Teachers who, along                     with teacher education faculty, will serve as instructors                       for this course.  Subsequently, these mathematics and                           science faculty instructors will be extensively involved in                     the summer institutes and follow-up support of participants                     during the academic year.                                                                                                                                       This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because                    it  is an innovative project which will provide leadership                      training and extensive inservice to middle school teachers                      of mathematics and science.                                                                                                                                     The cost-sharing amount is approximately 29% of the amount                      requested from NSF.",
