 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Chemical Education of the American Chemical Society             established a Task Force to study the General Chemistry curriculum              in the Fall of 1989.  It has met four times as a body, held two                 public sessions, and presented a full-day symposium at the 1991 ACS             meeting.  FIPSE supported four lectures by Task Force members on                revising general chemistry that were part of the symposium, and NSF             supported a two-day workshop of the Task Force in August 1991.  As              a result of the workshop, the Task Force has appointed three new                subgroups and expanded its membership to include a fuller                       representation of the research community.  One subgroup is                      explicitly charged with recommending administrative reorganization              of the Task Force and its relationship to the disciplinary                      community.  Other subgroups focus on:  studying innovations in                  general chemistry across the country; building general chemistry                curriculum form a base of zero; a laboratory-based curriculum; a                modular/core approach; and a curriculum drawn conceptually from                 important applications of chemistry.  During the 1992-93 period the             Task Force will continue its efforts to recognize the key elements,             approaches, personnel, and organization of national reform of                   general chemistry instruction.  It will also continue to plan                   proposals seeking major support of the Task Force to initiate                   large-scale changes in general chemistry instruction.",
