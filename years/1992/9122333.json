 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, Robert Dunbar of Case Western                        Reserve University will study the properties of gas-phase ions                  interacting with laser light using an ion cyclotron resonance                   ion trap.  \"Medium-to-large\" hydrocarbons, organometallic                       compounds, clusters, and complex ions are targets for study.                    Time-resolved photodissociation kinetics, measurement of                        radiative cooling rates of excited ions, infrared multiphoton                   dissociation kinetics, the determination of radiative                           association efficiencies and of partitioning of vibrational                     energy in the products of complex ion dissociation will all be                  examined.  The temperature dependence of some of these                          processes will be determined using an ion trap cooled to 77 K.                  Theoretical studies will be conducted dealing with infrared                     multiphoton dissociation and radiative association in                           conjunction with an expert versed in statistical mechanics.                     %%%                                                                             The development of the technique known as Ion Cyclotron                         Resonance Spectroscopy has enabled scientists to trap                           electrically charged atoms or molecules, known as ions, for                     relatively long times, on the order of seconds or longer.  With                 such long storage times, various processes involving ions which                 last up to seconds in time can now be studied more easily.                      Examples of such processes include the breakup of an ion after                  the absorption of light with just enough energy to sever the                    bonds between atoms (near-threshold photodissociation) and the                  emission of infrared radiation.  Professor Dunbar's work will                   allow him to study several of these \"slow\" chemical processes                   for a variety of fairly large molecular ions.",
