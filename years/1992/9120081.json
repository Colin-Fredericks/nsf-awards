 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of nine U.S. scientists               in a joint seminar on Molecular Evolution to be held in early                   December 1992 on the campus of the Forest Research Institute at                 Rotorua, New Zealand.  Participation of the New Zealand                         scientists is supported through the Ministry of Research, Science               and Technology.  The New Zealand Journal of Botany will publish                 the seminar proceedings.  Organization of the seminar is being                  conducted by Dr. Michael T. Clegg from the University of                        California at Riverside and Dr. Bruce S. Weir from North Carolina               State University on the U.S. side, and by Dr. Michael Hendy and                 Dr. David Penny from Massey University in New Zealand.                                                                                                          Many sets of DNA sequences of the same gene from different plant                taxa are now available.  Evolutionary comparisons of homologous                 sequences provide a powerful means of resolving functionally                    important regions such as the sequence motifs in chloroplast gene               regions.  Once such motifs are identified, the relationship to                  gene or protein function can be further explored with mutagenesis               experiments.  Research in both theoretical and plant molecular                  evolution has been pursued in the U.S. and New Zealand and it now               seems appropriate for some combining of forces to benefit both                  communities.  The speakers will describe their current work in                  molecular evolution.  The plant scientists will gain from                       learning of new techniques for modelling evolution and analyzing                data, while  the theorists will learn of biological advances that               require model or methodology development.  The central theme of                 the seminar will be that of managing and using molecular data for               a study of plant evolution.  The organizers believe the seminar                 will act as a foundation for future long-term collaborations.",
