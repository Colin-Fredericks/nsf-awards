 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Delaware will conduct a four-year project                     to enhance 230 mathematics teachers and administrators of                       grades 7 through 9 in making mathematical connections, in                       problem solving, and in reasoning and communicating about                       mathematics.  The focus of participants' mathematical                           experiences will be situation-centered mathematics tasks                        conducted in a technologically rich learning environment.                       Teacher involvement will use the teacher-as-learner and                         teacher-as-researcher models.                                                                                                                                   Teacher participants will be expected to attend at least                        two  three-week summer workshops, with administrators                           attending at least one day per summer of these workshops to                     understand the spirit of the models being used.                                 Mathematics content focus will be on combinatorics and                          probability (1991 pilot), functions and statistics (1992),                      geometry and discrete mathematics (1993),  summarizing,                         organizing into Standards curricula for grades 7 through 9,                     and leadership training (1994), and leadership and                              dissemination (1995).  During the school year, weekly two-                      hour after school meetings will be held in each district                        where the previous summer workshop participants will coach                      their colleagues, new lessons will be piloted, and                              curricula planned.                                                              In addition, monthly three-hour workshops will be held                          where project staff will extend and clarify summer                              material.  Lastly, project staff will visit schools twice                       per week.                                                                                                                                                       The project includes a collaborative learning component for                     administrators where they will consider basic leadership                        tasks needed to facilitate change.  The project  will also                      involve substantial collaboration with 8 of Delaware's 16                       public school districts.  Thorough dissemination of the                         program's features and implementation strategies for                            replicating the project will be undertaken in the remaining                     8 districts and the 3 vocational-technical districts in                         Delaware.  The project is endorsed by the Delaware State                        Systemic Initiatives Project 21.  University of Delaware                        and school district cost-sharing accounts for 37% of the                        NSF budget.                                                                                                                                                     The project is well-planned, employing methodology                              suggested by current research in the teaching and learning                      of mathematics, and is systemic in nature.  It addresses                        the many facets of the educational system needed to insure                      change in the classroom.",
