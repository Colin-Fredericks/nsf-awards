 "awd_abstract_narration": "This infrastructure award is for the acquisition of                        equipment to support research in distributed and parallel                       computing.  The equipment consists of a network of workstations                 to support distributed processing research and an upgrade to an                 existing SIMD computer.  The research supported includes the                    evaluation of parallel random access algorithms, numerical                      algorithms for modeling the flow of particles through a host                    medium, sequence planning for manufacturing, fault tolerance and                load balancing in distributed networks, dynamic hard real time                  applications in a distributed environment, designing distributed                real time intelligent systems, and the development of a wide area               distributed robotics network.                                                                                                                                        The future increases in raw computational power will come                  from the utilization of many processors to work on computational                problems.  There are many research problems associated with the                 effective utilization of many processors.  These range from how                 the processors should communicate to the development of new                     algorithms to take advantage of multiple processors.  Texas A&M                 University is building up a parallel computer laboratory and a                  distributed computer laboratory to perform experimental research                on these issues.",
