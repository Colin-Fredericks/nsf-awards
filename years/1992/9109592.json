 "awd_abstract_narration": "Filament winding is an efficient method for manufacturing                  large, high-performance composite shells and structures.  The                   research will investigate the use of infrared heating to                        continuously-cure filament-wound composite structures as they are               being wound onto a mandrel or preform.  Fundamental to proving the              viability of this novel process is understanding the radiative heat             transfer upon the winding's surface and its affect upon the resin's             cure kinetics, optical characteristics, and mechanical properties.              To this end, these characteristics will be measured and a thermo-               mechanical model will be developed to describe the concurrent                   winding-curing process.  \"Proof-of-Principle\" experiments will be               conducted using pilot-scale infrared oven with thermal imaging                  equipment with a bench-scale filament-winder.                                        Comparisons will be made as to the efficiency of continuous                curing versus batch curing.  In the event that manufacturers are                interested in commercializing this technology, process procedures               and design guidelines will be developed.",
