 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Desert Botanical Garden will utilize its extensive                          collection to create a science learning center focusing on                      deserts and presenting fundamental science concepts applicable                  to all environments.  The comprehensive desert exhibit created                  by this proposal will feature six thematic trails through 25                    acres of the Garden, with the trails' themes ranging from basic                 characteristics of deserts to adaptions of plants, animals, and                 people to the desert.  Emphasizing ecology and conversation, the                trails will include conceptual signs, investigation stations for                hands-on, interactive learning, and innovative written                          exploration guides.                                                                                                                                             The proposal also includes educational programming which will                   extend the exhibit and encourage use of the Garden as an outdoor                laboratory.  An exhibit-based curriculum will be developed for                  use across the state, and an institute will be created to                       prepare teachers to use the exhibit and curriculum.  A newspaper                series focusing on key exhibit concepts will be disseminated                    across the state to reach out-of-school adults.  The products of                the proposal and the model created will be shred through various                networks with a national audience.                                                                                                                              The local and worldwide population explosion in arid lands                      mandates an increased understanding of deserts.  With this                      proposal, the Garden will be a catalyst for greater awareness                   and change.",
