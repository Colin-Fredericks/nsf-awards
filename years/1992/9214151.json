The inorganic chemistry that                 occurs between the time that the platinum salt is placed in contact             with the zeolite and the formation of the final platinum particle               is investigated using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)                    followed by observations of X-ray absorption (chemical shift and                near-edge structure \u0131XANES!) and hydrogen consumption; the                      structures of the platinum species before initiation of TPR, at                 stages during, and after complete reduction to platinum metal                   determined by extended X-ray absorption catalytic reaction probes               (neopentane isomerization and u-hexane aromatization), and X-ray                absorption are used to investigate destabilization of small                     platinum particles in zeolite L, including particle growth,                     deactivation by hydrocarbon residue during reaction, sulfur                     poisoning, and sulfur-promoted migration.                                                                                                                       Platinum in zeolite L is one of the fastest-growing catalysts in                volume.  It has valuable applications in the chemical and petroleum             industries.  Its principal use is in the upgrading of heavy crudes              to high-octave gasoline, although it has other applications in                  chemical synthesis and environmental control as well.",
