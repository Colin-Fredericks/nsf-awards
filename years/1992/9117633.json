 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research on the energetics of the adults and larvae of the                 Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is focused on quantification                of the role of ice biota in winter-over survival of krill larvae.               Observed interannual differences in physiological condition of                  the larvae during the winter could lead to differences in                       survival of the young-of-the-year, and thus in the strength of                  any one year class.  Processes underlying such differences during               early and late winter will be studied.  Low food availability in                the fall after the summer phytoplankton blooms suggests that                    larvae in early winter will have experienced several months of                  near starvation conditions.  Without an additional food source                  such as ice biota in the underside of the sea ice these larvae                  may not survive the winter.  However, larvae under the ice in                   late winter of a heavy ice year will have had this additional                   food source, and may be in better physiological condition than                  the beginning of the winter.  Environmental conditions in open                  water and under ice will be compared and will be sampled to                     determine their physiological condition.  The nutritional                       contribution of the ice biota to total energy demand of the                     larvae on two month-long cruises to the Southern Ocean will be                  quantified.  The proposed research will address several                         significant questions about the winter-over energetics of larval                krill, in particular the role of ice biota in winter-over                       survival and subsequent recruitment.",
