 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation introduces a new concept, fish growth                   rate potential, which is derived from the integration of                        spatially articulated field data on prey sizes, prey density                    and the physical environment with a species-specific                            physiological-based model of fish growth rate.  The approach                    combines the strengths of bioacoustics to measure fish density                  and size quantitatively and of bioenergetics models to                          accurately simulate fish growth.  The result is a two-                          dimensional, nonlinear biophysical model of fish growth and                     system production.  This research will develop the growth rate                  potential parameter mathematically and evaluate the                             sensitivity and spatial statistics of fish growth rate                          potential on a diel and seasonal basis assuming different                       ecological hypotheses on predator behavior (optimal foraging,                   thermoregulation, behavioral bioenergetics).  The Chesapeake                    Bay will be used as a study site because of the availability of                 an extensive database well-suited for these analyses.  Since                    growth rate potential links biology and physics within a                        spatially-explicit framework, it has widespread application for                 predicting how changes in the patterning or absolute scaling of                 the environment might affect production dynamics of higher                      trophic levels.  It is anticipated that the concept of growth                   rate potential will evolve and provide a stimulus for the                       development of conceptual analogs.",
