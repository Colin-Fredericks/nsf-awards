Kollman of the School of Pharmacy, University of                       California, San Francisco Center, and Dr. Piotr Cieplak of the                  University of Warsaw, Poland, is to carry out theoretical                       calculations to design peptide analogs that have the potential to be            excellent inhibitors of the proteins HIV protease, thermolysin and              elastase.  The successful design of an inhibitor for this enzyme,               should it prove of therapeutic value, could be used against the                 AIDS virus.  The same type of design could be transferred to the                inhibitor of other aspartyl proteases such as renin, which would                provide therapy against hypertension.  Selective inhibition of serine           proteases such as human leucocyte elastase as a potential drug                  against emphysema or other such degenerative diseases might be                  achieved using the same principles.                                                                                                                             This project in biophysics fulfills the program objective of                    advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the               United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                       talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and               competence.",
