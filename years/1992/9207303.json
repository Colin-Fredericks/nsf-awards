 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many fundamental aspects of leaf development and pattern formation              in plants are poorly understood.  This research will use a species              of aquatic plants to study the development of two specific tissue               types - stomata and lateral veins (i.e. vascular tissue) - in                   leaves.  This plant possesses unique advantages for this research               because the two tissue types are normally absent on submerged plant             leaves, but they can be induced to differentiate on plants exposed              to the plant growth regulator abscisic acid (ABA).   Thus, this                 system presents an opportunity to study alternative modes of                    development against a uniform genetic background.  The proposed                 research will examine the relationship between microtubule                      orientation and ABA-induced stomatal development using a                        combination of immunofluorescence microscopy and microtubule-                   disrupting drugs.  ABA-induced vascular development will be studied             through a combination of experiments.  Finally, a fundamental study             will be a made of the relationship of ABA to cell division rates                in developing Hippuris leaves.  Results obtained from this research             will increase understanding of stomatal and vascular development                both in Hippuris vulgaris specifically and in plants in general.
