 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine the emerging uses of computer-mediated               communication technologies by American Indians and the subsequent               cultural changes associated with them.  The researcher will study               two on-line communities which have been identified as having                    significant American Indian populations; the Electronic Native                  American Network (ENAN) and NATIVEnet.  ENAN is an on-line                      computer network which serves Indian children and tribal                        educators from across the United States.  Funded by the Bureau of               Indian Affairs, ENAN resides on a desk-top computer at the                      University of New Mexico and is accessed by four toll free                      telephone lines.  NATIVEnet is a \"news-group\" (list-serv)                       residing on the NSF-funded INTERNET.  It connects American                      Indians and scholars interested in indigenous issues from around                the world.  These two networks will be studied using theorems                   from convergence and network theory which have a bearing on                     intercultural communication and cultural change.  Techniques used               in data collection will include the experimental construction of                sociograms of the networked interpersonal relationships, content                analysis of several years of on-line discussions, and                           ethnographic data derived from participant observation.  Results                will contribute to the development of network theory, as applied                to intercultural computer-mediated communication, and to                        understanding the relationships of information and network social               policy to cultural change.  Results will be disseminated to                     relevant Indian organizations, tribal leaders, and appropriate                  scientific journals.",
