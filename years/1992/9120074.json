 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for continued support of an interdisciplinary                     research program on problems of coordination. The research began                in 1989 when the Principal Investigators were successful                        competitors in the first NSF Special Initiative on Coordination                 Theory and Technology. The Principal Investigators' disciplines                 are Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Economics and                     Operations Research.  Some of the problems under study are                      primarily theoretical; some of them require computational                       experimentation; and some of them model the tasks of real                       organizations.  The problems may be viewed in the following way:                a designer is given a organization-a group of persons/processors                each of whom has private information about some aspect of the                   organization's changing environment.  The organization's task is                to compute a specified function of its current environment; often               the value computed can be interpreted as an ACTION that is the                  organization's desired response to its environment.  The designer               has to construct a MECHANISM (sometimes called a \"protocol\")                    which (1) tells each person/processor what to do (what                          computations to perform, what messages to send to whom) at each                 of a sequence of steps, and (2) achieves the task when the                      sequence stops.  The designer wants the mechanism to be quick and               cheap-according to several interesting cost measures-as compared                to the other mechanisms that also achieve the task.  The                        investigators also conduct an interdisciplinary Seminar on                      problems of coordination-in which the investigators, graduate                   students and visitors take part.  The investigators also guide                  dissertations on coordination problems which often take                         interdisciplinary approach.",
