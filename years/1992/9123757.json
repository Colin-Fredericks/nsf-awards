 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuing research on the mathematical theory of inverse                  problems in partial differential equations will be supported by                 this award.  The principal mathematical ingredient of the work is               the so-called Dirichlet to Neumann map: The boundary values of a                partial differential equation are given, the solution is                        established and its normal derivative at the boundary is then                   given.  The relationship between the boundary values and the                    normal derivative is  established.  One of the primary issues                   concerns the invertibility of the map and the regularity of the                 inverse when it does exist.  In the physical world it is often                  much easier to measure the normal derivative - flux - than to                   know much about the boundary values or the values of the solution               within its region of definition.  This type of problem occurs in                impedance tomography where one attempts to measure internal                     resistivity in a body from measurements of voltage and current at               the boundary.                                                                        Progress to date includes a variety of necessary conditions                for invertibility, but no good sufficient conditions are                        available without the presence of symmetry assumptions.  Better                 results have been achieved in dimensions greater than two.  The                 two dimensional tomography problem and anisotropic cases (which                 can occur in geophysics) are important challenges.",
