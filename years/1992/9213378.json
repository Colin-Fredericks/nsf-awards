 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soil erosion models have become an essential tool for soil                 conservation planning and design and for a variety of other land                management and assessment tasks.  Modern soil erosion models are                process based, and virtually all of them contain a formula for                  predicting sediment transport capacity, as transport capacity                   controls both rate of erosion and rate of deposition.  Although                 all hillslopes have irregular surfaces, no existing formula is                  capable of accurately predicting the transport capacity of                      overland flow on such surfaces.  There is an urgent need for                    development of such a formula.  This project will develop                       sediment transport formulas for stone covered and grass covered                 surfaces as a first step toward development of a more general                   formula for all irregular surfaces.  The research will be based                 on two sets of flume experiments in the laboratory.  Cylinders                  will be used to simulate stones and nails will simulate grass.                  Experiments will be performed in a six meter long flume using a                 variety of water discharges, gradients, grain sizes, and cylinder               and nail concentrations.  The analysis will establish empirical                 relations between transport capacity and appropriate hydraulic                  variables that reflect the energy dissipated near the bed and                   available to transport sediment.                                                     The ability of process-based soil erosion models to provide                accurate predictions of soil erosion is dependent on the accuracy               of the transport capacity equation they employ.  This research                  should produce formulas for stone and grass covered surfaces                    which can be incorporated immediately into existing soil erosion                models.  Use of these formulas should lead to more accurate                     estimates of sediment transport capacity and thus better                        predictions of soil erosion rates on irregular surfaces.",
