 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental aspect of the complexity of modern science is                     the existence of multiple levels of abstraction embedding                       multiple layers of meaning and representation.  This deep                       structure permeates virtually all areas of biology -                            developmental biology, physiology, anatomy, and genetics.                       Genetics, in particular, considers DNA, genes, chromosomes,                     individual organisms, kin, and populations.  Behavior at                        each level is, in important ways, the functional consequence                    of processes that take place at lower levels.  The                              overarching conceptual framework for this project is the                        inherent multi-level scale of genetic phenomena.  We plan,                      through the use of advanced technology, to model this                           conceptual framework and to investigate its implications for                    the learning and teaching of genetics.  We have chosen the                      subject of genetics as our initial area of focus for several                    reasons: it embodies a rich multi-level structure which                         lends itself perfectly to investigating the research issues;                    the dramatic advances in the science of genetics and                            genetics technology have important consequences for                             individuals and society; it is a rapidly changing area of                       enormous scientific interest in its own right; and it                           presents extraordinary difficulties to learning and                             teaching.  We plan to develop GenScope, an interactive                          computer environment that presents the linked multi-level                       processes of genetics visually, dynamically, and in ways                        that make explicit the casual connections and interactions                      between them.  The primary thrust of our project will be to                     investigate the educational use and benefits from student                       work with this environment, complemented by laboratory and                      classroom activities.  Our hypothesis is that students will                     acquire a deeper understanding of the fundamental ideas,                        subsuming and spanning molecular, individual, and population                    genetics.",
