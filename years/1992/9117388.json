 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of Dr. Spergel's project is to synthesize the growing body             of observational data that suggests that our Galaxy, the Milky Way,             has significant non-axisymmetric structure.  Improvements in                    infrared technology have enabled astronomers to observe the                     galactic center at wavelengths not obscured by dust.  These                     observations suggest that our Galaxy is barred.  Radio wavelength               surveys of gas motions in our Galaxy reveal significant non-                    circular motions that are likely due to this bar.  Dr. Spergel                  plans to develop analytical and numerical techniques to construct               a three-dimensional model of the Milky Way that is consistent with              the observations.  Improvements in our understanding of orbital                 dynamics in triaxial systems as well as improvements in numerical               techniques and computer hardware will facilitate this study.  Dr.               Spergel also plans to study the dynamics of corrugation waves and               spiral density waves excited by the bar and the galactic spheroid               and to explore how these waves alter gas motions in the Galaxy.                 Ultimately the goal of this research is to better understand the                morphology and dynamics of the Milky Way and to provide insight                 into its origin and evolution.",
