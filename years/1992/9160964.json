 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of marine biofouling is very                                        important, and one to which extensive efforts                                   have been expended in order to find materials                                   that will prevent such fouling.  The                                            diversity and adaptability of marine                                            organisms is simultaneously impressive and                                      depressing.  It is sobering to consider the                                     facts that marine organisms will attach to                                      and colonize fluorinated polymer surfaces,                                      such as Teflon, albeit not as tenaciously as                                    to other materials, and that the pholad                                         Martesia has been observed to attack as inert                                   a polymer as polyethylene.                                                                                                                                      This research program involves a waterborne                                     polymeric formulation which promises to                                         significantly advance the state of the art of                                   non-toxic antifouling paints.  The novel                                        composition contains no toxic ingredients or                                    volatile organic compounds (VOC).  The                                          proposed technology is also attractive since                                    it involves only environmentally benign                                         components, will be easy to apply, and will                                     be of low cost.",
