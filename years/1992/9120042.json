 "awd_abstract_narration": "The greatest challenge facing theoretical physicists                       today is to construct a consistent and useful quantum theory                    of gravity.  Only when such a theory is available can one                       begin to determine, with confidence, the nature of the cosmos                   in its earliest moments, when it was less than 10_43 seconds                    old.  The reason these moments are important is that the                        violent fluctuations in the geometry of spacetime that were                     then taking place must have had a strong influence on all the                   other violent processes that were going on simultaneously (the                  Big Bang) and hence on the subsequent evolution of the                          Universe.                                                                            Preliminary computer investigations have already been                      carried out on a simplified model (known as the O(1,2) sigma                    model) that shares some of the significant features of quantum                  gravity.  These investigations will be completed and work will                  be begun on the quantized gravitational field itself.",
