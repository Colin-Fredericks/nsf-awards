 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project of a cultural anthropologist                 studies how households use over-the-counter (\"non-prescription\")                medications.  The student will select a sample of households with               young children in Tucson, Arizona, which vary on their access to                health-care insurance.  The project will study how mothers obtain               information about non-prescription drugs, and hypothesizes that                 uninsured households will rely on OTC medications more than                     insured households.  A sample of 40 uninsured and 20 insured                    households will be studied over a year to track the illness                     episodes.  Pharmacists will be interviewed about their provision                of information to customers.                                                                                                                                    This project is important because the trend in recent years has                 been to decontrol many previously prescription-only medications.                Given the current concern about health care and insurance in our                society, this sort of in-depth study of a sample of families will               provide valuable information to policy makers about their                       situation.",
