 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agler will continue his development of a very general                      extension theory for operators on Hilbert spaces that would apply               to many classes of operators including subnormal operators,                     n-symmetric operators, and m-isometries.  This will require first               identifying the class of extensions that would go with a given                  operator, finding a good model theory for the extension, and                    finally applying the construction to prove new theorems.                        Progress on these problems will be of interest to many parts of                 analysis.                                                                            Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the               infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,               when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has                the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                   matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                  operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                    associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                      underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,               and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.",
