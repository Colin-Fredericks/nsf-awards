 "awd_abstract_narration": "Widespread concern about global competition in manufacturing               has led to an increasing need for better, more detailed                         coordination to improve the performance of manufacturing                        operations.  The research will examine these issues in three                    different ways.                                                                      First, the research will expand upon a line of research that               addresses coordination among the various stages of production                   within a single manufacturing facility.  Research in this area will             focus on the planning and control of systems whose elements have                become more tightly coupled because of inventory reductions                     resulting from the adoption of just-in-time policies.  These                    inventory reductions have created significant challenges to meeting             production goals and deadlines, especially in fabrication-assembly              systems.  In such systems, many parts must be produced or procured              in a carefully orchestrated manner to ensure that the parts can be              mated in the correct proportions, so that production goals are met.                  Second, the research will investigate coordination issues                  among distinct manufacturing facilities building on recent work on              establishing supplier delivery schedules and related transportation             contracts.  A key factor is how each customer's ordering pattern                affects the costs of production at the supplier, and how to define              ordering policies (at the customers), and, where applicable, order              acceptance or delivery date setting policies (at the suppliers)                 which are mutually beneficial to all parties.                                        Third, the research will concentrate on coordination issues                at the interface between manufacturing functions which                          traditionally have been dealt with separately, both in industry and             in the academic literature.  Although some of the past research                 lies in these interfaces (e.g., the interface between production                scheduling and transportation logistics, the interface between                  quality control and production control), the research will focus                on the interfaces between operational and tactical control topics               and those dealing with capital investment decisions.  It is not                 well understood how operational policies affect the realized                    capacity of existing manufacturing systems, nor how they should                 influence choices for new systems.  Similarly, it is not well                   understood how the physical characteristics of existing or proposed             manufacturing systems affect the development of good, simple,                   operational controls.                                                                Analytical models will be developed, some descriptive and                  others optimization-based.  The models will consider different                  levels of information availability (relative to both speed and                  detail) and practical performance evaluation methods.  This also                will allow assessment of the value of better information systems                and well-designed incentive policies where coordination is                      important in achieving improved manufacturing performance.",
