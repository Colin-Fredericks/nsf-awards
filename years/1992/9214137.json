 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spontaneous mutation rates have been assumed to be constant and                 uninfluenced by selective forces.  Recent experiments have shown,               however, that when stationary cells of Escherichia coli are                     subjected to certain non-lethal selections, mutants appear with                 time.  Because the only mutants that accumulate among the                       population are those that are selected for this phenomenon has come             to be known as \"directed\" or \"adaptive\" mutation.  This phenomenon              is not due to obvious artifacts and is under genetic control.  This             research will investigate the cellular process that give rise to                \"directed\" mutations.  Using a well-defined mutational assay, the               involvement of recombination, DNA synthesis, and various DNA repair             pathways will be investigated.  New genetic defects affecting the               process will be isolated.  That populations are able to increase                their variability under stress without deleterious genetics                     consequences has clear evolutionary significance.                               %%%                                                                             Understanding the mechanism by which this is accomplished may lead              to new insights into the regulation of genetic processes and how                they may be influenced by the physiology of nutritionally-deprived              cells.",
