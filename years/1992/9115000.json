The goal of this WOCE                       long-lead time development program was to improve the                           accuracy, reliability and availability of meteorological                        and air-sea flux measurements made over extended time                           periods from ships and buoys.  A major focus of the program                     was to improve the sensors used for these measurements,                         evaluate their accuracy, and reduce errors in making those                      measurements.  Improved sensors have resulted for                               barometric pressure, precipitation, humidity, incoming                          longwave radiation, air temperature, sea temperature and                        wind speed and direction.  Analyzing and publishing this                        long-term sensor data will provide the research community                       with a full description of sensor performance for various                       models available for use at sea.  Additionally, IMET system                     software and hardware will be documented for purposes of                        technology transfer to commercial vendors and the research                      community.",
