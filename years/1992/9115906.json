 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of the molecular structures of proteins is increasingly               important as we try to understand their function and to modify that             function by altering their structures through genetic engineering.              One of the important physical tools for studying structure is                   vibrational (i.e., infrared and Raman) spectroscopy, since it is                not limited to the crystalline state (as is x-ray diffraction) or               to the solution state (as is high resolution NMR spectroscopy).                 However, in order to realize its full potential, such spectroscopic             studies must progress beyond the band correlation stage to the use              of the rigorous methods of normal mode analysis, which permit                   detailed predictions to be made of spectral frequencies and                     intensities associated with a given three-dimensional structure.                A strong foundation for such approaches has been laid by refining               an empirical vibrational force field for the polypeptide chain and              applying it to normal mode calculations and the analyses of                     structure in some peptide and polypeptide systems.  Dr. Krimm will              now extend this approach to a number of new systems, involving                  peptide, polypeptide, and disulfide bridge conformations, and use               empirical as well as quantum-mechanical force fields to develop                 molecular mechanics potential functions for accurate spectroscopic              predictions as well as molecular dynamics simulations.",
