 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this  research is to address the issue of fairness               in the context of bargaining.  Over a decade of research by                     experimental economists using sequential-move bargaining games has              documented the observed tendencies toward equal split of the                    available surplus.  This is contrary to the predictions of                      noncooperative equilibrium theory based on self-interested                      bargainers.  Is this due to a preference for fair outcomes, or is               it due to expectations arising in the context of social exchange?               Double blind experiments have already been run where no one,                    including the experimenter, can identify who made what decision.                The project will analyze the effect of this anonymity in a variety              of bargaining games, and explore procedures for assuring that a                 subject has earned the right to an advantageous position in a                   bargaining situation.  These issues are fundamental to                          understanding the nature, circumstances and conditions under which              self-interested outcomes are observed in our society, as well as to             understanding the effect of social context on outcomes, and the                 extent to which they arise because of expectation of reciprocity in             social relationships.  If it is the latter, then fair play is based             on self-interest and may be fragile and dependent upon expectations             of continuing relationships.  This type of research on the effect               of earned rights on behavior toward others is fundamental to                    property rights and contracting in the creation of markets.",
