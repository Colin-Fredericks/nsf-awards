 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal grant is for an ongoing study of correlated lattice                electron systems.  The viewpoint is that of self-consistent-field               approximations and parquet theory.  This allows the generalization              of Hartree-Fock theory to systems having strong correlation and                 large electronic fluctuations.  This provides a semi-analytical                 alternative (and test) for numerical techniques like exact                      diagonalization or simulation.  In addition to development of                   renormalization group techniques for this class of theory, various              issues concerned with superconductivity and charge-density ordering             in strongly correlated materials (such as high-Tc superconductors)              will be studied.                                                                %%%                                                                             The electronic structure of solids determines most, if not all, of              the common properties of materials on which present and future                  technology is based.  However, there are large classes of materials             for which our present understanding is quite limited.  One such                 class is strongly correlated materials (including high-Tc                       superconductors), in which the forces between electrons are very                stong.  This grant funds a project intended to extend to this new               class of materials a group of theoretical techniques which allow                the properties of normal systems to be understood.",
