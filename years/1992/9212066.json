 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the view of                                       genetic algorithms (GAs) in                                                     reinforcement learning problems.  In                                            particular, the research deals with using                                       GAs to specify connectionist or neural                                          network (NN) systems for such                                                   problems.  An analogy between the                                               principle GA-based machine learning                                             paradigm, learning classifier systems                                           (LCSs), and neural learning paradigms                                           suggests the proposed avenue of                                                 research.  Using the analogy, extensive                                         experience with genetics-based machine                                          learning in LCSs can be directly                                                transferred to a larger body of                                                 connectionist learning architectures.                                           The proposal outlines a range of such                                           architectures, and experiments designed                                         to evaluate  performance of these                                               architectures under various                                                     reinforcement learning conditions.  The                                         proposed research differs from typical                                          NN/GA studies, in that most studies                                             consider a population of NNs with a                                             GA applied to tuning connection                                                 weights.  This proposal suggests an                                             LCS-inspired approach, where the GA                                             determines connections within a single                                          NN, by forming new hidden units.  The                                           GA's population-oriented search process                                         is well suited to this task.  The                                               proposed work has two goals:  to refine                                         understanding of evolutionary-                                                  connectionist systems, and to suggest                                           methods for integrating such systems                                            into workable reinforcement learning                                            controllers.",
