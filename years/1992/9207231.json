 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the strongest generalizations in ornithology is that birds               that lay later in the season tend to lay fewer eggs per clutch.                 There is considerable disagreement over the causes of this pattern.             One school maintains that the seasonal decline is a nonadaptive                 consequences of variation in female condition, which has an                     overriding effect both on timing of laying and clutch size.  The                other school sees seasonal clutch size declines as an adaptive                  response to variation in food availability for the laying female                or seasonally declining prospects for rearing offspring.  It is                 proposed to distinguish between these possibilities in three ways.              One experiment will test for the effect of food supply for the                  laying female by decreasing the foraging profitability and the                  condition of the female prior to laying and looking for predicted               shifts in timing of laying and clutch size.  A second experiment                will alter the timing of chick-rearing.  If condition has the                   overwhelming effect on chick-rearing success, then the manipulation             will have no effect on offspring production across groups.  If, on              the other hand, the breeding environment has a predominant effect,              offspring production will vary across groups.  A statistical test               will take data on condition, clutch size, and laying date, and,                 through partial regression analysis, look for a significant effect              of laying date on clutch size once condition is controlled for.                 In all these tests, condition will be measured in terms of fat and              protein stores with the aid of newly developed nondestructive                   techniques.  These results should be of interest not only to                    physiological ecologists interested in the interaction between body             condition and avian histories, but also to population biologists                interested in life history variation.",
