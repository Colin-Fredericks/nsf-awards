 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the mathematical representation of                  arrays of biological neurons that are firing simultaneously with                the goal of inferring their causal connections or influence                     diagram on the basis of firing times.  The methodology of point                 processes of several types will be extended to include full                     likelihood and second-order procedures to extend the results from               social scientists' path analysis and causal modeling.  For small                net works of two or three neurons, partial coherence analysis and               threshold modeling have proved effective; however, for data for a               larger network with eight neurons, nontrivial extensions are                    needed for display and for analysis.                                                 Physiologically, neurons communicate with each other via                   spike trains, emitting pulses that go on to influence other                     neurons; and the neurons are themselves influenced.  The goal of                this research is to infer the connection lines or \"wiring                       diagram\" of a network of neurons by observing their individual                  firing times.",
