 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary purpose of this study is to understand the behavioral               mechanisms involved in the process of hybridization between two                 species of Old World monkeys in the Awash Hybrid Zone (AHZ) in                  Ethiopia.                                                                                                                                                       While anubis and hamadryas baboons generally live in different                  habitats, their ranges overlap in Ethiopia and, despite marked                  differences in morphology and social organization, they                         hybridize.  Although earlier studies suggested the zone was                     narrow and stable, it now appears to be expanding, and previously               \"pure\" anubis groups contain a significant number of hybrid                     individuals.  While there have been studies of the role of male                 actions in determining events contributing to hybridization,                    there have been none relating to female behaviors.                                                                                                              In the AHZ males of varying phenotypes coexist within the same                  social group and their contrasting morphologies and mating                      strategies make this location the ideal testing ground for                      exploring the existence and the basis of female partner                         preference.  Female behaviors such as presenting frequency,                     grooming and proximity maintenance will be recorded using focal                 animal sampling.  Behaviors of other group members and broad                    ecological parameters will be recorded to assess the context in                 which activities occur.",
