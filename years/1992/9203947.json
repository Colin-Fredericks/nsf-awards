This program builds on the techniques and results of                 the 1989 AIDA (Arecibo Initiative in Dynamics of the Atmosphere)                campaign and will utilize the radar and optical facilities of                   Arecibo Observatory as well as sodium and iron lidars from Penn                 State and/or the University of Illinois.  Of particular interest                are the apparently linked dynamical and chemical processes                      leading to the formation of ion, neutral sodium, and neutral iron               layers in the 80-110 km height range.  Additional interest                      centers on the origin of the 6-hour tide, the relationship of                   this tide with sporadic intermediate ionization layers, on the                  occasional unexplained occurrence of ion layers as low as 82 km                 altitude, and on convective processes as observed in the sodium                 layer.  This research program will culminate in the proposed 1994               AIDA-LAMS (LAyers and MicroStructure) campaign which will utilize               several radars and lidars as well as other instruments to                       investigate these and other phenomena.  Several graduate and                    undergraduate students will be part of this research effort which               also involves research residencies at the Observatory.",
