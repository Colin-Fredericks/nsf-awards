 "awd_abstract_narration": "The late Middle and early Upper Ordovician carbonate and                   siliciclastic rocks of the Trenton Group in the northern                        Appalachian foreland basin enclose a large number of altered                    volcanic ash beds (K-bentonites) deposited from Plinian eruptions               on an off-shore volcanic arc.  These strata also form part of the               standard reference section of the North American Ordovician time                scale as well as the reference standard for the conodont and                    graptolite biozonations commonly used for temporal correlation in               this interval.  The goal of the research is to employ geochemical               fingerprinting of unaltered phenocrysts within the K-bentonites                 together with new and detailed studies of the ranges of graptolite              and conodont species to integrate these separate stratigraphies                 into a unified chronostratigraphic network.                                          We propose to accomplish this by 1) establishing precise ties              between the graptolite zones and the North Atlantic and                         midcontinent conodont zones based on detailed collecting of range               data from numerous measured sections that each span the facies                  transition from Trenton Group carbonates into the Utica Shale and               2) establishing precise ties between the laterally equivalent                   siliciclastic and carbonate facies based on the identification of               synchronous time planes through geochemical fingerprinting of the               K-bentonites.  The techniques to be employed for K-bentonite                    correlation include analysis of 1) major and trace element                      composition of melt inclusions within quartz phenocrysts.                       Additionally, we propose to use high precision U-Pb zircon                      geochronometry to calibrate our chronostratigraphy.                                  The resulting chronostratigraphy will provide a temporal                   framework, calibrated in years, that will provide a direct test of              the accuracy of the existing graptolite and conodont                            biostratigraphies as well as sequence stratigraphic and                         coenocorrelation studies of these rocks.  This chronostratigraphy               will constitute the temporal framework necessary for studies of the             rate of evolution among graptolites and other organisms that occur              in the studied sections.  Simultaneously, the K-bentonite                       geochemical and geochronological data will provide unique insights              about the tectonic provenance of these altered volcanic ash beds                and the nature and duration of Taconic orogenic events.",
