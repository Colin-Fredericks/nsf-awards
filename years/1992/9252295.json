 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will assist in the development of an aquatic                       ecology center at Arkansas Tech University that is designed to                  demonstrate ecological principles and promote interdisciplinary                 research by undergraduate students.  The center is well                         equipped for sampling living organisms, but these biotic                        communities can be greatly influenced by transient abiotic                      factors that vary regularly (e.g., daily or seasonally) or are                  unpredictable (e.g., occur during storm events or accidental                    pollutant discharge).   Equipping the aquatic ecology center                    with two sequential water samplers; two meters for continuous                   chemical records; two water level recorders; and accessories to                 electronically transfer data will permit students to                            investigate both short-term and long-term environmental                         changes.  Multiple meter sets will allow hypothesis testing                     among stream sites and among lake depths.  This center will                     provide invaluable experience to upper division undergraduates                  in several science majors regardless of whether they enter                      their careers directly or pursue graduate degrees.  The                         equipment will also be of use in a summer conservation course                   for high school science teachers, and in the Gifted and                         Talented program for outstanding high school students.",
