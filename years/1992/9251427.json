This project                   facilitates the study of human factors in a state-of-the-art                    laboratory.  Students are able to investigate how to design                     jobs and workplaces to fit human capabilities.  The new                         equipment includes a computerized metabolic measurement system                  for determining the physiological costs of physical work, a                     vision tester for measurement of visual performance, a leg and                  arm ergometer for simulating work performed by legs and arms,                   and a computerized digital goniometer to measure joint angles                   and range of motion.  Laboratory experiments are conducted by                   the students as part of their course-work and through                           independent studies and projects.",
