 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                  of Professor Greg A. Slough at the College of Wooster.  The                     hydrosilylation of ketones with a co-catalytic mixture of                       Wilkinson's catalyst and galvinoxyl radical will be                             investigated.  Mechanistic studies will attempt to provide                      evidence for a ketyl radical intermediate.  A series of                         4-substituted phenyl cyclopropyl ketones and 5-hexenones will                   be investigated.  The use of a chiral Wilkinson's catalyst to                   explore the effect of galvinoxyl on chiral induction and the                    effect of the chiral ligand on the reaction will also be                        examined.  The scope of the reaction will be determined with a                  series of \"5-hexenones\" which ultimately produce cyclized                       products.                                                                       %%%                                                                             The ability of specifically designed materials to speed up                      organic transformations (catalysis) will be studied.  The                       intimate details of how a metal containing compound can                         catalyze the delivery of a hydrogen to an organic molecule will                 be explored.  The ability of this system to specifically                        produce only one of the two possible products which are mirror                  images of each other will also be investigated.  The results                    obtained from this study will provide information which can be                  used to improve the ability to construct important molecules.",
