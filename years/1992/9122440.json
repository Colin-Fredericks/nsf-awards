 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is common knowledge that American presidents rely on private                 pollsters to provide them with a sense of contemporary public                   opinion.  The relationship between presidents and their pollsters               is routinely discussed in the mass media, and presidents openly                 refer to their public opinion surveys.  This close and open                     relationship between the White House and pollsters, however, is                 quite recent.  It began in earnest during the administration of                 John F. Kennedy.                                                                                                                                                This research investigation addresses the question:  what                       difference do White House polls make in presidents' policy                      positions.  In short, do polling results affect the decisions of                presidents?  Specifically, the researchers investigate the                      relationship between the policy positions of American presidents                and the public opinion surveys that they assembled.  The opinion                surveys are located in presidential archives and will, for the                  first time, be systematically collected.  Because scholars have                 previously relied on published polls, the surveys in presidential               archives offer new and better data for examining the president's                relationship with the mass public.                                                                                                                              The analysis focuses on two presidents; John F. Kennedy and Lyndon              B. Johnson.  In addition to collecting the survey data, the                     researchers will examine evidence concerning other possible                     invluences on presidential decision making, such as partisan                    divisions in Congress and economic conditions.  The objective is                to evaluate the significance of presidents'polling results relative             to the influence of other political and institutional variables.",
