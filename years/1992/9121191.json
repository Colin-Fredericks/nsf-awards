 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two year project allows a multi-disciplinary team of authors               to prepare a text book of case studies illustrating ethical issues              involved in human use of animals.  The cases will focus                         particularly on the use of animals in scientific experiments, but               will also include their use in numerous other settings.  Cases will             involve major historical events of the last decade, and others that             are composites of important social issues.  Authors include a                   physiologist, a philosopher, a lawyer and a veterinarian, to                    provide a range of expertise and viewpoints.  Consultants will                  review the manuscripts, to provide oversight and further views.                 Major scholarly publishing houses will be solicited for interest in             publication, and wide distribution of the book is anticipated.  The             cases are intended to serve a broad range of educational purposes.              Target readership covers scientists, students, teachers and the                 public.  Each have interest and need to understand the value                    judgments and conflicts surrounding human and animal interaction.               In particular, scientists whose careers involve animal                          experimentation usually receive no instruction about the ethical                dimensions of their work.  But, in order to train teachers to                   introduce this material into their courses, they need texts.                    Currently there are few suitable sources.  This project represents              a fresh approach that has been used successfully in other fields of             ethics.",
