 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will establish a new, non-equilibrium process for the                        preparation of quantum dots of arbitrary composition in a variety               of hosts.  This process features a versatile laser ablation                     supersonic expansion source for the synthesis of size-selected                  semiconductor quantum dots.  Gas phase processing of the dots is                extended with a molecule-particle CVD (MPCVD) technique which                   yields a dot/host composite which consists of semiconductor quantum             dots grown epitaxially within a crystalline semiconductor host.                 These new materials systems are expected to yield new insights into             the interfacial, morphological, and phase stability of small                    systems and to provide a high-performance materials platform for                integrated photonic device structures.  The goals of the research               program are: 1) to provide a materials design knowledge base; 2) to             discover new optical phenomena which evolve from the interacting                fields within nanocomposite materials and to develop materials                  characterization methods for photonic materials; 3) to understand               and demonstrate the fundamental limits in monodispersity of                     heterogeneous systems and in the stability of materials under                   intense photon fields; and 4) to lay the ground work for the design             and fabrication of thin film optical components by employing                    varying dot and host compositions, sizes, and dot densities.                    %%%                                                                             A new approach for the synthesis and processing of novel quantum                dot thin film materials for nonlinear optical applications is being             explored in this research program.  The approach exploits a series              of new gas-phase processing techniques to produce an array of                   materials consistingg of semiconductor clusters of nonlinear                    optical materials of the elemental systems, Ge and Si, in epitaxial             environments of Si, GaAs, and ZnSe.  These dots, ranging in sizes               from the very small (~100 atoms) to the very large (~10,000 atoms)              systems, are expected to provide greatly enhanced nonlinear optical             properties over those of bulk semiconductors through quantum                    confinement effects.  The resulting crystalline materials differ                markedly from any quantum dot materials produced to date by using               a confining matrix as a means not only to isolate the clusters from             each other, but also to fully define and satisfy critical surface               properties of the confined cluster.   These materials represent a               significant potential for future nonlinear optical devices for                  advanced applications in  computing, information processing, and                communications.",
