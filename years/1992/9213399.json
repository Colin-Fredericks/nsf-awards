This research will focus on the synthesis of                        organic-inorganic designer solids, specifically thin films                      fabricated in a layer-by-layer fashion with two-dimensional                     periodicity parallel to the surface and total control of the                    composition in the  perpendicular direction. The parallel                       sheets will be hexagonal lattices formed by polymerization of                   organometallic sandwich complexes, while the vertical pillars                   will be carborane-based rods containing a central dipolar                       chromophore parallel to the hexagonal sheets and capable of                     rotating about the pillar axis in the presence of an external                   electric field. The length of the rigid carborane rods will be                  varied to provide variable spacing between the parallel sheets                  and a novel interfacial technique will be used to build up the                  thickness of the thin films.                                                    %%%                                                                             The synthetic methodolgy developed by this research will                        provide the basis for designing layered films with broad                        potential across several materials application areas.                           Electronic and photonic materials, for example, wave guides,                    are envisioned.",
