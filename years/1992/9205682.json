 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on mathematical problems of complex                analysis and geometry.  Specifically, work will be done on                      questions in complex manifold theory and Kahler geometry.                       Several major areas are mapped out in the proposal, including                   that of superrigidity of compact quotients of irreducible                       Riemannian symmetric manifolds.  By this one understands                        manifolds with the property that any smooth transformation to a                 nonpositively curved manifold must be homotopic to an isometry.                 The goal of this work is to prove superrigidity of quotients of                 symmetric manifolds other than balls.  Another direction will                   involve the global nondeformability of compact Hermitian                        symmetric manifolds.  This work will build on a recent proof of                 the nondeformability of complex projective space using a                        technique which counts the number of zeros of holomorphic vector                fields.  Additionally, work will be done on the Hartshorne                      conjecture concerning the nonempty intersection of two complex                  submanifolds with positive normal bundle in a projective                        algebraic manifold.  Current research suggests such intersections               must always be nonempty if the sum of their dimensions is at                    least the dimension of the ambient manifold.  At least three                    different approaches are planned.",
