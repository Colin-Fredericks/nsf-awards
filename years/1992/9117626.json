STORMFEST's primary             scientific goals are first, to field-test new mesoscale observing               and forecasting systems in preparation for later major field                    experiments of the U.S. Weather Research Program; and second, to                study the mesoscale structures of winter frontal and precipitation              synoptic scale flow in which they are embedded.  His objective is               to quantitatively describe the structure of the Planetary Boundary              Layer (PBL) in a 50-km square nested within the larger scale                    experimental array.  The data will provide estimates of fluxes and              profiles over the diurnal cycle, in a variety of meteorological                 situations, with varying cloud cover.  The database can later be                used by other investigators in conjunction with other experimental              (numerical large-eddy simulation) data to comparatively evaluate                the various PBL parameterizations currently in use in GCM and                   climate models, and, it is hoped, lead to improved versions of                  these.",
