 "awd_abstract_narration": "The urease isozymes of soybean are relatively well-characterized                genetically, biochemically and at the molecular level.  From                    previous work, several promising areas for advancing our                        understanding of plant biology have emerged, and they have lead to              three hypotheses which form the bases of our reserch plan.                      Accessory genes Eu2 and Eu3, which are necessary for the maturation             of the soybean urease apoenzymes, and involved in plant (and                    commensal bacterial) nickel metabolism.  We aim to clone these                  genes and to characterize their products with a goal of                         understanding metal utilization in plants and an aspect of plant-               microbe interaction.  The central physiological role of urease in               plants is in the mobilization and turnover of stored protein                    reserves which occurs during seed germination.  We will test                    germination signals on urease expression and will thus also address             the paradox of the tissue-ubiquitous distribution of urease and its             apparent non-essentiality.  The seed urease-null mutation, eu1-sun,             is caused by a movable genetic element in soybean.  While genetic               data suggest that this is so wel will work at the molecular level               to confirm this hypothesis.  Goals are two-fold; to elucidate the               molecular basis of the mutation, and to isolate a mobile DNA                    element for soybean.",
