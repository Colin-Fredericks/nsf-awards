 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CONCERT Network (COmmunications for North Carolina Education,               Research, and Technology) is a mid-level network that serves the                State of North Carolina.  CONCERT is connected directly to the                  NSFNET Backbone Network.  It is the intention of CONCERT to offer               NSFNET connections to all higher education institutions in North                Carolina.                                                                                                                                                       This proposal requests support to establish nine new connections                for: Campbell University, Catawba College, Chowan College, Elon                 College, Lees-McRae College, Meredith College, Mount Olive                      College, Queens College, and Shaw University.                                                                                                                   A primary goal of CONCERT is to facilitate collaborative projects               and sharing of resources between instutuion, including those                    outside the state.  CONCERT will provide operations management                  and information services as well as provide appropriate dedicated               connections to the nine institutions.                                                                                                                           The universities need greater functionality and network speed to                be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                      transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail               system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.               This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore                    innovative educational resources.***//",
