 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research in active vision has show that creating a visual                system for a robot interacting with an unstructured, dynamic                    world differs vastly from interpreting a static image.  On one                  hand, the constraints of real-time performance force                            optimizations such as a focus of attention and spatially variant                sensing.  On the other hand, the availability of a large number                 of views, whose acquisition is controlled by the robot, has                     proven to simplify problems enormously.  In addition, the                       processing necessary to permit intelligent behavior has been                    found to be easier to achieve than the difficult goal of                        reconstruction and full interpretation of a science form a single               image.  This research explores two open problems suggested by                   ongoing research in active vision.  One problem is the study the                control of a spatially variant (foveal) sensor using the low-                   resolution formation available in the periphery.  In particular,                this research will examine the use of color information, which                  has been shown to be well preserved under low resolution.  The                  other problem is the integration of set of visual modules, each                 capable of sustaining a particular task, with a suitable robot                  architecture sos that the resulting system is capable of timely,                flexible interaction with a dynamic world. //",
