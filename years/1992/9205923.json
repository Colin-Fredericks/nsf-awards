 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports living expenses for four                    Indian scientists and graduate students to participate in a                     multi-institution experiment at Fermi Laboratory.   The                         experiment E706 is designed to study interactions of protons,                   pions and kaons in a variety of targets, triggering on high                     transverse momentum (>5 GeV/C) electromagnetic showers.  It is a                second generation fixed target experiment using high energy beams               (800 GeV protons from Fermilab Tevatron) and with a wide                        acceptance spectrometer, it is intended to reach approximately 10               GeV/C.  A goal of the experiment is to obtain information on                    quark and gluon interactions in collisions of positive pions,                   negative pions and protons with nucleons.  The Indian scientists                participation includes building detectors, data acquisition and                 data analysis.                                                                                                                                                  Scope:  This is a renewal of work currently under the leadership                of Dr. Peoples at Fermilab, Dr. Paul Slattery of the University                 of Rochester, and of Dr. R. Shivpuri of the University of Delhi.                The collaboration is considered quite successful, and a number of               joint publications have resulted.  The project fits the U.S.-                   India Cooperative Science Program objectives.",
