 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops an instrumentation laboratory for                         machinery diagnostics and condition monitoring to meet the need                 for imparting hands-on, technical skills related to the dynamic                 characterization, detection and prediction of incipient                         failures of machine components.  Diagnostics concepts such as                   resonant and off-resonant response, Fourier spectrum, transfer                  function, coherence and cascading of vibration signals are                      demonstrated, as well as introduction to the selection of                       transducers and their computer interface for rapid data                         acquisition and analysis.  Instrumentation applications for                     machine diagnostics is central to this project.  The laboratory                 enables cohesive and effective instruction of basic vibration                   principles and their application for machine diagnosis, to the                  four year upper level undergraduate engineering technology                      students of Texas A&M University.  The laboratory is used in                    three interrelated courses, namely Applied Vibrations,                          Instrumentation, and Electro-Mechanical Systems.  Nearly 150                    students annually from the mechanical, manufacturing and                        electronics engineering technology specialties will benefit.",
