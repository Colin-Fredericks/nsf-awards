 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is aimed at obtaining a unified treatment of                       turbulent mixing and of turbulent transfer to a wall of                         molecular species, and of spherical particles.  Theory in this                  area has not advanced significantly over the past forty years.                  However, the recent availability of direct numerical                            simulations opens the possibility of making considerable                        progress.  A main objective of this proposal is to exploit                      this opportunity.                                                                                                                                               Results on the simultaneous three-dimensional time-dependent                    velocity and temperature fields will be obtained for a wide                     range of Prandtl numbers for turbulent flow in a channel and                    for turbulent Couette flow.  Present theories will be                           evaluated.  However, special emphasis will be placed on the                     relation of the structure of the temperature field to the                       structure of the velocity field and on how turbulent transport                  is modified by molecular transport.  Lagrangian methods will                    be explored as a means to obtained better physical                              understanding.  The temperature field is viewed as resulting                    from a distribution of wall sources.  The exploitation of this                  approach has been opened up because of the possibility of                       studying, on the computer, the behavior of wall sources.  The                   transport of spherical particles differs from transport of                      molecular species because of extraneous contributions to                        transport by gravity, turbophoresis and lift.  These effects                    will be studied both in computer and in laboratory                              experiments.  Particular attention will be given to obtaining                   much needed information about inertial free flight to the                       wall.  We will also continue recent work in which we exploit                    Lagrangian methods to analyze sediment transport.",
