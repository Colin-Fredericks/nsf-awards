 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the present work is to develop a fundamental                   knowledge base for microscale dropwise melt deposition, and to                  explore possible applications and equipment design for those                    applications.  A variety of modes of controlled microdrop                       deposition will be investigated, followed by detailed                           quantitative studies aimed at identifying the controlling                       thermo-physical processes and the parameters that determine                     satisfactory deposition in each mode.  These studies will be                    made using microdrops of  various waxes in a test system which                  is capable of generating very reproducible droplets at various                  melt temperatures and droplet deposition speeds over a broad                    range of deposition frequencies.  Although these                                investigations use waxes, one of the main objectives of the                     program will be to develop scaling laws for the various                         deposition modes, and possibly also some useful analytical                      models based on simplified models of the thermo-physical                        solidification processes that are involved.  This will lead to                  an understanding of how the data for wax extrapolates to other                  melt materials.  Some tests will also be made with low melting                  point metals like tin as a check on the proposed scaling laws                   derived from analysis and data on waves.                                                                                                                        The buildup of materials or physical objects by controlled                      deposition of melt microdrops has potential applications in                     rapid prototyping, 3D copying, direct fabrication of small                      structures including electronics packaging and materials                        processing.",
