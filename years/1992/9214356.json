 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two modern X-ray diffraction units will replace the present                     obsolete (40 years old) X-ray diffractometers in the                            Materials Science and Engineering Department at Stevens                         Institute of Technology.  These diffractometers will be                         housed in the newly renovated Stevens Materials                                 Characterization Facility, along with state-of-the-art                          field emission TEMs and SEMs, and made available to the New                     Jersey Technological Community.  One of the diffractometers                     will be a limited resolution unit with automatic sample                         exchange that will be used for undergraduate instruction in                     Steven's computer-oriented courses and for graduate student                     training.  The second diffractometer will have a grazing                        angle thin film attachment for crystallographic texture and                     stress analysis of thin film materials and will be                              dedicated for research on the crystallization of thin film,                     electrochemically deposited coatings, tribochemical                             reactions in ceramics, and the chemical vapor deposition of                     ceramic coatings and superconducting materials.  The                            availablity of the new X-ray diffraction equipment will                         improve data acquisition and enable improved quantitative                       analysis.  Finally, the proposed new equipment will have                        the most modern safety equipment, thereby insuring the                          safety of students using the Material Characterization                          equipment.",
