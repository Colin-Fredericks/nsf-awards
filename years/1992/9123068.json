 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the intensity with which the aurora has been studied at               radio wavelengths, there remains a gap in the ground measurements               between a few hundred kiloHertz, the upper range of VLF                         experiments, and a few tens of megaHertz, at which riometers                    operate.  A number of ground observations indicate that emissions               are generated by the aurora in this frequency range, but the                    observations are spotty, and the nature and even the existence of               these emissions remains uncertain.  There is some theoretical work              justifying the investigation of auroral emissions using ground-                 based instrumentation, but more systematic observations are needed              to lay the groundwork for further theoretical progress.  Under a                previous NSF grant, a PC-based instrument for monitoring 0.1-5 MHz              radio waves from remote sites has been developed and operated for               one Winter, a preliminary analysis of the data has been done, and               publications on this related subjects have been prepared or                     published.  In the next year, we propose to continue collecting                 radio data from Alaska with an improved version of the instrument.              We further propose three specific plans for completing the analysis             of last year's data and the data from the upcoming year.  The goals             of the further year of study are:  1) to provide a solid start                  towards clearing up the uncertainty regarding the existence of                  and/or natures of LF/MF/HF emissions observable on the ground from              aurorae; 2) to determine whether the method of using PC-based radio             receivers in the Northern Hemisphere shows promise for longer-term              observations of auroral emissions in the frequency range; and 3) to             complete several specific data analysis goals which are achievable              with data collected last year, and which will be enhanced by a                  further year of data.",
