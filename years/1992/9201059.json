 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSFNET, a nationwide computer network sponsored by the                 National Science Foundation for use by the academic research and                education community, has used the Defense Data Network (DDN)                    system for assigning and registering electronic addresses for                   authorized host computers.  These unique addresses were assigned                by SRI International, Inc. as part of long term contract that DCA               had with SRI and through an Interagency Agreement the Defense                   Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA) had with NSF.                               The National Science Foundation's mounting responsibility to               provide the communications infrastructure, including information                services for the scientific community and for the pending High                  Performance Computing and Communications initiative (HPCC), has                 made it necessary for NSF to assume responsibilty for provision                 of its own registration services for the user community.                             As a result of a recompetition for services, GSI has                       replaced SRI as the contractor to DCA for provision of                          registration services and network and host machine address                      assignment.  Accordingly, the DCA agrees to provide address                     registration services for the NSF community of users on an                      interim basis while the NSF implements its own soliciation for                  long term registration and information services.  This will                     insure continuity of this critical operation for the entire                     Internet community.",
