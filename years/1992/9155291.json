 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Exploratorium requests support for four nationally                          recognized installation artists to develop scientifically                       relevant, interactive exhibits that will model the movements of                 waves, clouds, and flowing water and their interplay on and with                the Earth's surface.  By manipulating or enhancing the behavior                 of these simulated elemental forces, changing their scale or the                perspective from which they are observed, or slowing down or                    speeding up their natural processes, the artists can bring out                  characteristics not easily observed, normally.  Cross-                          referenced to other Exploratorium exhibits, these pieces will                   form the center of a subset of exhibits on the physics of fluid                 motion and the interaction of elemental forces.  They will serve                as a starting point for exploring the physical conditions that                  can cause and support the natural phenomena modeled by the                      artists.                                                                                                                                                        We will develop two different kinds of dissemination materials:                 1) A publication for museum professionals, addressing the use of                art in presenting science to the public.  2) Printed guides                     which will designate environmentally relevant exhibits at the                   Exploratorium dealing with aspects fluid movements in nature.                   These new \"Pathways\" will be intended for children and will be                  made available to students coming on Field Trips and the general                public.  They will be produced in coordination with two other                   Pathways on Energy and distributed in packets entitled \"Energy                  and the Environment.\"",
