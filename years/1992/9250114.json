 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pattern formation phenomena occur universally in nature.                  The proposed work focuses on one dimensional pattern formation                  which occurs in wetting, with the objective of understanding the                spreading of a fluid meniscus coated by a surfactant monolayer.                 Wetting dynamics are to be studied by microscopic imaging of a                  vertical meniscus to view the motion of the three phase contact                 line as it moves in response to an applied thermal gradient.                    Quantitative analysis of patterns forming in the spreading front of             the pure fluid and in the monolayer is used to elucidate the                    mechanisms underlying the instabilities in the wetting process                  causing the pattern growth.                                                           The work proposed on the spreading of a fluid                             contaminated by a surfactant is relevant to technologies such as                oil recovery, chemical spraying, and coating processes.  In                     addition to contributing to the understanding of a complex wetting              problem, this work may further the understanding of the deposition              of an organic layer on an inorganic substrate, as is done in the                Langmuir-Blodgett process.                                                            This project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                   opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:  the               development and teaching of a new course in the Princeton                       Materials Institute; initiating a program to introduce lower level              undergraduates to scientific and/or engineering research as a                   career option; and a seminar series on organic materials which                  includes several women speakers.",
