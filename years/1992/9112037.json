 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many factors are known to influence the abundance and                    diversity of insects that feed on plants.  These include host                   plant characteristics such as nutrition and secondary compounds,                attack by predators/parasites, and abiotic factors such as                      temperature and humidity.  Microorganisms such as bacteria,                     viruses, and fungi commonly associated with plants can also                     influence where insects settle and how well they fare.  One                     class of microorganisms, endophytic fungi, live benignly within                 leaf tissues but appear to protect plants from insect attack by                 producing deterrent toxins.  This idea has not been broadly                     tested however, particularly in plants other than grasses.                             Toward this end, the role of endophytic fungus                           (Chaetophoma quercifolia and several other species) in                          colonization, dispersal, and survival of a leafmining insect                    (Cameraria sp. nov.) and the southwestern tent caterpillar                      (Malacosoma incurvum) on Emory oak (Quercus emoryi) will be                     studied.  The following are to be investigated: 1) how the                      distribution of fungi, insects, and plant characteristics are                   related, 2) seasonal and yearly variation in the diversity and                  abundance of fungi, 3) if endophytic fungi affect survival and                  growth of leafminers and other oak-feeding insects.  This work                  will serve to address fundamental ecological questions, as well                 as increase our knowledge and understanding of microorganisms as                potential biological control agents.",
