 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international transfer of capital for investment purposes has               had a profound effect in determining the direction and profile of               world economic development and political change.  Historically,                 critics on the left have equated the export of capital with                     financial imperialism, while in recent years critics on the right               have accused the American government of selling the nation's                    birthright to the Japanese.  It is also the case that in the last               century the rapid development of Australia, Canada, and the                     United States were at least partially underwritten by massive                   capital transfers from Britain, and in this century the                         reemergence of Germany and Japan from the devastation of the                    Second World War can be attributed in some important measure to                 capital transfers from the U.S.  There is little doubt that the                 existing global distribution of economic activity has been                      affected by almost two centuries of international capital                       transfers.  Yet, despite those two hundred years of history and                 rhetoric, very little is actually known about the exact                         relationship among international capital transfers, the transfer                of institutional technology, and the diffusion of economic                      growth.  The purpose of this project is to develop a basis for                  analyzing these relationships.  This is important because it will               give us a better understanding of the role of foreign and                       domestic capital markets in promoting economic growth and                       development.                                                                                                                                                    Specifically, the research will focus on the role of British                    international capital flows in the late nineteenth and early                    twentieth centuries in promoting development in Australia,                      Canada, the United States, and Argentina.  The study will be                    concerned with the mechanisms of international capital transfers,               the diffusion of financial institutional forms from Britain to                  the other four countries, and adaptations of these institutional                forms to local conditions and requirements.  Finally, it will                   analyze the distribution of British capital among sectors and                   organizational forms, and it will attempt to assess the impact of               British capital on local development.",
