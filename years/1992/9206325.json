 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction of myosin (thick filaments) and actin (thin                     filaments) which results in muscle contraction is regulated by                  reversible binding of calcium ions to intracellular, regulatory                 proteins.  Depending on the source of the muscle, the calcium-                  binding protein may be a subunit of myosin, troponin (associated                with actin), or both acting in concert.  The long term objective of             the research is to elucidate the basic molecular mechanisms of the              troponin-linked and myosin-linked calcium regulation in muscle.  We             will investigate the way in which calcium influences the                        interactions of the muscle regulatory proteins.  The calcium-                   binding subunits, troponin C and myosin light chains, are                       homologous proteins.  Our results will identify similarities and                differences in the structures and interactions of these proteins                which are indicative of fundamental common mechanisms as well as                key specific differences which have led to functional                           specialization in the two regulatory systems.  Our experimental                 approach is based on the use of intermolecular chemical                         crosslinking of the regulatory proteins.  Mass spectrometry and                 protein chemistry techniques will be used to identify crosslinked               amino acid residues in each protein.  Site-directed mutagenesis                 will be used to be used to increase the range of possibilities for              crosslinking and to further characterize the details of the                     interaction sites.                                                              %%%                                                                             Muscle contraction is regulated by reversible binding of calcium                ions to intracellular, regulatory proteins.
