The strength of the                   meetings lies in the broad international participation of                       statisticians, biologists, and mathematicians interested in                     quantitative and statistical aspects of biology, genetics,                      envirnomental science, and other fields.  Topics to be discussed                on statistical areas directly related to these issues include                   survival analysis, epidemiology, genetics, molecular biology,                   environmental pollution monitoring, modeling metabolism and                     pharmacokinetics;  all of which have direct bearing on solutions                to the major concerns of today including AIDS, cancer and heart                 diseases, plant science epidemiology and agriculture.  In                       addition, discussions on fundamental statistical issues of                      repeated measures, structural inference, image processing and                   causal inference all have direct application to current health                  related and agricultural sciences.  It is anticipated that the                  Conference, which is the major international meeting of                         biostatisticians and biometricians throughout the world will be                 attended by 500 or more scientists from the international                       community.                                                                           This award will  partially support the travel of                           approximately 16 scientists from the United States to attend the                16th International Biometric Conference, which is to be held 7-11               December, 1992 in Hamilton, New Zealand.
