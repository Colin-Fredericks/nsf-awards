The project will study the relation of social                    structure to craft organization in two pottery cooperatives in                  the Ivory Coast.  Using a combination of ethnographic methods                   including participant observation and structured life-history                   interviews, the student will examine the relationships among                    economic and social factors such as inheritance and labor                       processes as well as the tradeoffs between subsistence and cash                 activities.                                                                                                                                                     This research is important because cooperatives, especially craft               cooperatives, have long been promoted as a means of African                     development and have been a highly visible failure.  This careful               case study will reveal the reasons for differential success and                 failure and will serve as a resource for planners and scholars                  studying the role of craft production in development.",
