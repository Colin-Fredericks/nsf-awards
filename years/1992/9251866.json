 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of the transition from a quarter to a semester calendar                 system the Physics Department has designed and is implementing                  a new course in experimental physics for incoming students who                  are seriously interested in physics.  The purpose of the course                 is to excite students about experimental science and help them                  develop an understanding of how experiments are designed,                       assembled and carried out.  The course may attract and retain                   more physics majors.  The experiments are based on a relatively                 limited number of topics which can be investigated                              experimentally with a minimum of theoretical background.                        Initial experiments include:  1) the geometrical optics of a                    telescope; 2) construction and properties of vacuum systems; 3)                 thermal cooling in a vacuum; and 4) production of thin metallic                 films and measurement of their electrical resistivity.  As the                  course develops new experiments will be added including simple                  analogue and digital electronics and the use of analogue and                    digital methods to measure the output of an electrical sensor.                  Wherever possible special emphasis is being placed on how                       computers can be used to take, analyze and simulate data.  The                  laboratories are open ended with emphasis on the acquisition of                 experimental skills and knowledge.",
