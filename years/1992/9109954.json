The                            major goals of this work are to: a) Develop a layout                            and design program which includes relevant optical                              and electrical properties of free space optical                                 interconnects.  b) Combine the alignment                                        properties of lithographically formed binary optical                            elements with the high spatial frequency recording                              capability and single exposure formation properties                             of volume gratings.  c) Evaluate methods to reduce                              misalignment effects of free space beams                                        propagating between boards, and establish a                                     minimal set of substrate-mode holographic                                       interconnects for distributing signals in the plane of                          the board.  d) Develop and evaluate alignment and                               packaging techniques for stacked optical systems                                with electronic processor elements.  e) Use the                                 interconnect design model to build a board level                                interconnect system which transfers data in parallel                            between three boards.  The interconnect locations                               on boards will be optimized to reduce latency                                   effects.",
