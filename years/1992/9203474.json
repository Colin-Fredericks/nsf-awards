 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the analysis and interpretation of a large-              airgun OBS seismic refraction data set collected in the Gulf of                 Guinea, offshore West Africa.  This data set is a subset of a                   larger one collected by French scientists in 1990.  This part of                the African margin is known as the Ivory Coast-Ghana Margin, and is             an example of a passive margin formed through transform rifting.                The crustal structures developed during transform rifting are                   relatively poorly understood. Seismic refraction data offer one of              the best means of determining crustal thicknesses and structures                resulting from this process.  Information derived from the seismic              refraction data analysis will also be used as part of a site survey             for upcoming ODP activities in the area.                                        %%%                                                                             When continents rift apart, they may do so through divergent (major             direction of motion perpendicular to continent-continent boundary               line) or transform (major direction of motion parallel to                       continent-continent boundary line) processes.   The latter process              has not been studied in as much detail as the former, and is                    relatively poorly understood.  The rifting record is contained in               now-buried and submerged structures within passive margins, or                  trailing edges of continents.  These structures can perhaps be best             determined through deep seismic sounding techniques.                                                                                                            Within the area offshore West Africa known as the Ivory Coast-Ghana             Margin, lie submerged features that record the transform rifting                that occurred between West Africa and Brazil in the Cretaceous.                 Ocean Bottom Seismometer seismic refraction data collected in 1990              will be analyzed and interpreted, resulting in a picture of                     subsurface structures in this region.  In addition to answering                 fundamental questions concerning the nature of structures contained             within transform passive margins, the seismic data will be used as              background information for upcoming Ocean Drilling Project                      activities in the area.",
