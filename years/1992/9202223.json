 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this work is to establish and ambitious                analytical and experimental program to understand and then to                   predict the failure mechanics and mechanisms of curved layered                  composites. Analytical studies will be directed towards (a)                     determining analytical elasticity solutions for the stress                      response of uncracked curved composites under general loadings,                 (b) predicting initial failure modes (interface of matrix                       cracking), failure locations based on proper failure criteria                   under specific critical loads, (c) determining stress                           singularities of curved interface crack between dissimilar                      cylindrically orthotopic or anisotropic media and of matrix                     cracking impinging on the curved interface. Finite element                      studies will then emphasize on (a) developing singular finite                   elements to investigate the stress fields near the crack tip                    corresponding to each failure mode for test specimens of                        practical dimensions. The element formulation will incorporate                  proper singular terms obtained from analytical study, (b)                       investigating the essential features of failure process in curved               composites with emphasis on the role of shell curvature, (c)                    determining the mixed-mode fracture parameters K1, K11, and K111                in terms of various geometry parameters and loading conditions,                 (b) predicting fracture models and stable, unstable crack growth                or crack arrest. Experimental data will be also used to develop                 and validate failure criteria as part of the proposed work. The                 analytical predictions, finite element results and experimental                 data will be collated and critically compared to provide a full                 understanding of both the failure behavior of curved composites                 and the predictive capability of various models.*** //",
