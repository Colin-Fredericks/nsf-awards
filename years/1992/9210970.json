 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important problem with the hot isostatic pressing (HIP)                 process is the occurrence of shape distortion, which greatly limits             the potential of HIP as a net or near net shape processing                      technology.  The basic objective of the research is to explore the              use of feedback control principles for reducing the unpredictable               shape distortion due to model inaccuracy and process disturbance.               The feedback compensation is achieved by adjusting the HIP                      temperature and pressure in real time based on the densification                information provided by the in-situ eddy current sensors.  Due to               the multi-input multi-output, nonlinear and uncertain nature of the             HIP process dynamics, a modified version of the model predictive                control method will be used to design the computer control system.              A state estimator will be constructed to estimate the densification             status from the impedance values provided by the eddy current                   sensors.                                                                             The research results from this project will not only lead to               closed-loop computer control systems for improving HIP quality and              productivity, but may also be useful for the development of                     real-time feedback control systems for other material processing                systems.  If successful, the research will allow the production of              part from powdered metal with a high degree of consistency and                  shape accuracy, reducing scrap.",
