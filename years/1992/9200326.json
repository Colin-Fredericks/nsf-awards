 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Entomology at the                University of Illinois at Urbana to establish a summer research                 program that focuses on the behavior and neuroanatomy of honey                  bees.  Students will have the unique opportunity to combine                     compelling fieldwork with modern laboratory techniques.  Student                training will be a three-fold process.  First, lectures will be                 given on the structure and function of the insect nervous system;               the hormonal regulation of insect metamorphosis and neural                      development; the hormonal regulation of insect behavior; and                    experimental design.  Second, students will receive practical                   training in the safe handling of colonies of honey bees and in                  observation of honey bee behavior, and ample opportunity  to                    practice these new skills.  Third, students will also receive                   laboratory instruction in histological techniques for the light                 microscopic study of the insect nervous system.  Each student will              then carry out a research project in which an aspect of bee brain               morphology, cell number, neurochemistry, neurotransmitter                       expression, gene expression, or hormonal responsiveness etc. is                 studied in bees of known age and behavioral status.  The goal of                this project is to introduce students who already have an interest              in neuroscience and behavioral biology to the value of social                   insects as models for the study of the neurobiology of complex                  behavior.  This project represents and extension of an ongoing                  collaboration between two laboratories in the Department of                     Entomology and the Neuroscience Program at the University of                    Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  It will be based in the Bee Research             Facility and two other well-equipped laboratories in the Department             of Entomology.",
