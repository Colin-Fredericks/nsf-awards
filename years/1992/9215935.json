 "awd_abstract_narration": "To exploit the fact that many construction projects are planned and             work methods selectedbased on previous experience, a scheduling                 model using case-based reasoning is presented.  This model not                  only adapts previous cases to suit a new project to be                          scheduled; it also extracts and summarizes planning knowledge                   from several cases and stores that as part of its knowledge base                for future use.  Thus the storage problem that arises when keeping              many cases around is reduced, as planning knowledge is                          incrementally compiled.                                                                                                                                         To efficiently retrieve this compiled knowledge or the cases,                   CasePlan uses a product model that describes at a general                       level what design elements are present in projects and how they                 structurally or functionally relate to another.  The product model              is used for case classification and learning planning knowledge.                                                                                                                                                                                The research demonstrates the importance of product models in                   organizing and compiling knowledge.  The CasePlan system                        resulting from this research will also be a state-of-the-art                    automated scheduler for construction.  Its schedules will                       have enough detail to drive a discrete-event simulation of                      construction execution of the project, which can provide                        execution feedback and serve to assess the quality of CasePlan's                output.",
