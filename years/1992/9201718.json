 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal considers two essentially unrelated problems in              Bayesian statistics.  In the first,  a problem of long standing,                finding tractable non-Gaussian analogs of the Kalman model and                  filtering algorithm,  is studied.  Here a promising probability                 structure is introduced that seems to produce sensible recursive                filtering algorithms for discrete data.  The proposed work involves             the development and implementation of this model.  In the second,               the problem of finding improved interval estimates of a finite                  population mean or median is considered.  It is well-known that                 under simple random sampling without replacement with a moderate                sample from a skewed population,  the usual interval estimates                  perform poorly.  The same can be true in stratified random sampling             when the sample sizes within the strata are small.  Here a                      noninformative Bayesian approach,  which is based on a                          generalization of the 'Polya posterior',  is suggested as a method              for generating improved interval estimates.                                                                                                                          The principal investigator is an expert in the theory of                   finite sampling. His continued use of the Bayesian approach to                  problems in this area and in the development of filtering                       algorithms for discrete data is well worth pursuing.  The                       theoretical concepts have great potential for extension to other                estimation problems in finite sampling and the results should                   receive considerable attention.",
