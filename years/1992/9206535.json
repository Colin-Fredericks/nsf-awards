 "awd_abstract_narration": "Active movement of a class of 350 kDa glycoproteins within the               plane of the Chlamydomonas flagellar membrane is responsible for                whole cell gliding motility in this organism.  Plasma membrane                  protein dynamics may also be involved in many other forms of whole              cell locomotion along solid substrates or extracellular matrix.                 Contact of the flagellar membrane with a solid substrate is                     hypothesized to initiate a transmembrane signaling pathway that                 activates an intraflagellar motor responsible for binding to and                applying force to the flagellar membrane glycoproteins.                         Crosslinking of certain populations of flagellar membrane                       glycoproteins with anti-carbohydrate monoclonal antibodies is an                artificial means to initiate the signaling pathway (involving                   calcium influx and changes in protein phosphorylation) and result               in redistribution of the flagellar membrane proteins recognized by              the antibodies.  The present study is directed towards an                       elucidation of the role of protein phosphorylation in the signaling             pathway and the identification and characterization of the                      biological motor responsible for glycoproteins movements and hence              whole cell gliding motility.  Studies will address the regulated                association of flagellar membrane proteins and protein kinases with             the 350 Kda flagellar membrane glycoproteins, and the association               of phosphoproteins and other proteins in the membrane-matrix                    fraction with axonemal and brain microtubules.  An in vitro system              for studying flagellar membrane dynamics using inside-out flagellar             membrane vesicles and purified microtubules will be developed.                  Biological motor activity will be sought within the membrane-matrix             compartment using in vitro microtubule gliding assays.  The 3S                  calcium-specific ATPase in the membrane -matrix fraction will be                purified and characterized as a candidate motor.  Monoclonal                    antibodies to various flagellar membrane-matrix phosphoproteins and             to candidate motor proteins will be obtained for use as probes for              studying the role of these proteins in flagellar signaling and                  force production for glycoprotein movement and whole cell                       locomotion.                                                                     %%%                                                                             The unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas, is a widely used model               organism for studying a wide variety of biological questions.  The              alga has flagellae, which enable it to swim freely in aqueous                   media, in a manner which is functionally similar to other                       flagellar-propelled motilities in other organisms.  The                         Chlamydomonas flagellum has therefore been a highly productive                  model for studying the mechanism of flagellar motility in general.              In addition to the free-swimming mode of locomotion, Chlamydomonas              also exhibits a gliding motility on solid substrata, which also                 involves the flagellum, or, more specifically, the plasma membrane              surrounding the flagellum.  The mechanism of this gliding motility              has been traced to the active movement of certain membrane                      glycoproteins within the plane of the flagellar membrane.  It is                likely that this system will serve as a good general model for                  studying \"deliberate\" movements of membrane proteins within the                 plane of the membrane.",
