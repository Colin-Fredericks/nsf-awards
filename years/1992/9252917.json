 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project will create six hour-long, interactive                  broadcasts for junior high school students which are focused on the             contributions of females in the development and advancement of                  mathematics and science.  Students will see male and female role                models in their work place, learn about contemporary careers and                historical contributions, and participate in related mathematics                activities before and after the broadcast.  Following the                       broadcasts, the video materials will be professionally edited and               widely distributed for further use in schools.  Dissemination                   agreements made at the time of the award included the McDonnell                 Douglas Foundation, Women and Mathematics Education, Society of                 Women Engineers, and Western Illinois University Mathematics                    Resource Office and the Women's Center.                                                                                                                         Accompanying print materials will be developed for teacher and                  student use.  The materials will represent significant topics that              have extended use in the classroom.  Teachers will receive greater              background information on the role models and additional teaching               ideas.                                                                                                                                                          The formative evaluation will monitor the development and quality               of the broadcasts/videotapes and their effectiveness with students.                                                                                             The summative evaluation will evaluate data on course selection,                career plans, and recall of information about female role models.                //",
