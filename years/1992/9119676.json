 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robert Pecora is supported by a grant from the                        Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                      theoretical and experimental research on thermal motions in                     liquid and polymer systems.  Professor Pecora will emply a                      number of experimental methods including interferometry, photon                 correlation spectroscopy, forced Rayleigh scattering and                        transient electric birefringence to study dilute and non-dilute                 solutions of rigid and semi-rigid rod-like molecules.  He will                  also study composite solutions consisting of various                            combinations of rods, spheres, and coils.  Some of the rod-like                 molecules he will study are DNA restriction fragments.  The                     theoretical effort will involve both formal theoretical                         modeling and Brownian dynamics computer simulations.                            %%%                                                                             Composite liquids are a ubiquitous class of materials which                     contain polymer, particles and solvent.  They are used as                       ceramic precursors, lubricants, paints and coatings, adhesives,                 and in chromatographic columns.  Due to their complexity and                    the lack of adequate model systems, the interactions between                    the species in such systems are not well understood.  Pecora                    has constructed a model rod/sphere composite liquid whose                       dynamics can be studied over a wide range of composition of                     both the rods and the spheres using an experimental technique                   known as dynamic light scattering.",
