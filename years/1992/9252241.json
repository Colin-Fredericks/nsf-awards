 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hampshire College, although a relatively new institution, has                   a reputation for excellence in the teaching of science.                         Introductory courses for both science majors and non-majors                     focus on inquiry methods and often involve students in                          independent projects in the laboratory.  These relatively                       sophisticated student projects for beginners have become the                    hallmark of Hampshire's innovative science education.  Optics                   and Holography (NS 104) is such a course.  Using students                       natural enthusiasm for holograms and lasers we give them a good                 basis in physical optics and equip them to function in the                      holographic laboratory in a very independent way.  Students                     create transmission, reflection and rainbow holograms in 4x5                    format.  During the last third of the course, and continuing                    into the following semester students complete an entirely                       independent project on some aspect of holographic production,                   instrumentation or utilization, or on some closely related                      topic.  Improving the laboratory equipment for these courses                    has improved them in several ways:  1) eliminating the                          frustration caused by the touchiness our homebuilt equipment                    helps new students gain confidence and independence in the lab;                 and 2) improving image quality helps to maintain student                        enthusiasm during the sometimes difficult transition to                         independent work. Hampshire's project based approach to                         introductory science education has proved effective in                          attracting non-science students to the sciences.  A greatly                     expanded computational component aids student understanding and                 introduces them to a rapidly expanding field of physics.                        Hampshire annually graduates more than twice as many students                   majoring in science as entered with a declared interest in                      science.",
