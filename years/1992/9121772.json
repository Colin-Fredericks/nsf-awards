 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the extent of sex bias in selection               of research subjects in biological and behavioral research.  For                animal studies, scientific journals will be surveyed and data                   coded to determine the number of single sex studies, sex-                       comparative studies, observed sex differences and where                         generalization of research findings occurred from single-sex                    studies to the opposite sex of the same or other species without                apparent justification.  Then, the extent of sex bias in clinical               research with human subjects will be documented through a similar               survey of clinical research journals.  This inquiry will focus on               four major disorders affecting men and women:  AIDS/HIV                         infection, concer, coronary heart disease, and depression.  Once                relevant human studies have been identified, the investigators                  will look back to the animal experiments on which the clinical                  tests and trials were based, to determine if sex differences were               studied or whether generalizations were made from single sex                    animal studies.  This investigation would identify the extent,                  nature, and appropriateness of generalizing research findings                   from single sex studies and ultimately stimulate awareness of the               problems inherent in generalization and of the need for rigorous                sex-comparative research.  The investigators and advisors are                   well qualified; the project plan is good; the budget is very                    reasonable; results are likely to have intellectual and practical               significance.  The proposal is recommended for support with high                priority.",
