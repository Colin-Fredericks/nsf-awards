 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beginning in 1978, with the support of the National Science                     Foundation, the National Election Studies (NES) launched a series               of large scale and ambitious studies of elections to the U.S. House             of Representatives.  It is no exaggeration to say that these                    studies have revolutionized our understanding of voting in House                contests, and have energized the analysis of the House of                       Representatives as an institution as well.  But in the meantime,                our understanding of Senate elections languished.  How voters                   choose their Senators, how and how well Senators represent the                  interest of their constitutents, what kinds of campaigns Senators               and their opponents wage:  on such basic questions as these, we had             little to say.  The problem was not that Senate elections are                   theoretically innocuous; the study of Senate elections provides an              excellent and in some respects optimal entree to fundamental                    questions for American democratic politics.  Nor was it a case of               indifference on the part of the research community:  there was in               fact considerable and growing interest in the study of Senate                   elections.  The problem, rather, was the absence of suitable data.              The important theoretical and substantive questions occasioned by               Senate elections could not be resolved with the evidence at hand.               With this problem in mind, and with the support of the National                 Science Foundation, the Principal Investigators and the NES Board               of Overseers initiated in 1988 and 1990 the first two parts of a                three-part study of Senate elections.  The current project supports             completing the Senate election study in 1992.  The justification                for completing the study rests on the substantive and theoretical               advances that the 1992 study makes possible, for four themes                    especially: (1) political representation, of interest not least                 because contrary to original intentions, the contemporary Senate                appears to be more responsive to popular sentiment than the House;              (2) divided government, now the norm in the American system of                  separated powers, one that may menace coherent legislation and                  erode political accountability; (3) the nature and consequences of              political campaigns, motivated by the recognition that Senate                   elections provide an opportunity to examine the interplay among                 candidates, the political institutions governing elections, and                 voters in a particularly powerful way; and (4) the \"simple act of               voting,\" developing and testing comparative theories of voter                   choice.                                                                         Provisional analysis of the first two phases of the NES Senate                  election Study suggest that the complete study proposed here will               trigger the same kind of explosion of research that the 1978                    National Election Study set off for our understanding of the House.             Indeed, the gains are likely to be greater here.  The Senate                    Election study builds upon research on House and Presidential                   elections, and is carefully coordinated, theoretically and                      operationally, with ongoing NES studies.  The research is                       comparative, contributing broadly to theories of voting,                        representation, campaigns, and, ultimately to our understanding of              American electoral institutions.",
