The work focuses on the geometric properties of                        quasiextremal distance domains.  These are domains characterized                by the property that points and closed sets can be joined by                    curves within the domain whose lengths do not be arbitrarily                    long.  They are singled out because they have the characteristics               believed to be fundamental for the study of quasiconformal                      mappings.  Work on this project will concentrate on showing how                 the modulus of quasiextremal distance domains carries over to the               dilatation constant for quasiconformal mapping defined on them.                 A second line of research will consider the length of level sets                of univalent mappings and the question of the largest power to                  which such a mapping's derivative has a finite integral.                             Complex function theory encompasses the study of                           differentiable functions of a complex variable and related                      classes of functions such as harmonic functions and                             quasiconformal mappings.  The subject is highly geometric; many                 of the problems concern the properties of various sets under                    transform by functions from one of the above classes.                           Applications of the theory to potential theory and fluid dynamics               is now standard in engineering circles",
