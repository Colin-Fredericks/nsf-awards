 "awd_abstract_narration": "Perceiving the three-dimensional environment on the basis of the                two-dimensional images projected onto the retinas of the two eyes               requires integration of different sources of depth information.                 This project will examine the integration of two types of depth                 information, i.e., viewer-centered information, which provides                  relative distances between an observer and objects in the                       environment, and object-centered information, which provides                    relative distances within an external scene, independent of viewer              location.  The viewer-centered information that will be studied                 will include binocular disparity (differences in the object's                   projection onto the retinas of the two eyes as a function of                    relative distances from the observer) and motion parallax                       (variations in the velocities projected onto the eye as a function              of distance from the observer).  The object-centered information of             primary interest is structure-from-motion (use of changing                      distances in the projection to recover distances between features               on a three-dimensional object, under an assumption of rigid                     motion).  One series of experiments will examine how the perceived              three-dimensional shapes of objects are determined by the                       partitioning of motion in the retinal images into viewer-centered               and object-centered components (motion parallax and structure-from-             motion).  A second series of experiments will examine integration               of shape recovered from object-centered information into a viewer-              centered representation of the three-dimensional environment.  A                third series of experiments will examine the changes in the                     perceived shapes and orientations of objects that occurs when                   information indicating lack of depth is added to a three-                       dimensional scene.  A fourth series of experiments will determine               the minimum number of visible features on an object needed to                   detect a surface from a combination of viewer-centered information              (binocular disparity) and object-centered information (structure-               from-motion).  The objective of this research is to understand how              different types of depth information are combined to provide an                 integrated perception of the three-dimensional environment.  This               has relevance for such issues as optimizing human performance in                object recognition in actual three-dimensional environments and                 designing artificial three-dimensional displays, including displays             for flight simulators and aircraft displays that represent the                  virtual environment.",
