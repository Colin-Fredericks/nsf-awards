The Connecticut Logic Seminar has met weekly since 1974.                   Its participants now include the logicians from the University of               Connecticut, Wesleyan, Vassar, Southeastern Massachusetts                       University, and Yale, as well as other faculty from regional                    schools.  Weekly meetings are held on a rotating basis at                       Connecticut, Wesleyan, Vassar and Yale.  The seminar typically                  ranges over most of current interest in logic, and reflects the                 interests of the participants and invited speakers.  From time to               time, an extended period is spent investigating as topic in                     depth, as was done most recently with Hrushovski's examples of                  new strongly  minimal sets.  The seminar is of great value not                  only to the participating faculty, but to their graduate                        students.",
