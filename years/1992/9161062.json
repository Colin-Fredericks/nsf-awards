 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical lithography is widely used in the manufacture of                        integrated circuits.  The current systems utilize conventional I-               line (356nm wavelength) lamps or to illuminate the lenses that                  print the IC patterns onto wafers.  Future systems will use                     laser.  All of the lithography optics used to date have been the                refractive type.  At the short ultraviolet (UV) laser wavelengths               required for next generation device manufacturing, several                      limitations exist for this type of lens.  These limitations                     include light scattering because of shot wavelengths, heat                      absorption due to high photon energies in the UV, and optical                   transmission losses (poor efficiency) from high absorption of the               light.                                                                                                                                                          The PI propose to develop a catadioptric optical system that has                high optical transmission, high resolution, is laser-resistant,                 and relatively easy to manufacture.  Because the optics are                     mirror-based, optical distortion is greatly reduced and very high               power levels can be used without damaging the optics.  We have                  made preliminary experiments in our lab with this type of optics,               and achieved 0.4um resolution.  The development of this type of                 lens would lead to significant improvements in the high                         resolution imaging systems for VLSI microlithography, a critical                step in manufacturing integrate circuits.",
