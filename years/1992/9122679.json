 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research has indicated that there is a                                   formal electrical duality between electrons in                                  semiconductors and fluxons in superconducting                                   thin films.  Magnetic flux can be transported                                   across a superconductor only via fluxons (or                                    vortices), in analogy to charge transport across                                a semiconductor via electrons and holes.  A                                     fluxon of either polarity is driven by a current                                and produces an electric field in the same way                                  that an electron or hole is driven by an                                        electric field and produces a current.                                          Superconducting devices that are dual to                                        unipolar semiconducting devices (such as the                                    field-effect transistor) have recently been                                     demonstrated.  The proposed research will go                                    further to design and fabricate simple bipolar                                  fluxonic elements that are the duals to                                         semiconducting bipolar junction diodes and                                      transistors.  A bipolar fluxonic transistor is a                                three-terminal active superconducting device                                    that can exhibit substantial voltage gain.                                      These devices will be prepared by patterning                                    of high-temperature superconducting YBCO                                        thin films, without the need to fabricate                                       Josephson tunnel junctions or other more                                        complex structures.  The research will seek to                                  determine whether these new devices may                                         provide a promising new approach for the                                        next generation of superconducting integrated                                   circuit technology.",
