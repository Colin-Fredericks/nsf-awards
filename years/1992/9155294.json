 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a four summer program to provide inservice                      education, in the areas of cellular and molecular biology                       and biotechnology, for 192 (48 per year) general and                            advanced level high school biology teachers from Arizona and                    surrounding states.  Special attention will be given to the                     recruitment of teachers of minority students and to the                         needs of minority students.  Emphasis will also be placed on                    giving biology teachers the competency and confidence to                        emphasize modern biotechnology in the classroom,                                incorporating laboratory investigations to their fullest,                       and also to the use of computer and media technology in                         biology education.                                                                                                                                              The program is based upon several years of pilot study and                      includes a three week summer institute at Northern Arizona                      University and academic year follow-up.  Highly qualified,                      experienced, precollege teachers will provide a significant                     portion of the institute instruction.  Participants will be                     required to share activities with fellow teachers via local                     inservice activities.                                                                                                                                           Cost sharing equals 9.3% of the NSF award.",
