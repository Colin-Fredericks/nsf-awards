It has been approved by             the National Science Board (NSF-92-104).  Funding for various tasks             within the proposal originate from a variety of sources.                             The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office or the Department               of Defense is providing $950,000 for one year to fund a portion of              task 3.4 in the proposal.                                                            The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the                       Department of Defense is providing $938,000 for one year to fund a              portion of task 3.2 in the proposal.                                                 The U.S. Army Industrial Engineering Activity at Rock Island               Arsenal is providing $100,000 for one year for a membership and to              fund a portion of task 3.3.4 in the proposal.                                        Goddard Space Flight Center of NASA is providing $70,000 for               one year to fund a portion of task 3.1.1 and another $86,000 for                one year to fund a portion of task 3.5.                                              The U.S. Army Tank Command (TACOM) is providing $100,000 for               one year to fund a portion of task 3.1.1 in the proposal.                            The Program Manager recommends the University of Iowa be                   awarded $2,244,000 for one year under a three-year continuing award             for $17,029,786.",
