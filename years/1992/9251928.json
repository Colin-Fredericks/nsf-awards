First, the collection and                 management of large amounts of archaeological data using a                      computer based automatic data collection system.  These are                     becoming typical of large archaeological projects, but only                     rarely is any training in their use available.  The second                      focus of the lab is on instruction about, and the analysis of                   image data.  This will have a twofold purpose, first to allow                   the teaching of methods and techniques involved in analyzing                    overall artifact shape via high resolution images, and second,                  to allow instruction of large groups in the nature and analysis                 of microwear (using video microscopy) on both bone and stone                    tools.",
