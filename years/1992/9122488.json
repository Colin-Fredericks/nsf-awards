 "awd_abstract_narration": "Models using survey data typically assume that respondents                 report their behavior accurately.  In fact, however,  these models              may be flawed due to bias and imprecision in the survey data                    collection process.  The sources of error of self-reports are                   numerous, reflecting a combination of the characteristrics of                   individual respondents and the nature of the survey instrument and              the way it is administered.                                                          This research focuses on gender differences in self-reporting              on several topics,  including sexual behavior,  where primary                   emphasis is put,  illicit drug use and abortion. It will be carried             out in conjunction with the investigators' National Center for                  Health Statistics project entitled,  \"Cognitive Research on Health              Promotion and Disease Prevention\".                                                   Numerous surveys,  both in the United States and in other                  countries,  have shown that men report more sex partners than women             do.  This difference persists even when homosexual partners are                 excluded and when adjustments are made for extreme values,  item                non-response,  population size,  and related matters.  The                      differences become larger as the time frame covered by the                      questions grow longer.  The most plausible explanation for the                  difference is that the two genders differ in the direction and/or               magnitude of their response errors -- either the men are                        overreporting,  the women underreporting,  or both.                                  A series of related studies will be carried  out to examine                these gender differences in the reports of sexual partners as well              as reports on other sexual behaviors,  drug use,  and abortions.                They consist of 1)  cognitive interviews exploring the                          understanding of sexual terms and willingness to discuss sexual                 matters,  2)  a bogus pipeline experiment to test whether assumed               validation of self-reports will change the reports of men and                   women,  3)  a survey experiment to test differences in response                 format,  recall cues,  and interviewing staff,  4)  a second survey             experiment to test differences in mode of administration,  place                of interview,  questionaire context, and question wording,  and                 5) a third survey experiment to test anonymity vs. confidentiality.                  These studies should identify the factors that lead to                     misreports of sensitive behaviors about sexual partners,                        abortions,  and drug use;  contribute to the design of an optimal               measurement strategy;  and provide improved estimates of the true               incidence levels of these sensitive behaviors.  It is crucial that              work of this sort be conducted,  particularly in view of questions              raised by the AIDS epidemic and the potential extent of its                     applications.",
