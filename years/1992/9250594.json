 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Computational Physics Laboratory has been equipped with ten                   microcomputers networked to a server with a variety of software                 for use by all physics majors at Ohio University.  The                          laboratory is a crucial part of our plan to integrate the                       computer into the undergraduate physics curriculum at all                       levels.  The goal is to use computers (their power,                             flexibility, and graphics) as a tool to aid in conceptualizing                  physics.  The conceptual insight provided by computer                           simulations and exercises stimulates the imagination of our                     physics majors, leading to improved retention and better                        prepared graduates.  We are using existing software whenever                    possible, and are serving as a testing site for the (NSF                        funded) CUPS program of software development for upper-level                    physics courses.  Software based on a common set of utilities                   provided by CUPS and MUPPET is also being developed.  We                        believe the correlated introduction of computers into physics                   courses will have a profound effect on the quality of physics                   graduates and future physics curricula.",
