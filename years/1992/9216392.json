 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this SGER proposal is to isolate clones for                       cytoplasmic dynein chains from a budding yeast (S. cerevisiae)                  genomic library, with the long term aim of studying molecular                   aspects of dynein structure and function.  Degenerate primers and               PCR have generated a 300 bp probe that appears to hybridize with                dynein cDNA. The project calls for the further characterization of              the genomic clones that hybridize with the probe.  A series of                  restriction maps are planned to determine whether these clones                  actually encode yeast dynein(s). The second major aim of the                    project is to generate a null mutation in diploid yeast cells to                assess the role of the gene product in growth, cell division, and               mating. The experiments are carefully-planned, well-controlled and              provide alternative strategies in the event that the primary plan               of attack is unsuccessful.                                                      %%%                                                                                The significance of this work is potentially high because this               work could alter our understanding of the molecular structure of                this immense mechanochemical protein complex in ways that have been             impossible thusfar. The risk in this project is fairly evident; it              is not at all clear that budding yeast requires significant levels              of dynein to survive.  The functional studies involving the null                mutant(s) may be totally equivocal.  Another possibility is that                null mutations for cytoplasmic dynein could be lethal.  If the null             mutants survive, but fail to develop properly, the role for a                   cytoplasmic dynein may be finally established.  This is an                      important project that entails a high risk, but has a potentially               significant payoff.",
