 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort is to explore the improvements in hole quality and             drill life of micro-drills used in the printed circuit board                    manufacturing industry, by the utilization of helical points on the             drills rather than planar points that are currently utilized.                   A new geometrical model that describes a helical point on a micro               -drill will be developed.  Based on this model a kinematic                      mechanism will be designed and fabricated to grind helical points               on micro-drills.  The availability of helically-pointed                         micro-drills is essential to explore improvements in performance                and life that appear to be                                                      theoretically feasible.  This feasibility is based on the fact that             helical points offer a much higher clearance angle distribution                 along the drill's cutting edge, without weakening the edge, in                  comparison to planar pointed drills.                                                 This effort that deals only with micro-drills in combination               with the large dollar volume of the printed circuit board industry              and it's strategic importance to the electronic industry, makes                 this a high risk venture with a significant potential for large                 pay-offs.",
