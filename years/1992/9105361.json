 "awd_abstract_narration": "Activation of non-excitable cells leads to an increase in                     intracellular calcium and the generation of other intracellular                 signals which together initiate the physiological response.                     Single-cell studies of stimulus-response coupling in non-excitable              cells are proposed, using two immune effector cells, the mast cell              and the eosinophil, as model systems.  The mast cell has been a                 valuable model for many years.  In contrast, remarkably little is               known about signal transduction in eosinophils, in spite of their               importance in a variety of immne responses.  Studies on mast cells              will continue to utilize the well-established rat basophilic                    leukemia cell line.  Guinea pig eosinophils will be used for more               preliminary studies of signal transduction in eosinophils.                      Quantitative image enhanced microscopy will be used to measure                  Ca2+, membrane potential, exocytosis and chemotaxis in single                   cells. In many cases more than one of these parameters can be                   monitored simultaneously in many individual cells.                              Electrophysiologcal measurements, utilizing the perforated patch                configuration of the whole cell recording technique, will be used               to identify calcium currents or any other conductances that are                 activated in response to various stimuli.  Simultaneous                         measurements of intracellular Ca2+, ionic current, and exocytosis               are also planned.  The long term goal is to identify the mechanisms             by which intracellular Ca2+ is increased and to determine what                  aspects of the Ca2+ signal are important in the exocytotic and/or               chemotactic response of a cell.                                                                                                                                 When mast cells or eosinophils interact with certain protein or                 peptide effectors (such as immunoglobulins), the effectors bind to              receptors on the surfaces of these cells and result in a specific               physiological response (such as secretion of the contents of                    specific storage granules).  The question addressed in these                    studies is how the binding of a receptor at the outside of the cell             results in the physiological response, a phenomenon termed                      stimulus-response coupling.  It has already been established that               intracellular calcium is increased as a result of stimulation, and              that the increased calcium levels leads to the generation of other              intracellular signals culminating in the response.  This project                will probe the role of calcium in stimulus-response coupling, using             a combination of novel and established techniques (sometimes                    simultaneously) in order to extend our understanding of the                     mechanism of this form of transmembrane signal transduction.",
