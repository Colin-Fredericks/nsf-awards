 "awd_abstract_narration": "In support of the TOGA/COARE objectives, this project is a                 study of the surface radiative processes in the western Pacific                 warm pool region.  The objective of the program is to provide                   analyses of:  sea-surface \"skin\" temperature, precipitable water,               cloud properties, and components of the surface longwave and                    shortwave radiative fluxes, with spatial resolution of 30 km and                temporal resolution of 3 hours for the entire TOGA COARE primary                domain.   The data for the analyses will be obtained principally                by satellite remote sensing, with the ISCCP data set and                        algorithms playing a substantial role.  Available surface and                   aircraft data will be utilized to validate the remote sensing                   algorithms and will also be blended with the satellite retrievals               for the final analysis products.  An aircraft sub-program is                    proposed specifically to investigate cloud-radiative properties,                and to validate the satellite-derived surface fluxes.                                The proposed research will be accomplished in three stages:                i) remote sensing pilot study to develop and compare satellite                  algorithms; ii) validation of remote sensing algorithms using                   TOGA COARE IOP surface and aircraft observations and preparation                of high-resolution analyses for the IOP; and iii) diagnostic and                studies modeling studies utilizing the analyzed fields.                         Diagnostic fluxes by synoptic and mesoscale atmospheric focing                  will be conducted.  The temporal response of the ocean mixed                    layer to fluctuations in the surface radiative fluxes will be                   examined using an ocean mixed-layer model.  The ocean mixed-layer               model will be coupled to an atmospheric radiative-convective                    model to assess the radiative and cloud feedbacks occurring                     between the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers.                                 This research is important because it serves as one of the                 principal TOGA/COARE studies of the processes responsible for                   sensitive region of the world, the western Pacific Ocean, the                   field site of TOGA/COARE.",
