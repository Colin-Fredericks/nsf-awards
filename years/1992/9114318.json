 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is strong empirical evidence that the areal extent of                Eurasian spring snow cover is negatively correlated with the                    following summer rainfall over rainfall over India.  The purpose of             this research is to study the validity of this empirical                        relationship from a series of experiments with a general                        circulation model (GCM).  The GCM is a global spectral model with               rhomboidal truncation at wave number 40 horizontal resolution with              18 layers in the vertical.  The physical processes include: surface             biophysical processes, diurnal cycle, shallow and deep convection,              cloud-radiation interaction and effects of large-scale and subgrid-             scale orography.  Three experiments are proposed with varying areal             extent and depth of the Eurasian snow cover in the spring to study              its influence on the summer monsoon circulations.  All three                    experiments will simulate ensemble global circulations in an annual             cycle mode from March 1 though September 30.  The difference in                 these simulations are only due to the prescribed snow extent and                depth over Eurasia on March 1.  All other prescribed quantities                 will come from climatology.  The first experiment is to determine               the impact of a negative anomaly in the snow extent on the monsoon              circulations by prescribing a minimum snow extent similar to that               observed during the spring of 1970.  In this experiment the PI will             use average snow depth.  The second and third experiments are                   designed to investigate the impact of a positive anomaly in the                 snow extent similar to that observed during the spring of 1972.  In             the second experiment the PI prescribe a minimum snow depth in                  order to isolate the effects of the surface albedo.  In the third               experiment he will prescribe a maximum snow in order to study the               effects of albedo as well as the effects of melting and                         evaporation.  The results of these anomaly experiments will be                  compared with the control simulations to test the statistical                   significance of these results..This research is important because               it seeks to improve our understanding of relationships between                  important components of the climate system, surface boundary                    forcing and monsoons.",
