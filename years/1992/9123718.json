 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is in                 the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                 subfield of bioanalysis.  It is jointly supported by the Division               of Chemistry and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive              Research (EPSCoR) Office.  During the tenure of this three-year                 continuing grant, Professor Asouzu and his students will develop                and study enzyme immunoassay methods and immunosensors.  The                    incorporation of avidin, streptavidin, biotin, and their enzyme                 and antibody conjugates into immunoassays and immunosensor design               will be evaluated.  Enzymes and antibodies will be used in both                 their solubilized and immobilized forms.  Enzyme immunoassay                    techniques will be combined with flow injection analysis and                    amperometric detection to develop a multi-antigen immunoassay                   method.                                                                         %%%                                                                             This project includes a well-conceived, multi-step paradigm for                 introducing undergraduate students, including freshmen, to                      applications of enzymes and enzyme kinetic methods for                          bioanalysis.  The research is expected not only to lead to new                  developments in this rapidly expanding field, but also to                       contribute strongly to the research and training infrastructure of              Troy State University and enable Professor Asouzu, a minority                   investigator, to initiate a competitive research program.",
