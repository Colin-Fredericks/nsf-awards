The tribological properties of novel                      fluorinated ultra-thin films will be investigated.  The films are               composed of molecules which are designed to spontaneously absorb                to solid surfaces, self-assemble, and anchor as monolayers.  The                polymer architectures combine amphilic structures which self-                   organic as monomers, produce highly ordered polymeric Langmuir-                 Blodgett films, and incorporate mobility and assembly via                       flexible linkages.  Thin film chemistry will use a flexible, low                surface energy siloxane backbone, which has been derivatized with               self-assembling, terminally functionalized, long hydrocarbon                    alkyl chains for surface chemisorption, as well as mobile                       perfluoroalky side chains for enhanced friction properties.",
