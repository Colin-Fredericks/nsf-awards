 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physical basis for our understanding of the stellar                         evolutionary is ultimately measured in the success of computational             models of stellar structure.  The Principal Investigator (PI) has               devoted his career to computing models of stars that permit an                  understanding of how stars evolve in time from one position on the              \"H R Diagram\" to another.  In the last three years the PI has begun             to extend his expertise to the difficult problems of the evolution              of binary stars, the accretion of hydrogen-rich material onto white             dwarfs and its subsequent gravitational settling and mixing, time-              dependent computations of \"slow\" neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.               A substantial part of the PI's new work will include hydrodynamical             simulations of accretion and mixing.  He will continue a vigorous               collaboration with M. Fujimoto and his collaborators in Japan to                include multi-dimensional hydrodynamical physics into his model                 interior computer codes.  It is anticipated that this marriage will             facilitate added theoretical expertise to both Japanese and U.S.                astronomy.",
