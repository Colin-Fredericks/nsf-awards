 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at improving our ability to understand, predict               and control macroeconomic developments at the national and                      international level.  Long term trend movements in the economy,                 at time scales exceeding the span of data we have available,                    raise special problems for inference that are just beginning to                 be addressed by econometricians.  This project will develop ideas               for approaching these problems in a Bayesian framework -- making                explicit the separate contributions of the data and of                          information from other sources (prior beliefs) to knowledge of                  long term dynamic behavior.  A special emphasis will be on                      extending the recent results in this area for univariate models                 to more practically relevant multivariate models.                                                                                                               There is disagreement among macroeconomists on the importance of                monetary policy and other forms of aggregate nominal demand                     management in generating or offsetting business cycles.                         Increasing our understanding in this area is important not only                 for improving demand management policy, but also in guiding the                 restructuring our banking system is undergoing.  The                            international facts about relations among the main macroeconomics               aggregates are only beginning to be documented and understood.                  Patterns of responses to innovations (surprise changes) in                      monetary variables appear in preliminary work surprisingly robust               across countries, time periods, and lists of variables included                 in the system.  This research will document these regularities.                 These regularities present difficulties for simple standard                     theories.  For example, Keynesian or monetarist theories view                   monetary policy as a major independent influence on the business                cycle.  Real business cycle theories treat it as passive and                    unimportant because of the smooth dynamic functioning of product                and asset markets.  This research will explore possible                         interpretations of the regularities, using several kinds of new                 and recently developed modeling strategies.",
