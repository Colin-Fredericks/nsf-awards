Development of this trap                 was funded through the NSF as part of the U.S. JGOFS program and                represents an effort to acquire very high resolution time-series                samples of the downward flux of particles in surface (<300m)                    waters.  The technology represents a combination of the proven                  Honjo time-series rotator mechanism and the MULTITRAP multiple                  collector PIT (Particle Interceptor Trap) used in the VERTEX                    (Vertical Transfer and Exchange), RACER (Research on Antarctic                  Ecosystem Rates), ADIOS (Asian Dust Input to the Oceanic System),               and NABE (JGOFS North Atlantic Bloom Experiment) Programs, and                  which is now used at the JGOFS time-series stations in Bermuda                  (BATS, Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series) and Hawaii (HOTS, Hawaii                   Ocean Time-Series).  The new technology was developed to address                shortcomings inherent in earlier designs, and has been                          successfully field tested.  The project will deploy this trap in                a study aimed at determining the scales of variability occurring                in the downward flux of total mass, carbon and nitrogen, their                  links to surface productivity, and the temporal changes in both                 export production and f ratio.",
