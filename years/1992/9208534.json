 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many problems of shared resources, often termed \"public goods,\"              or problems where the decision outcome of one person depends highly             on the behavior of others, important research questions arise about             the nature of trust and cooperative or defective behavior.  In such             situations, cooperation works to the advantage of the group but                 individuals are privately better off not cooperating.  Experimental             evidence from games that reflect the conditions of highly                       interdependent outcomes and optional participation, shows that (1)              people who intend cooperation are more willing than defectors to                enter into such situations (i.e. to \"trust\"); (2) cooperators are               relatively more successful regarding rewards from the experimental              games than the defectors, hence the term, \"cooperators' advantage;\"             and (3) neither intending cooperators nor intending defectors have              special capacity to recognize the intentions of strangers, meaning              that the cooperators' advantage comes exclusively from the                      disproportionate probability of participation with other                        cooperators.  This suggests that players decide to participate by               a heuristic where they project their own intentions to others.                  This research will further test the robustness of these results by              investigating the effects of experience on the heuristic that gives             rise to the cooperators' advantage.  Competing hypotheses predict:              (1) that repeated \"sampling\" of partners from the population pool               will lead expectations to converge such that the cooperators'                   advantage is eliminated; or (2) that available samples of others'               behavior are biased and provide both intending cooperators and                  intending defectors with confirming evidence of their original                  expectations and thus, stimulate little adjustment from experience.             These hypotheses will be tested by providing subjects with various              types of feedback about the choices of others.  The findings will               bear on the possibility of cooperation evolving independently of                tit-for-tat or other incentive-based mechanisms discussed in the                literature.",
