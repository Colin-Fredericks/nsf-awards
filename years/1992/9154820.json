This project will give students and the                          general public a dynamic view of the period of time known as                    the Age of Reptiles.  It emphasizes experience with                             interactive exhibits that focus on concepts of geologic                         time, how species adapt and change, relative size, scale and                    time, the activities of scientists as role models, and it                       provides reinforcement of these experiences for students in                     the classroom.  This project includes the first use in a                        museum of SemNet, a software program designed for concept                       mapping and the representation of knowledge networks, which                     will be used with a videodisc.  Prototypes of all                               interactive exhibits will undergo formative evaluation to                       establish maximal audience accessibility, ease of use and                       educational effectiveness.  The exhibit concepts will be                        disseminated throughout the state of Nebraska through mini-                     versions, teachers in-service training, and scientist-in-                       residence programs.  This project will also be used as a                        teaching laboratory for the University of Nebraska's                            graduate program in Museum Studies.",
