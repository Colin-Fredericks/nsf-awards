 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr.                  K.C. Yeh of the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana and Dr.                 Andrzej W. Wernik of the Radiophysics Laboratory, Space                         Research Center, Polish Academy of Science is to study satellite                radio beacon scintillation.  These studies will provide information             about irregular structure of the ionosphere.  Recent interest in                coupling process between the solar wind, magnetosphere and                      ionosphere has lead to an increased activity in the high-latitude               ionosphere studies.  Past cooperative projects on scintillation                 measurements have been at the Polish Polar Station at Spitsbergen.              Using these data, the researchers will:  (1)  Study more extensively            the morphology of scintillation in the auroral, polar cap and polar             cusps regions accessible from the Station; (2) Model the                        highlatitude scintillation avoiding assumptions apparently not                  satisfied at high latitudes, namely that fluctuations of the electron           density are random with a spectrum which has the same form along                and across magnetic field, and compare with observations; (3)                   Apply the approach used in the nonlinear system studies to                      scintillation and in-situ electron density data.  This research will            obtain fuller description of the high-latitude scintillation                    morphology, to improve the scintillation theory, to gain more                   information about the ionospheric irregular structure at high                   latitudes.                                                                                                                                                      This project in electrical and computer engineering fulfills the                program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                 leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine              complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual              interest and competence.",
