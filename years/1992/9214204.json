 "awd_abstract_narration": "Saint Mary's College requires its biology                                  majors to conduct an original research project and                              to write an undergraduate thesis.  Undergraduate                                research and research training are key curricular                               components in developing graduates who go on to                                 advanced degrees in the life sciences.  Saint                                   Mary's is ranked the number one Catholic college                                or university in the nation in the ratio of                                     graduates going on to earn the Ph.D.  This                                      commitment to undergraduate research serves to                                  create an unusually \"research active\" faculty.                                       A new addition meets the needs of traditional                              fields of cellular and molecular biology,                                       genetics, anatomy and physiology, etc.  Renovation                              of three research facilities is essential to: 1)                                build on our successful environmental program; 2)                               continue to obtain outside research support; 3)                                 provide more research opportunities for both staff                              and students; 4) provide the best possible                                      research training for students; and 5) make the                                 facilities handicap-accessible.                                                      The more efficient renovated facilities will                               increase both the quantity and diversity of                                     research and research training, increase student                                retention and recruitment and, ultimately result                                in more students entering graduate school and                                   eventually scientific careers.  Outside                                         researchers also will make use of the remodeled                                 facilities.",
