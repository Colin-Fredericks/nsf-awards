 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports three investigators working on various                 aspects of problems combining several complex variables and                     partial differential equations. One primary focus will be                       continuing research on the regularity of two first order                        differential operators, the complex derivative d-bar which                      measures the degree to which a function is holomorphic and the                  associated operator restricted to manifolds or domain boundaries                called the d-bar-b operator.  The study of regularity is governed               by sub-elliptic inequalities.  Regularity is analyzed both                      locally and globally through these inequalities, and will be                    considered both in the analytic sense as well as that of infinite               differentiability. Related to regularity, and possibly one of the               strongest motivations for studying it, is the question of how                   smooth the boundary values of a function remain after projection                onto the space of holomorphic functions on a domain.  A concrete                expression for the projection is given by integration against the               Bergman kernel.  A second thrust of this project is to understand               the boundary behavior of the Bergman kernel on various kinds of                 domains, especially those of finite type. A third, somewhat more                geometric line of work concerns the regularity theory of level                  surfaces, problems of crystal growth and degenerate equations.                  Level surfaces of solutions of differential equations, expecially               those which analyze the level sets of viscosity solutions of heat               equations will be studied.  Among the most fundamental questions                to be considered is one due to De Giorgi, which seeks the                       regularity of the surfaces as a function of a parameter in the                  differential equation.                                                               Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them.",
