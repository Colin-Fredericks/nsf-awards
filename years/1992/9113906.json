 "awd_abstract_narration": "Persistent, stable and shallow domes of cold air dammed to the             west by the eastern slopes of the southern Appalachian mountains                are a common mesoscale feature in the late fall and winter. Because             of the neighboring, much warmer Atlantic waters to the east, this               cold air damming is a major factor in distinguishing forecasts of               rain from those of the more dangerous frozen precipitation forms                (snow, sleet, freezing drizzle and rain). When it is present and                persistent it also favors the rapid genesis and intensification of              coastal winter storms. Unfortunately, inadequate resolution of the              observational, analysis and forecast systems, as well as a lack of              theoretical understanding, have caused poor forecasts of these                  events. Similar phenomena also occur along Colorado's Front Range,              affecting the distribution of heavy snow in the Denver-Fort Collins             urban corridor, and have been documented on other mountain slopes               around the world. Xu's goal is to improve our understanding of cold             air damming and to develop quantitative criteria for the diagnosis              and short term forecasting of its consequences.  He is an                       outstanding younger investigator and is recognized as one of the                leading group of theoretical hydrodynamicists considering concrete              weather forecasting problems.",
