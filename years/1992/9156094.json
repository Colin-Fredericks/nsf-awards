 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding for a week-long, faculty workshop,                  LABSHOP, for 36 participants, to develop laboratory exercises                   suitable for introductory, multiple-section biology courses                     that promote an active student involvement via a problem-                       solving or SAAW0K-type approach.  The problem-solving                           instructional approach, best employed in the laboratory                         classroom, can provide a more self-directed, investigative,                     learning environment that can help solve the science education                  problem.  LABSHOP will bring together an interdisciplinary                      group of participants to work in teams on selected topics.  The                 final products of LABSHOP will be a variety of student-ready,                   laboratory exercises that employ a                                              problem/solving/investigative instructional approach.  To                       encourage a continuing dialogue among LABSH0P participants, to                  explore new approaches and teaching techniques, to encourage                    communication among biologists concerned with the quality of                    introductory laboratory instruction, to disseminate the LABSHOP                 products, and to promote innovation among an even larger,                       interdisciplinary group of biologists, a free, computer                         bulletin board, BIOLAB, will be established by this project.",
