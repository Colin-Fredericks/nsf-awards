 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves an integrated petrographic and stable                isotopic study of samples selected from core obtained during                    drilling in the Creede Formation of southwestern Colorado for the               purpose of documenting progressive changes in the oxygen, sulfur                and carbon isotopic compositions of secondary minerals which                    precipitated from pore fluids during the course of diagenesis and               hydrothermal activity in the Creede hydrothermal system.  The                   textural relationships and mineral compositions of pore-filling,                fracture-filling, and wall rock alteration minerals will be                     examined in order to establish the relative timing of secondary                 mineral precipitation.  Laser-based in situ extraction techniques               will be employed whenever possible to measure oxygen and sulfur                 isotopes in fine-grained minerals and test for isotopic variation               within minerals.  Oxygen (and to a lesser extent sulfur and carbon)             isotopic partitioning between appropriate minerals will be measured             and combined with experimentally and theoretically derived                      fractionation factors in order to constrain temperatures of                     precipitation.  The measured isotopic compositions of oxygen,                   sulfur, and carbon in secondary mineral minerals will be combined               with temperature constraints and mineral-fluid fractionation                    factors to calculate the stable isotopic compositions of the                    solutions from which the minerals precipitated.  The sequence of                stable isotopoic variation reconstructed from data for the                      secondary minerals will be used to assess the relative importance               of closed-system processes (e.g. local fluid-rock reaction) and                 open-system processes (e.g. groundwater or hydrothermal fluid                   influx) in controlling the isotopic compositions of oxygen, sulfur,             and carbon in the pore fluids.",
