 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study integrates archaeological and                           paleoecological research to examine the mechanisms through which                the pre-Hispanic Andean state of Tiwanaku generated extensive                   land-use changes that altered local ecosystems in such a way that               renewable resource production, particularly agriculture and                     possibly fisheries, was sustained for nearly a millennium.  Five                research objectives converge on the issue of changing human                     environment interactions in the study area adjacent to Lake                     Titicaca:  1. to describe lake-level variation during the past                  5000 years, the major period of human occupation; 2. to analyze                 Holocene climate variation in the altiplano both by using lake-                 level variation as input to water- and energy-budget                            (climatinomy) models, and by using stratigraphic variations of                  stable oxygen and carbon isotopes to measure the region's                       hydrological balance; 3. to reconstruct the spatial and temporal                dynamics of raised-field agriculture in the study area by                       topographic mapping, systematic test excavations and ground                     penetrating radar; 4. to model agricultural space-time                          systematics in the context of explicit hypotheses regarding                     hydrological and climatic control of raised fields with                         Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques; and 5. to                      determine changes of erosion and deposition processes and soil                  nutrient loss coincident with distinct types of farming                         practices.  The results of this research may hold broad                         implications for understanding the ecological and organizational                bases of resource sustainability in harsh environments.  This                   long-term view of different nutrient-retaining capacities of at                 least two different kinds of agricultural practices, raised                     fields (which are found throughout the tropics in inundated                     areas) and traditional dry-farmed fields may be useful in                       agronomy and agroecology.   Finally, studies of global climate                  change may benefit form a finer-scaled picture of the past                      several thousand years in the Lake Titicaca basin, as well as                   from the attempt to separate, in the paleoecological record,                    effects of human activities from natural climatic variation.",
