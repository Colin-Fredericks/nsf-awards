 "awd_abstract_narration": "A global economy alters the impact of changes in the environment.               The question addressed by this project is when the economy became               truly \"global.\"  The answer is to be found in the statistics of                 prices in different countries, which converge as the market                     becomes wider in extent.  Detailed studies of particular gaps in                prices--such as the 570 percent gap between the price of wheat in               Poland and in Northern Italy during the 15th century--test how                  much the convergence resulted from falls in transport costs and                 how much from institutional changes, such as peace, literacy, and               security of contract.  The statistical material is supplemented                 with linguistic and cultural information.  The methods employed                 are used in economics and geography, but have not been applied to               the longer-term history of the market.  The objective is to                     measure price convergence over many centuries, from ancient times               to the present, in order to give a standard for \"the\" market.                   Such a standard forms the background for scientific studies in                  economics, human ecology, geography, and history.                                                                                                               The connection between environment and the economy is not as                    simple as it looks from the biological perspective.  The economy                amplifies or dampens the impact of the physical environment.  To                project the complex of environmental and economic change into the               future is difficult at best, sensitive to errors of specification               in the mode: the best work of economists and meteorologists and                 ecologists agree that twenty years out we are guessing crudely.                 But we can know the past.  From documentation of forecasted areas               we can know how rapidly Icelandic topsoil has been eroded by                    cultivation int he millennium of settlement.  From new isotope                  techniques we can know the long and startlingly stable history of               carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  Global warming and chilling                  have happened before in recorded history, chronicles for example                in the growth rings of the bristlecone pine.  Contrary to recent                fears, global warming has on the whole been good for humans, and                in particular has expanded the market and the high culture that                 goes with the market.  The unusually warm decades or centuries                  around 1500 BC, the birth of Christ, and 1200 AD saw the market                 expand and civilization flourish.  The unusually cold decades or                centuries around 1000 BC, 700 AD, and 1350 AD were notorious                    setbacks to markets and culture.  The global market and the                     global ecology are connected, but in ways both benign and                       malignant, and in any case not easily predicted.",
