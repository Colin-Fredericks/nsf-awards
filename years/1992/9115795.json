 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Czechoslovakia research project between Dr. Carol                       A. Venanzi of the New Jersey Institute of Technology and                        Dr. Tibor Kozar of the Biophysics Institute of the                              Institute of Experimental Physics, Kosice, Czechoslovakia                       will study the solvent effects on the conformation of a                         set of artificial enzymes.  Each group will bring to this                       collaboration its own expertise.  The Slovak investigators                      will apply the random walk molecular mechanics method to                        the conformational analysis of the artificial enzymes in                        the gas phase.  Results will be used to evaluate the                            technique in terms of the U.S. investigators' distance                          geometry and molecular dynamics results.  Both groups will                      study the solvent effects on molecular conformation; the                        Slovak investigators will use the continuum solvent model                       in conjunction with the random walk technique while the                         U.S. investigators will use discrete solvent molecular                          dynamics simulations.  The project should yield a thorough                      evaluation of methods for searching for the conformational                      potential energy surface of a molecule.                                                                                                                         This project in biochemistry fulfills the program                               objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                      combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas                       of strong mutual interest and competence.",
