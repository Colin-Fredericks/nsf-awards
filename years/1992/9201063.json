Enrico Quarantelli and Joanne Nigg, University of                          Delaware, and Academician Konstantin Popov, Institute for                       System Studies, Moscow  will cooperate in a seminar on                          social science research on mitigation and recovery from                         disasters and large Scale Hazards in Moscow in June 1992.                       Ten American scientists will travel to Moscow to join the                       ten Russian scientists in discussing, comparing and                             evaluating existing knowledge and research findings  as                         developed by both groups with the idea of developing a                          research agenda for mutually beneficial future study                            collaboration.   The meeting will have the immediate                            effect of strengthening the disaster research tradition                         within the two countries which are already among the                            leaders in the area.  Indirectly, it should accelerate the                      development of an international network of disaster                             researchers which has started to come into being in the                         last decade.  American participants drawn from nine                             universities around the country will represent six                              different disciplines; the Soviet participants are from                         different research divisions in different parts of the                          country.                                                                                                                                                        Recent changes in the political climate allow a freer                           exchange of information about research results and the                          initiation of collaborative research projects which could                       contribute significantly to the development of social                           science knowledge about disasters and its application to                        the practical planning for and managing of hazardous                            occasions.                                                                                                                                                      This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the United States and Russia to combine complementary                           efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual                              interest and competence in the field of basic scientific                        research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and                             mutuality of benefit.",
