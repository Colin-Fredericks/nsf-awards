 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Schooley will study an enzyme, called JH-specific epoxide                   hydrolase (JHEH), thought to be important in regulating juvenile                hormone (JH) levels in insects. JH levels in insects are believed               to be controlled partly by the rate of hormone degradation. A dogma             has developed that the drop in JH level required for pupation of                insects including moths and butterflies is due mainly to the JH-                specific esterase. He has preliminary evidence that JHEH is at                  least as important as the esterase enzyme, if not more so. He will              characterize the enzyme in live insects and in insect extracts to               gain an understanding of its importance in controlling JH level.                He will do this by studying JH metabolism as a function of                      development and by studying the rate of metabolism of different                 kinds of JH. He will determine portions of the protein sequence of              the pure, isolated enzyme, and then isolate a molecular clone of                the gene encoding the enzyme in order to determine the complete                 sequence of the enzyme. He will also test how enzyme levels are                 controlled by studying the levels of messenger RNA coding for the               enzyme.",
