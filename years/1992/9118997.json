 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discovery of deep-sea fish in the stomachs of surface-feeding               seabirds foraging in open areas of pack ice has presented the                   surprising possibility of prey-predator coupling between two                    apparently disjunct communities.  Although many of the deep-sea                 species found in birds stomachs are known to migrate vertically                 on a daily basis, most have not been caught at depths of less                   than 100 m in open waters away from the ice, while the seabird                  species sampled are not known to forage deeper than 5 m.  This                  prey-predator coupling is intriguing but difficult to address                   with conventional methods because of the many problems associated               with sampling in pack ice.  As a first step in examining the                    interaction between the under-ice mesopelagic (100 to 1000 m) and               epipelagic (surface to 100 m) communities, scientists propose to                use moored, upward-looking hydroacoustic instruments to compare                 the distribution, abundance and movements of acoustically                       -detectable deep-sea fish in the epipelagic of the water column at              two stations in the Weddell Sea, one in the pack ice and one in the             ice-free area to the north.  Three null hypotheses will be                      addressed: 1) the vertical distribution of acoustically-detectable              fish in the epipelagic zone is the same in ice-free and ice-cover               regions; 2) the abundance of acoustically-detectable fish in the                epipelagic zone is the same in ice-covered and ice-free oceanic                 regions; and 3) the movements of acoustically-detectable fish in                the epipelagic zone are the same in ice-covered and ice-free                    oceanic regions.  This research constitutes a short-term                        feasibility study.  If hydroacoustic techniques prove successful,               scientists will then propose a more comprehensive, long-term                    study to quantitatively examine prey-predator links between                     deep-sea and sea-ice fish and bird communities.  Given the broad                extent of oceanic ice cover and the wide dispersal capabilities                 of the extensive seabird populations in polar seas, scientists                  expect such links to be important in the overall cycling of                     carbon in polar regions.",
