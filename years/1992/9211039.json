 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hazardous-waste minimization means the reduction of hazardous                   waste that is generated prior to its treatment, storage or                      disposal.  It represents an efficient method for preventing                     the release of hazardous substances to the environment.  An                     effective way of tackling waste-minimization problems is                        through the use of on-site recycle/reuse separation networks.                                                                                                   In addition to its favorable environmental impact, the                          adoption of this waste-recovery approach can provide an                         economically attractive waste-management alternative.  It can                   lead to significant energy and raw-materials savings and                        possibly provide income from the salable wastes.  With more                     than 250 million tons of hazardous wastes disposed of at the                    generating sites throughout the United States annually, the                     proposition of waste recycle/reuse is becoming a desirable                      industrial practice.                                                                                                                                            The objective of this project is to devise a new methodology                    for the optimal design of hybrid waste-recovery networks.                       This task involves the development of practical tools for the                   systematic integration and screening of the numerous potential                                                                                                  waste-separation systems as well as more classical ones such                    as distillation and mass exchange.  The problem will be                         formulated as an optimal-network synthesis task with the                        objective of minimizing the total annualized cost of the                        system while achieving all the assigned waste-reduction                         duties.  This formulation embeds all the potential process                      alternatives of interest and provides a tool for posing this                    design task as an optimization problem.  The solution of this                   problem identifies the optimal combination, arrangement,                        types, sizes and operating conditions of the separation                         processes to be employed for a given waste-recovery task.                       This approach will be elucidated via three representative                       cases:  the synthesis of pervaporation networks, reverse-                       osmosis systems, and reverse-osmosis-mass-exchange hybrid                       processes.",
