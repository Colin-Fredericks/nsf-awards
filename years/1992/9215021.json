 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key ingredient in technological innovation is the capability             of the available workforce.  The systems for educating and then                 professionally developing technical personnel vary among leading                industrialized countries.                                                            A systematic examination of these similarities and differences             can lead to a better understanding of how to make this vital                    process more effective.  Also the U.S. engineering community is                 currently experimenting with differing curricular approaches.                        This conference will bring together the experience from many               parts of the world and it is an ideal mechanism for a systematic                and timely examination of the education and professional                        development process in the U.S.                                                      The result of the conference is expected to be a better                    understanding of other approaches to this problem and this                      information will be able to be used to strengthen the U.S. system.",
