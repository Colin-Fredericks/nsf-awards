The                                       title of the symposium is:  Photo-Induced                                       Space Charge Effects in Semiconductors:                                         Photoconductivity, Spectroscopy and                                             Electro-Optics.  Travel and registration                                        funds for students and post-doctoral                                            attendees for this symposium is requested.                                      Of the submitted abstracts, at least two                                        from students and post-docs will be                                             elevated to the status of invited talks.                                        Travel and registrations for these two                                          speakers are requested.  In addition,                                           funds for partial support for 4 additional                                      students or post-docs are requested in                                          order to ensure that good speakers will                                         be able to attend who would not                                                 otherwise have the resources.  The                                              technical content of the symposium                                              centers around the photorefractive effect                                       and application to semiconductor                                                structures.                                                                                                                                                     The photorefractive effect is a space-                                          charge phenomena.  It operates through                                          the generation of photocarriers in a high-                                      resistivity sample, followed by                                                 photoconductive transport and trapping of                                       the charge at defects.  The                                                     photogenerated space-charge fields alter                                        the optical properties of the sample                                            through the electro-optic effect.  The                                          photorefractive effect is one of the most                                       attractive optical nonlinearity for                                             applications of all-optical control and                                         image processing because it requires very                                       low light intensities.  This low-light                                          requirement is a direct consequence of                                          the storage of space-charge on defects,                                         allowing low light intensities to be                                            integrated over time.  Applications                                             include phase conjugation, optical                                              amplification and spatial light modulators.                                                                                                                     Recent advances in the photorefractive                                          effect are using the electro-optic                                              properties of quantum-confined structures                                       \u0131Nolte, 1990!.  The role of the photo-                                          induced space-charge in these                                                   photorefractive quantum wells is closely                                        analogous to the feedback that occurs in                                        self electro-optic devices.",
