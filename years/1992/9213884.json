 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research will be conducted on high temperature                      superconductors (copper oxides).  This work is motivated by the                 close proximity, at low doping concentrations of oxygen, of the                 superconducting phase to the antiferromagnetic phase.  Our recently             developed semiclassical expansion of a model in this regime allows              for a controlled study of the slightly doped antiferromagnet.  The              comparison for these single hole results to numerical simulations               and experiments is encouraging.  The many hole problem has not been             studied and the proposed projects will clarify the effects of                   finite doping on the magnetic order and on the evolution from an                antiferromagnetic insulator to a high temperature superconductor.               %%%                                                                             This project will theoretically study one model for high                        temperature superconductors and its behavior before becoming                    superconducting.  Thus, the effect of oxygen doping on the magnetic             properties prior to becoming superconducting and the influence of               doping on superconductivity will be studied.  This problem is one               of the foremost ones in condensed matter physics and materials                  science.",
