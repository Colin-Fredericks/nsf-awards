The \"TIE\" project is a joint synergistic effort to study and               model the friction occurring with extremely small devices and                   loads.  The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center                     (I/UCRC) for Sensors and Actuators is studying friction in very                 small devices under extremely small loads.  The I/UCRC for                      Engineering Tribology is developing relevant solid mechanism models             that satisfy its collaboration's observations.  The Division of                 Mechanical & Structural Systems is cost-sharing this project.                        The Program Manager recommends Northwestern University be                  awarded $50,000 for a two-year \"TIE\" project to be performed                    collaboratively with the University of California, Berkeley.",
