 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past decade, the Division of Materials Development,                  Research, and Informal Science Education (DMDRI) at the National                Science Foundation (NSF) has funded more than 100 projects aimed                at developing materials to enhance both formal and informal                     teaching and learning across the nation in the fields of                        mathematics, science and technology.  While each of these                       projects has had a limited, project-specific evaluation                         component built into it, heretofore there has been little effort                to assess the longer-term impact of the projects either                         individually or as a class on teaching and learning on a broad                  scale across the nation.                                                                                                                                        To find the answers to key questions about the impact of                        DMDRI/NSF-sponsored activities, Reynolds and Schaeffer                          Associates, Inc. (R&S), proposes to use a highly interactive                    interdisciplinary team approach.  R&S will begin by working with                the DMDRI/NSF staff to select between 15 and 18 projects that                   are presently funded, or have been funded, by DMDRI/NSF within                  the past decade and have been judged to be successful according                 to the limited objectives of the individual project evaluations.                R&S will recruit and coordinate a team of people with                           significant expertise in the field who have successfully served                 in past projects, analyze the data and file individual reports                  for each project with the R&S PI.  The PI will analyze and                      synthesize the reports on the 15 to 18 individual projects into                 a single coherent report on the impact of DMDRI/NSF activities                  on formal and informal teaching and learning in the fields of                   mathematics, science and technology across the broad national                   spectrum.  This report will be filed with the Director,                         DMDRI/NSF not later than seven months from the project start                    date.",
