The bridge                                               is located in Franklin County, Ohio                                             and it will be loaded to                                                        destruction for structural                                                      identification by the Cincinnati                                                Infrastructure Institute.  This                                                 effort is being co-sponsored by the                                             Ohio Department of Transportation,                                              the Federal Highway Administration                                              and Franklin County, Ohio.

The bridge will be                                                 incrementally shaken-down to                                                    destruction by four servo-control                                               actuators reacting against rock-                                                anchors while simulating a                                                      stationary truck at mid-span in one                                             lane.  A linearized element-level                                               model of the bridge will be                                                     identified by impact, harmonic                                                  forced-excitation and truck-load                                                tests to reflect the existing                                                   state.  This will be the basis for                                              control design.  Extensive strain,                                              distortion, displacement and                                                    acceleration instrumentation will                                               be installed for nondestructive and                                             destructive testing; some of these                                              will be used for control feedback.                                              The active-mass driver system will                                              utilize three linear                                                            electromagnetic linear actuators.                                               Hardware will be used for signal                                                conditioning and processing and for                                             implementation of real time digital                                             control strategies.  The control                                                system designed for the existing                                                state will be tested as the bridge                                              is located to various limit states.                                             To test the control system the                                                  bridge will be excited by sudden                                                release of an initial displacement                                              (step relaxation) and by sinusoidal                                             and broadband input from a linear                                               servo-hydraulic exciter.",
