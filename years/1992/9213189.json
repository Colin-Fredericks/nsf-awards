 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic changes in the molecules that form the internal skeleton of             nerve cells are related to nerve cell form and function.                        Development of the nervous system requires that the neuronal                    cytoskeleton be endowed the seemingly incompatible properties of                morphological stability and plasticity.  Morphological stability is             critical for maintenance and proper function of neuronal circuits,              while plasticity is required for cell growth and remodeling of cell             processes during response to environmental stimuli or injury.  The              assembly or disassembly kinetics of microtubules will be studied                using the powerful techniques of microinjection, laser-induced                  photobleaching and photoactivation.  Previous studies using these               techniques have led to controversial results regarding the site of              assembly of microtubules in neuronal processes.  Novel experiments              will be performed to resolve this controversy and to evaluate the               potentially powerful photobleaching laser technology as applied to              living nerve cells.  This award will provide the PI with the laser              equipment necessary for these experiments.",
