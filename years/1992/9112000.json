 "awd_abstract_narration": "The factors that permit or, at the least, are correlated with              rapid speciation of a lineage when a founding member moves into a               new habitat are little understood.  Yet the phenomenon of adaptive              radiation is considered significant, and numerous cases have been               proposed over the years.  One basic issue at the start needs to be              established solidly, that is the phylogenetic relationships among               the species of the radiating assemblage.  A test case of precisely              this matter is under investigation with North American crayfish of              the genus Orconectes.  Approximately 24 species of the subgenus                 Procericambarus inhabit a variety of streams, pools, and river                  margins at high and low elevations in middle North America, and                 provide opportunities to study the pattern of adaptive speciation               into new ecological habitats.                                                        Faculty sponsor Alan Templeton and graduate student Keith                  Crandall are emphasizing molecular data from mitochondrial and                  nuclear DNA to establish a phylogeny of this group of animals.                  Special attention is being given to issues of assessing the                     statistical significance of these molecule-based phylogenetic                   reconstructions, and such statistical tests are likely to have                  general applicability to studies by other researchers.  With a                  robust phylogenetic estimate in hand, the investigators can then                explore such questions as: are habitat divergence and geographic                isolation among species independently associated through                        evolutionary time or do they interact with speciation events?  Does             a transition into a very different habitat type lead to much                    subsequent speciation (the well-known adaptive zone hypothesis of               the late paleontologist G. G. Simpson)?  Can speciation occur                   within an isolated drainage only if it is associated with habitat               divergence?  As well, the investigators will study aspects of                   morphological change including overall size reduction in these                  crayfish against the background of their molecularly based                      phylogeny.",
