 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rationale for this work is based on the fact that all                  photosynthetic organisms must adapt to changes in environment                   light intensity in order to maximize photosynthetic efficiency.                 At high light, excess energy has to be dissipated to prevent                    photodamage, while at low light, photon capture has be maximized                to allow photosynthesis to proceed efficiently.  We have been                   studying the photosynthetic prokaryote, Prochlorothrix                          hollandica, as a model system to examine the light/shade                        adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus.  This bacterium is                  well-suited to these studies because it is structurally similar                 to higher plant chloroplasts, but can be manipulated in the lab                 more easily that higher plants or eukaryotic algae.  Our work has               characterized the events occurring during light/shade adaptation                in both P. hollandica and plant chloroplasts, and we have shown                 that similar mechanisms occur in both systems.  Overall, we                     believe that analyzing this process in P. hollandica will reveal                in more detail the pathway required for plants to handle                        alterations in environmental light intensity.                                   %%%                                                                                                                                                                  Specifically, our work has shown that light/shade adaptation               involves in part the interplay of two separate events.  First,                  upon a shift to high light, the overall chlorophyll pigment                     system becomes reorganized in approximately 30 minutes; we                      calculate 40% of the accessory chlorophyll pigments are capable                 of changing their orientation such that energy capture and                      transfer is altered at high light.  This mechanism appears to be                controlled by a light-activated protein kinase.  Second, as cells               experience high light for several hours, a light-activated                      metalloprotease activity degrades a subset of the accessory                     chlorophyll-binding proteins.  The function of this protease is                 probably to limit the amount of photon capture at high                          irradiances.  Understanding precisely the mechanism(s) by which                 cells sense high light and trigger these responses will help us                 understand how photosynthesis is regulated in chloroplast (plant)               systems.  To date, we have cloned many of the genes encoding the                components involved in these mechanisms; these include the genes                encoding the protein kinase.  We are currently examining how                    light affects the expression of these genes, and how the function               of the kinase affects the function and organization of the                      photosynthetic light-harvesting antenna.  Lastly, we are                        examining in detail how the proteolytic activity acts to destroy                the accessory chlorophyll-proteins in high light; it is possible                that the accessory chlorophyll-proteins are targeted for                        proteolysis by their phosphorylation by the thylakoid protein                   kinase.",
