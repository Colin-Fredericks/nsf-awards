 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most striking political developments of the past                     century has been the expansion of government regulation and the                 consequent intrusion of \"civil\" enforcement agencies into most                  areas of social and economic life.  The past three decades in                   particular has witnessed a dramatic growth in the scope of                      authority and size of government agencies that focus coercive                   enforcement activities on normal citizens, rather than on                       criminals and criminal activities.  While studies of regulatory                 enforcement and administrative justice have also expanded                       rapidly, there is a considerable gap in our knowledge of civil                  enforcement and the behavior of non-policement enforcement                      agencies.  In particular, the critical question addressed in this               project is the extent to which the expanded coercive activities                 of enforcement agencies are controlled by democratic political                  institutions and principles.                                                                                                                                    This project analyzes the extent to which the coercive                          enforcement powers of federal agencies are controlled by elected                officials and democratic principles.  The project expands the                   conceptual framework to include the democratic principles of                    efficiency and equality, which may constrain even controls                      exerted by elected officials over enforcement actions against                   citizens.  The research team analyzes the responsiveness of                     Internal Revenue Service (IRS) enforcement activities to                        democratic controls.  This will be accomplished through                         interviews with Financial and Examination officials in the IRS                  and political leaders and knowledgeable observers in Washington,                New York and California.  The researchers will develop three                    state-level data bases consisting of:  IRS audit activities by                  audit class for 1960-1980; total individual and corporate audit                 activities for 1960-1990; and, IRS personnel for 1975-1990.  They               will use multiple indicators to probe the impact of presidential,               congressional, gubernatorial, and state legislative officials on                IRS audits and personnel.  They will clarify the concepts, develop              measures, and probe the impact of the democratic                                principles of efficiency and equality on IRS audits and                         personnel.  Finally, they will compare enforcement production                   functions for effectiveness of audits in improving tax compliance               over time, states, and audit classes.                                                                                                                           This research will provide an extensive analysis of IRS                         enforcement, focusing on the impact of political controls,                      democratic principles, organizationl constraints, and enforcement               effectiveness in explaining the variance of enforcement across                  tates and taxpayer categories for the last three decades.",
