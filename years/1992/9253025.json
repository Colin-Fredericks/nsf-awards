 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project outlines a plan to enhance the Environmental Science               Program at Alabama A&M University under the aegis of an                         interdisciplinary Center of Environmental Research and Training                 (CERT).  Emphasis will be given to research addressing several water            quality issues coupled with special emphasis on a mechanism                     proposed to increase entry of minority undergraduate students in                environmental science specializations.  In attempt to achieve these             goals, four objectives ar presented.  Objective 1 focuses on toxic              heavy metals interaction with mineral surfaces.  Mechanisms of toxic            metals interactions with soil and pure clay mineral surfaces                    (sorption/desorption/precipitation) as affected by inorganic anion will         be investigated in tandem.  Objective 2 deals with research on soil             property effects on volatile organic compound migration in the vadose           zone.  Here, the impact of selected soil properties on the migration of         two common volatile organic contaminants will be investigated.                  Objective 3 proposes research on soil physical, chemical and                    hydrologic properties effects on organic contaminant transport in the           vadose zone.  the downward movement of pesticide as influenced by               macropores will be evaluated using field data and modeling.  Finally,           objective 4 presents a method to facilitate the entry of minority               students in the environmental sciences.  Special emphasis is placed             on the entry of undergraduate students in environmental science.",
