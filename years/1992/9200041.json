As data associated with natural history collections are                increasingly used for research, conservation, resource                          management, and other purposes, there is a compelling need to                   explore the opportunities and constraints for data exchange.  The               funding of computerization and network projects suggests that                   there will be enormous growth of data sharing in the near future.               However, current patterns of data sharing, recent problems within               natural history collections and elsewhere in the scientific                     community, and expressed concerns all indicate that there are                   serious unresolved issues that limit willingness of institutions                to allow free access to collections data.                                            These issues will be addressed in the format of a workshop                 preceded by a series of introductory lectures, and followed by                  publication of guidelines by ASC.  Participants will come from                  the academic and museum communities, the conservation community                 and other users of collections-based data, database                             professionals, commercial interests, and experts in legal and                   ethical aspects of data exchange.  The workshop will be held at                 the AIBS meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 10-11, 1992.  In                addition to invited participants, there will be opportunities for               open participation.",
