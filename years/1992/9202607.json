 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project equips the new Economic Science Laboratory (ESL).                  The laboratory consists of 40 subject decision stations, which                  under this project, would be equipped with 32 model 386 personal                computers and 8 NeXT UNIX work stations plus support units and                  equipment.  In the last decade ESL has been instrumental in the                 development of software programs for the design of new \"Smart\"                  computer assisted auctions for network and other technologically                complex coordination markets.  The applications include natural                 gas pipeline networks, electric power networks, and combinatorial               resource packaging for airport slots, timber rights, scheduling                 problems, radio/TV spectra licenses, and many more.                                                                                                             The next generation of computer based experimental market designs               will require human decision makers at each station to be                        supported by expert systems for data analysis, optimization, and                strategic analysis.  Development and exploration planning and                   programming in this direction has already begun at ESL using two                workstations acquired on loans.  Computerized experimental                      projects include: private and common value auctions; oligopoly                  competition; markets for emission permits; financial market                     designs; individual decision making and markets; bargaining;                    neural models of adaptive behavior; public goods; marketing and                 laboratory experimentation.",
