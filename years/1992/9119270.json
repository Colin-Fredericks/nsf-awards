 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the population genetic structure of organisms                     distributed in discrete populations is essential to understanding               the subsequent evolution of such populations.  Most studies examine             the pattern of genetic variation within and among populations using             allozymes, neglecting sources such as chromosomal and morphological             variation.  These additional sources of variation are expected to               contrast with allozyme variation.  Random processes such as drift               should be important in the spread and/or fixation of chromosomal                variants since individuals heterozygous for chromosome arrangements             are often observed to have reduced fertility.  Selection acting on              morphological traits, however, can counteract such random                       processes.  Allozymes, assumed to be neutral genetic markers, will              be affected by random processes potentially important in fixation               of chromosomal variants.  Considering all three sources of                      variation together, chromosomal variation should coincide more                  closely with allozyme than with morphological variation.  The coPI              will examine the within and among population patterns of                        chromosomal variation in relation to both single gene (allozymes                and discrete morphological traits) and polygenic (quantitative                  genetic) variation in Clarkia dudleyana, a species known to contain             chromosomal polymorphism between populations.  The coPI will                    examine the chromosomal relationship, estimate gene frequencies of              both allozymes and morphological traits, and examine the pattern of             polygenic variation for eight natural populations.  The coPI will               also study selection to determine whether current selection regimes             are consistent with differences in the pattern of morphological                 variation as compared to allozyme and chromosomal variation.  The               general significance of the study is that it will improve our                   understanding of the survival and spread of natural plant                       populations.",
