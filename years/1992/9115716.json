 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine the sources of variability of light                     absorption by \"detrital\" particles on bio-optical properties in                 both eutrophic and oligotrophic waters.  In a number of bio-optical             studies \"detrital\" particulate material has been observed to cause              a pronounced increase in absorption from the blue into the near-                ultraviolet.  This study seeks to better define the nature of the               dominant blue- to uv-absorbing particulate chromophores in waters               with different optical characteristics, and to identify the types               of particle (detrital and living organisms) with which such                     chromophores are associated.  These objectives will be addressed in             combined laboratory and field investigations.                                                                                                                   The study will utilize analytical approaches which consider the                 question of detrital absorption at several levels: characterization             of individual particle types (by epifluorescence microscopy coupled             to an image analyzer); analyses of chromophore composition;                     measurements of particulate spectral absorption (total and                      \"partitioned\"); and, in the field, optical profiling.  Laboratory               studies will focus on the potential contribution of living                      organisms (particularly heterotrophic bacteria and protozoans) to               \"detrital\" absorption, the chromophore composition of biogenic                  detritus produced by microzooplankton, the relative importance of               different biological chromophore types, and the stability of                    chromophores in detrital particles.  Field work (within the South               Atlantic Bight) will extend the results of the laboratory study to              compare turbid inshore coastal waters with oligotrophic waters                  beyond the shelf break.  The role of geopolymers versus biogenic                chromophores in detrital absorption will be assessed. The results               of this study will be relevant to several disciplines, including                bio-optical oceanography and marine photochemistry.",
