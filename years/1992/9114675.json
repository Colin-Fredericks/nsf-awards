 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project between                               Dr. William L. Shelton of the University of                                     Oklahoma and Dr. Otomar Linhart of the Fisheries                                Research Institute, Vodnany, Czechoslovakia, will                               determine how gonadal differentiation of common                                 carp (Cyprinus carpio) and the European tench                                   (Tinca tinca) is affected by growth rate,                                       controlled by density dependency and temperature.                               The basic relationship determined in these                                      studies will be applied to protocol optimization                                of androgen-induced sex reversal.  Functionality                                of the phenotypic sex is emphasized as a                                        component of a breeding program to produce all-                                 female progeny for aquaculture.  U.S. and                                       Czechoslovakian scientists will collaborate on                                  this research, and conduct the investigation on                                 carp and tench in their own countries.  They will                               stock progeny of each species at various                                        densities in different habitats (ponds, tanks,                                  net enclosures) during year one, and examine the                                time/size-related chronology of gonadal                                         differentiation histologically.  In year two,                                   they will develop a temperature/size-time                                       relationship of gonadal differentiation.  During                                the third year, they will integrate the density-                                temperature mediated gonadal differentiation with                               efficacy testing of functional sex reversal with                                methyltestosterone.  This investigation merges                                  the dichotomy of a basic question and a pragmatic                               problem.                                                                                                                                                        This project in aquaculture and ecosystem                                       dynamics fulfills the program objective of                                      advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                                      leading experts in the United States and Eastern                                Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                                resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                                competence.",
