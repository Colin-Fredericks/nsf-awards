 "awd_abstract_narration": "The potential economic and safety benefits of improved                     short-term weather predictions are well known.  Due to the                      modernization of the national weather observing system,                         meteorologist will have access to data of much better spatial and               temporal resolution than previously possible on a day to day                    basis.  This improvement in the operational weather system                      provides opportunities for enhanced research in the area of                     mesoscale meteorology.  Mesoscale meteorological processes                      generally control the timing, location and severity of most life                threatening and economically disruptive weather such as flash                   floods, heavy snowfalls, tornadoes, etc.  The opportunities for                 fundamental improvements in short term forecasts (up to two days)               has caused several agencies within the US government to plan a                  major interagency research program known as the US Weather                      Research Program (USWRP).                                                            The USWRP consists of several components including a series                of intensive field observational studies.  The first of these,                  know as the Stormscale Operational and Research                                 Meteorology-Fronts Experiment, Systems Test (STORM-FEST), has                   three closely related objectives: focussed investigation of the                 structure and evolution of wintertime fronts and associated                     mesoscale phenomena with emphasis on precipitation and severe                   wintertime weather (e.g. severe icing conditions); a research                   assessment of the new operational and research meteorological                   instrumentation facilities and composite observational networks;                a study to begin to understand mesoscale prediction capabilities                and limitations in active frontal regions.                                           The Principal Investigator will use a wide variety of                      research and operational data, including data from the next                     generation of operational instruments, to study frontal mesoscale               structures.  The data will come from the STORM-FEST and a                       previously completed experiment which studied east coast winter                 storms, know as the Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment (GALE).                 The principal objectives of the research are to: document the                   structure of precipitation in winter cyclones; to determine the                 mechanisms responsible for the organization of significant                      mesoscale precipitation phenomena; to improve the forecasting of                heavy precipitation in winter cyclones.",
