 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to pursue two lines of research on which he           has done some work.  The first line of research is to investigate the           conditions under which the incentive effects of private information are         ameliorated by large numbers of economic agents and when markets may            perform well in these circumstances.  The second line of research is to         develop and analyze methods in which there is an interrelationship              between economic decisions and social aspects of an environment.  In            such models we may expect rational economic agents to care about their          relative position in society.  This concern may result in qualitatively         different predictions from those generated from models ignoring these           social aspects of the environment.  This project is important because           it would improve our understanding concerning how differing conventions         for making non-market decisions interact with market decisions.",
