 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses research in the design and analysis of  algorithms, motivated by applications in many other areas of computer  science.  Very similar problems tend to arise in very different  applications.  As an example, the ``least weight subsequence problem''  which is studied in connection with certain biological sequence  comparison problems has also appeared in page layout algorithms, VLSI  design theory, and computational geometry.  Also work in motion  planning for parts handlers may be couched in the language of automata  theory, and is closely related to some problems in coding theory.  As  a consequence, theoretical computer science research might be most  appropriately grouped by solution style and technique, rather than by  the problems that it solves.  Along with traditional sequential  algorithms, there is work with parallel (PRAM model) algorithms.  Algorithms in molecular biology have become increasingly important, as  the quantity of DNA sequence information known has been growing  more quickly than the ability of computers to process it.  Until  recently, most workers in biological algorithms were mathematicians  and biologists.  Their research identified and formalized many  problems in this area, but the algorithms they developed tended to be  simple applications of dynamic programming.  This work  applies more sophisticated techniques to these problems, resulting in  speedups of one or two orders of magnitude.  There will also be ongoing research on problems of computing minimum  spanning trees, both for graphs and for planar point sets.  The main  focus is on dynamic versions of such problems as the minimum  spanning tree.  This has led to a more general study of off-line  algorithms, and to data structures for querying the effects on  the MST on potential future update.",
