 "awd_abstract_narration": "This activity aims at a systemic examination of the                             educational, technological and financial terrain that                           extends beyond the present very modest frontier of                              educational telecommunication activities by schools to over-                    the-horizon network applications.  It aims at affecting NREN                    planning and experimentation, which should, in turn, produce                    data on costs, educational benefits and demand that can                         affect public and private sector investment decisions.  It                      aims too at developing an initial consensus among educators                     on the role of wideband network applications that goes                          beyond the technologically and educationally modest                             experimentation presently visible.                                                                                                                              Project outcomes include three documents.  The principal                        document of some 50 to 60 pages includes a suite of                             experimental designs and a summary assessment of their                          educational potential by educational policy and decision                        makers.  Three designs, more and less educationally radical,                    technologically advanced and financially expensive are aimed                    at improving science and mathematics education; and                             structuring new options for school reform.  A shorter                           secondary document describes educational needs for group                        software products, information services and educational                         databases.  A final document describes some options for                         allocating costs and for financing educational use of local                     and wide-area network applications.                                                                                                                             Dissemination is planned in both print and conference                           formats.",
