 "awd_abstract_narration": "Results from present studies of boundary scavenging in the Pacific              ocean suggest that as much as 70% of dissolved particle-reactive                chemical species, like 10Be, may be removed from the ocean in margin            environments.  This prediction, however, is based on only a few                 studies of margin environments in the eastern Pacific and presumes              that enhanced deposition of particle-reactive chemical species                  occurs in all ocean-margin environments.  In a contemporary study               in the western North Atlantic no evidence has been found for                    enhanced deposition of the radioactive tracers that are commonly                used to evaluate boundary scavenging.  A better understanding of                the factors that lead to very different removal efficiencies at                 different margins is required before the ocean-wide transport and               fate of particle-reactive chemical species can be modeled and                   protected.                                                                                                                                                      This research will test two hypotheses to explain the absence of                boundary scavenging off the east coast of the U.S., one of which is             related to the presence of strong western boundary currents off the             east coast, and the other related to export of fine-grained                     particulate manganese.  A multi-pronged approach to test these                  hypotheses will be employed.   Specific tasks include;                          1) tests for boundary scavenging of 10Be in the Middle Atlantic                 Bight,                                                                          2) an examination of samples of fine-grained particulate matter                 collected by large volume in situ filtration to assess the                      enrichment of radiotracer concentrations in Mn-rich particulate                 phases being transported away from the margin, and                              3) a study of boundary scavenging at an eastern North Atlantic                  margin to complement recent studies off the east and west coasts of             the U.S.",
