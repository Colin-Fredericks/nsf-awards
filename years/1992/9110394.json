 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diel vertical migration (DVM) is the daily up and down                     movement of diverse populations in both freshwater lakes and                    oceans.  These long migrations cause daily, local fluctuations in               zooplankton density, therefore directly affecting grazing rates                 on phytoplankton and energy transfer to fish populations.  Field                research and numerical simulations have identified both the                     ecological conditions under which zooplankton production can be                 maximized, along with the constraints on survival, growth and                   reproduction imposed on alternative DVM behaviors.  Accordingly,                it appears that variation in DVM, observed in the field, is                     adaptive.  However, mechanisms causing such variation in DVM are                unknown, largely because little is known about the importance of                genetic variation relative to environmental change.                                  The objectives of this study are:  (1) to determine whether                genetically different individuals in a population have different                DVM distributions in the field (2) the laboratory,                              determine whether genetically different individuals respond in                  the same way to experimental environments designed to simulate                  field conditions, and whether those responses are similar in                    different environments.  The study objectives will provide an                   understanding of the causes of variability in stratification                    behavior of the zooplankter Daphnia galeata mendotae.  Since                    stratification behavior largely determines habitat range, this                  study offers insight into not only mechanisms of DVM but also                   data on basic zooplankton ecology, determinants of habitat                      choice, along with maintenance of polymorphisms.  Finally,                      understanding mechanisms of zooplankton DVM means a better                      understanding of behaviors influencing food availability for fish               and grazing rates on phytoplankton.",
