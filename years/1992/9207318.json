 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal scope of the proposed work is to show  that weakly                coupled, flexible, cyclic assemblies with geometric                             nonlinearities due to finite-amplitude motions, possess localized               nonlinear modes, i.e., free oscillations during which the motion                is mainly confined to only one of their subsystems. This will be                achieved by using a multiple-scales averaging methodology and                   studying the corresponding amplitude and phase modulation                       equations. The effects of internal resonances between flexible                  modes on the mode localization will be analytically investigated                and the force responses of the system due to external harmonic                  loads will be considered. It will be shown that weakly coupled                  cyclic assemblies possess fundamental, subharmonic and                          superharmonic localized resonances, during which only a limited                 number of their subsystems resonate. Motion confinement of                      externally generated disturbances due to nonlinear mode                         localization will then be investigated by numerical computations,               involving finite element and Gallerkin methodologies. The                       principal aim of this study is to show that the inherent dynamics               of certain weakly coupled, nonlinear cyclic systems, lead to                    motion confinement of externally induced disturbances. The                      controllability of such systems  is then greatly improved, since                in designing for passive or active vibration isolation, one needs               only consider the dynamics of a limited number of their                         substructure instead of considering the response of the whole                   cyclic assembly.*** //",
