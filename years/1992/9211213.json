 "awd_abstract_narration": "The steroidogenic enzymes involved in androgen biosynthesis are                 present and functional in the Leydig cells of rat testes throughout             all stages of sexual maturation.  However, the type of testicular               androgens secreted changes significantly with age.  Sexual                      maturation marks the shift from testicular secretion of 5a-reduced              androgens to testosterone, the principal androgen that is secreted              in the adult.  Although the biosynthetic pathway from progesterone              to testosterone has been well established, the maturational change              in testosterone accumulation is not fully understood.  The activity             of steroid 5a-reductase, an enzyme that converts 3-oxo-4-ene                    steroids to 5a-reduced metabolites, plays a key role in determining             the final steroid products secreted by the testis.  The steroid                 products secreted may have widely differing peripheral and                      testicular biological actions.  In the proposed research, a                     polyclonal antibody to rat liver 5a-reductase will be make and used             to localize the protein in the testis by immunofluorescence.  The               levels of steroid 5a-reductase protein and mRNA in the testis will              be determined throughout puberty in the rat.  Results of these                  studies will provide a basis for studying the regulation of this                enzyme and the mechanisms involved in qualitative changes in                    steroid biosynthesis.",
