 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed investigation examines energy and momentum flow                 across the magnetopause using in-situ observations of magnetic                  field and plasmas obtained by the ISEE 1 and 2 spacecraft and                   ground based data from the IGS magnetometer chain.  The average                 potential drop across the magnetosphere when the interplanetary                 magnetic field is southward will be measured using both the                     magnetic field normal to the magnetopause surface and the flow                  velocity along the surface.  By repeated individual measurements                across the surface, both the region of reconnected field and the                total potential drop can be estimated.  In order to determine the               normal component an accurate model of the 3-D shape of the                      magnetopause will be derived.  The pressure dependence of this                  model will allow us to test if pressure pulses can cause crater                 FTE's as has been suggested.                                                      When the IMF is northward and reconnection is weak, energy                    transfer can still take place by wave processes.  We will examine               the waves present from Pc 3 to Pc 5 periods to determine if                     significant wave energy flux crosses the boundary.  We will examine             simultaneous ground based data from the IGS magnetometer chain at               2.5s resolution to determine how this wave energy spreads through               the magnetosphere.  We will also examine the response of auroral                and subauroral zone current systems to dynamic pressure changes.                Finally, we will examine each of the boundary layers inside and                 outside the magnetosphere to determine how each of them depends on              solar wind conditions and position on the magnetopause in order to              determine what processes are responsible for these boundary layers.             In particular we will examine their formation as a function of                  solar wind conditions.",
