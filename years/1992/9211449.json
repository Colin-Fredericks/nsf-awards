San Diego.  Biochemical reactions create form and function                 according to the instructions found in the cells.  In the last two              decades, there have been exciting developments in our knowledge of              how genetic instructions are read in plants.  However, the                      information about metabolic pathways and the regulation of these                pathways has increased only marginally.  In addition, younger                   generations of plant biologists have fewer and fewer opportunities              to learn about what is known about plant biochemistry due to the                decreasing number of investigators interested in the subject.  This             summer course is designed to focus attention of the plant biology               community on the biochemical problems of form and function of plant             cells that could profitably be addressed using the tools developed              during recent years.  Twenty lecturers, all experts on specific                 aspects of plant biochemistry, are selected to give lectures and                lead discussion sessions on key topics in plant biochemistry.  The              target audience is advanced graduate students, postdoctoral                     function according tot he instructions found in the cells.

After the course is completed, the lecture                 notes will be made available widely to the general scientific                   community as an aide to teach plant biochemistry.  The course is                supported jointly with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the               Department of Energy.",
