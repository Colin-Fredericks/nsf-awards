The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit              by Dr. David Weiss of Stanford University to work with Professor                Serge Haroche at L'Ecole Normale Superieure.                                                                                                                    This project is in the field of Quantum Optics, specifically in                 Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics.  An apparatus is currently under                construction at L'Ecole Normale Superieure which will enable the                field in a high finesse microwave cavity to be measured using                   beams of atoms in a long-lived Rydberg states.  The cavity is                   detuned from an atomic resonance so that while the atoms                        experience a measurable energy shift due to light in the cavity, they           do not absorb any of the cavity's photons.  This so-called quantum              non-demolition scheme is the first that promises to allow                       measurements of extremely weak fields, down to the single photon                level.  The likely first experiments using this system will be the              preparation of non-classical states of the field, including pure                number states, where the exact number of photons is determined at               the expense of all knowledge of the field's phase, and \"Schrodinger             cat\" states, which are coherent superpositions of different classical           fields.                                                                                                                                                         The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a stipend for twelve months.",
