 "awd_abstract_narration": "Police in the United States and other developed democracies are in              a period of unprecendented rethinking of their basic purposes and               operational procedures.  The internationalization of policing is                a major current phenomenon, as a consequence of the growth of                   international crime problems and such developments as European                  integration.  Despite the fact that there is a general perception               among police professionals and observers that this is a watershed               period in policing, surprisingly little is known about patterns of              resource allocation, organization, and strategy.  This is not only              true on a comparative international basis, but for individual                   countries as well.                                                                                                                                              This grant will provide support for the completion of a comparative             international project on police operations in five developed                    democracies.  Specifically, Professor Bayley will compile data from             Great Britain, following the research design already followed in                Japan, Australia, Canada, and the United States; organize and                   analyze the data from the five countries; and write a book-length               manuscript on policing in developed countries.  Longitudinal and                cross-sectional data will be collected on police resources,                     personnel, dispositions, demands, workloads, and strategic plans                in three British forces as well as national data from the Home                  Office.  As in the other four countries, information will be                    collected about trends in allocations for the past twenty years and             about variations in allocations among different social settings                 contemporaneously within each force.  In addition, interviews will              be conducted with key operational and managerial personnel.                                                                                                     This project will produce the most extensive collection to date of              information about the character of contemporary police operations               on a comparative basis.  It will increase our understanding of the              ways that differences in environment and organization of policing               affect the work police do.  As such, the study has practical                    relevance to public policies about police organization and service              delivery.  Also, the study will provide important theoretical                   insights into the linkage between policing functions and the                    organizational, administrative, and cultural milieu of police                   organizations.  Finally, it will provide a basis for examining                  other issues in law enforcement such as morals, attritions, police              values and attitudes, and the police subculture.  Understanding                 these issues will contribute to basic knowledge about individual                rights and collective responsibilites as well as the proper                     relationship between government and the governed.",
