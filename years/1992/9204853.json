 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Networked Resource Discovery Project of Colorado has                   investigated a number of issues concerned with allowing users of                the Internet to discover resources of interest in large                         administratively decentralized environments, including resources                such as documents, network services, and people.  Implicit in these             projects is the assumption that the Internet will continue to grow              and evolve as a medium for supporting wide area distributed                     applications.  In response to a number of well publicized problems              many sites have installed mechanisms to limit their exposure to                 security intrusions.  While these measures are preferable to the                damage that could occur from security violations, taken to extremes             they could limit the capability of the Internet.  To understand the             evolution of this situation, the researchers propose to carry out               a longitudinal measurement study of changes in service-level                    reachability in the global TCP/IP Internet.  The data they gather               will uncover changes in how sites resolve the problem of supporting             open network usage while ensuring reasonable security.",
