 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a small invitational planning workshop on Scientific                    Collaboration and Interaction with Remote, Unique Facilities held               on the campus of the University of Michigan on January 21-24,                   1992.  A major function of the workshop is to bring together                    members of the scientific research community who are engaged in                 collaborative experimental research using a unique, remote                      facility, with technologists and social scientists working on                   collaborative technology.   The researches are engaged in upper                 atmospheric and space research utilizing the Sondre Stromfjord,                 Greenland Upper Atmospheric  Research Facility.  The goal of the                workshop is to develop a plan to implement and testbed                          collaborative tools to be utilized by scientists engaged in                     collaborative and observational research using this facility.                   Included in these plans are design of a system for accessing the                instruments at this facility from remote locations, such as at                  the University of Michigan.   It is expected that the output of                 this workshop will be a proposal for establishing the                           experimental testbed for this collaborative effort.",
