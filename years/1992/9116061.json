 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inability to identify marine invertebrate larvae to the                     species level is a common stumbling block to many field studies                 of larval ecology.  Larvae within taxonomic groups such as                      barnacles, bivalves, and starfish are often so morphologically                  similar between species that no identification to the species                   level is possible based on appearance.  Though research is                      underway on several novel techniques for identification of                      larvae, none has solved the problem as yet.  In contrast,                       identification of larvae using mitochondrial DNA is a method that               exists right now, and with a little development can be used for                 screening large numbers of larvae.                                                                                                                              Drs. Olson & Kocher have already used mtDNA technology for                      identifying sea cucumber larvae. Now they will, 1) develop                      methods for screening large numbers of larvae using genetic                     probes, 2) establish a mtDNA sequence database for deep sea                     echinoderm species, and 3) utilize the techniques to answer                     questions about the vertical location of deep sea echinoderm                    larvae.  They will work on echinoderms because they are a phylum                for which there exists substantial mtDNA sequence data already                  and the universal PCR primers are known to work well for them.                  However, the methods developed will be applicable to all marine                 invertebrate larvae.",
