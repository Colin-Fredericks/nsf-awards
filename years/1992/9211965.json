 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to determine how ecological                     factors shape facultative mutualisms, focussing on ant-plant                    system.  The proposed studies of the relationship between the                   plants and their ant occupants, of the life history characters of                                                                                               the ant species that occupy the plants, and of ecological                       interactions between ant species will contribute to our                         understanding of how facultative ant-plant mutualisms are                       established and maintained.  Ecological investigations such as                  those outlined in this proposal can identify likely selective                   environments in which future evolutionary specialization may take                                                                                               place.  Comparative research of the interaction between the                     ant-plant Conostegia setosa (Melastomataceae) and its ant                       occupants at two rainforest sites, one in Costa Rica and one in                 Panama is being conducted.  Since each species of ant occupant                  potentially has a different effect on plant fitness, the identity                                                                                               and frequency of each species of ant occupant and how the                       identity of the occupants is determined are important in                        predicting the likelihood of the evolution of more specialized                  mutualisms.  Experiments are designed to address several                        ecological factors that may determine the occupants of C. setosa:                                                                                               by: 1) observing interactions between the species of ant                        occupants and other area ant species at baits, 2) comparing life                                                                                                history variables such as colony structure, foraging strategies,                                                                                                and competitive behaviors that may affect establishment in C.                   setosa plants by the different species of ant occupants, and 3)                 measuring the benefits of the interaction to the plants and the                 ants.  A long-term transplant experiment has been set up to                     investigate modes of colonization by each ant species, priority                 effects, and the influence of the ant community on the identity                 of the ant occupants.",
