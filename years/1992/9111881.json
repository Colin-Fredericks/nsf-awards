 "awd_abstract_narration": "The leaf beetle Ophraella notolata and Ophraella sp. nov.                (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) that specialize on the asteraceous                  plants Iva frutescens and Ambrosia artemisiifolia respectively,                 offer a unique opportunity to examine the relative contribution                 of the many factors that may act to restrict insect host ranges.                Results to date suggest that the species feeding on the derived                 host plant (O. notulata) retains a greater ability (in terms of                 behavior and physiology) to utilize the ancestral host than the                 species (O. sp. nov.) feeding on the derived host.  Further,                    there exists significant genetic variation in both species for                  the ability to utilize the host of its congener.                                       These results will be expanded and complemented with a                   series of field experiments in Florida, where the two congeners                 overlap, to examine the ecological selective pressures that may                 be operating to restrict host range.  The main objectives will be               to: 1) test for tradeoffs in larval performance between hosts in                the field, 2) examine effects of competition between the two                    Ophraella species and between each Ophraella species and other                  phytophages of their host plants, 3) scrutinize the effects of                  generalist predators and parasitoids, and 4) investigate the                    behavioral and physiological responses of Ophraella to host plant               secondary compounds.  It is expected that this effort will yield                valuable information about how various intrinsic and extrinsic                  ecological factors (aspects of plant chemistry, competition,                    predation, and behavior/physiology) affect host plant                           utilization.  Such knowledge should prove valuable in enhancing                 our understanding of the processes responsible for shaping                      patterns of insect host use.",
