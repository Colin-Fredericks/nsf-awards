 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in              astrophysics between the NSF Science and Technology Center (STC)                for Particle Astrophysics at the University of California, Berkeley,            and the Theoretical and High Energy Physics Laboratory of the                   University of Paris, South.  The U.S. and French research teams                 will be led by Bernard Sadoulet, Director of the STC at Berkeley,               and Jean Kaplan, director of the French research group.                         Specifically, support will be provided to advanced U.S. graduate                students and young postdoctoral researchers affiliated with the                 Berkeley STC for travel to France.  The objectives are to provide               these young investigators with research experience at a French                  center of scientific excellence and to establish long-lasting links             between the research programs in the U.S. and France, thereby,                  enhancing the scientific productivity of both groups.                                                                                                           The U.S. and French teams will focus on the fundamental problem                 of dark matter, a topic identified as the highest priority in                   astrophysics research.  Evidence indicates that 90% or more of the              universe is made of dark matter, and that this matter may be in the             form of particles dating back to the beginning of the universe.  The            study of the dark matter problem has important implications for                 understanding the origin of the universe and the fundamental                    nature of matter.  The U.S. and French teams will focus their                   efforts on:  (1) experimental searches for dark matter either in the            form of weakly interactive particles or in the form of massive                  astrophysical compact halo objects;  (2) theoretical investigations of          various dark matter particle candidates and their signatures in the             atrophysical environment; and (3) development of a theory of                    galaxy formation and clustering in the universe, in which dark                  matter may play a central role.",
