 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to expand and improve the existing                   curriculum and teaching capabilities in computer-assisted                       cartography, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote                    sensing in the Department of Geography,  University of Idaho.                   The new laboratory equipment includes PC workstations, data                     input and output devices (digitizers and plotters) and a local                  area network to provide transfer capability of files from IBM                   compatible workstations to Macintosh workstations as well as                    with the campus-wide electronic network.  This will provide a                   versatile laboratory for undergraduate instruction in computer                  assisted geographic information technologies.  A series of lab                  sessions based on the proposed equipment has been designed that                 will address a missing component of the curriculum, learning                    and mastering tools and skills to address theoretical problems                  and applied techniques needed in the present computer-aided job                 market.  The laboratory improvement is part of a larger                         development program for the College of Mines and Earth                          Resources.",
