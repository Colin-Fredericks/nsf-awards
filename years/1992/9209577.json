 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently there has been a great deal of work on formal models of                machine learning such as the probably approximately correct (or                 PAC learning model.  This model is a precise framework attempting               to capture the notion of learning from examples.  Recent progress               in machine learning and statistical inference on paradigms such as              the PAC model has provided fundamental results on the amount of                 data needed for function approximation in a completely                          nonparametric setting.  The applicability of these paradigms is                 limited by the assumptions on the data gathering mechanisms and the             performance criteria.  Some of these assumptions will be relaxed                to allow the extended learning paradigm to be applied to areas such             as signal/image processing and geometric reconstruction.  The                   approach is to place mild assumptions on the function classes while             allowing more flexibility in the sampling and error criteria.                   Specifically, the extensions proposed are to allow deterministic                sampling strategies, sampling over noncompact domains, and learning             with respect to general performance criterion.  The extended model              will be applied to a variety of problems in signal processing and               geometric reconstruction to provide information complexity results              for some classical and new reconstruction/estimation problems.  In              the area of signal processing, the framework will be applied to                 problems dealing with tomographic image reconstruction,                         multiresolution signal processing, and classical sampling theorems.             In the area of geometric reconstruction, applications to stochastic             geometry and shape form probing problems.  The approach will                    provide results on the fundamental capabilities and limitations of              reconstruction as well as sample size bounds for these                          applications.",
