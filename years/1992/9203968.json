 "awd_abstract_narration": "In rapid and continuous manufacturing situations such as                   filament winding and pultrusion, the goal is to obtain a high                   volume fraction of the fibers with uniform resin impregnation and               a structure that is well bonded and free from voids and residual                stresses.  Hence, the mechanics of resin impregnation under non-                isothermal conditions, the mass diffusion of the polymer across the             interfaces of impregnated fiber bundles and the changing                        crystallinity as the structure solidifies are key phenomena during              the processing of such composite materials.  This research will                 develop a systematic understanding of the mechanisms of transport               of mass, momentum and energy in a continuously deforming                        anisotropic porous media of aligned fibers and examine their                    interactions and estimate their relative importance.  This can then             be integrated into process models which will allow calculation of               the fiber volume fraction, void fraction and residual stresses as               a function of the manufacturing process, material form and                      processing conditions.  The approach will involve model                         experimental studies in carefully controlled laboratory conditions,             which will serve to identify and understand the physics of flow of              shear thinning viscous fluids and will form the basis for                       theoretical modeling.  Simultaneously, the role of transport                    equations at the microscopic level in a cell geometry                           representative of the anisotropic medium will be explored.  The                 intent being to develop a macroscopic process model based on                    microscopic analysis that will relate the fiber volume fraction,                void content and residual stress distribution of different material             forms and processing conditions.  To establish the validity and                 usefulness of the formulated process models, experiments in actual              processing environment encompassing of filament winding and                     pultrusion processing techniques will  be carried out.                               The study will allow the production of more uniform, high                  strength components from composite materials.",
