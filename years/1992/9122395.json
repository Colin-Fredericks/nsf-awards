 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wixted's research is designed to enhance our understanding of               the principles that govern animal memory.  If successful, the                   results may help to solve the far more complex puzzle of how                    memory operates, and sometimes goes awry, in humans.  The basic                 procedure used throughout these experiments involves presenting a               series of trials, during each of which a color (e.g., red) is                   shown to a pigeon in a center window for a few seconds, the color               is removed for a period of time, and then the pigeon is given a                 choice between two colors (red vs. green) in two side windows.  A               response to the matching color (in this case, red) is rewarded                  with food while a response to the nonmatching color simply ends                 the trial.                                                                                                                                                      Dr. Wixted will carry out three sets of experiments that address                different, but related, issues.  The first set is concerned with                the question of how short-term and long-term memory compete to                  determine the pigeon's choice on a given trial.  More                           specifically, the choice between red and green may involve a                    competition between short-term memory for the previous color                    (red) and long-term memory for the choice color that generally                  provides the greater number of rewards.  The second set of                      experiments is concerned with identifying the psychological                     variables that cause a stimulus to become more (or less)                        memorable.  The principle under investigation holds that a                      stimulus associated with a short delay to a biologically                        significant event (e.g., food) is more memorable than one                       associated with a long delay.  Finally, the third set of                        experiments investigates the variables that influence memory for                nonoccurrence.  That is, under what conditions will an animal                   remember that no stimulus appeared in the center window on a                    particular trial?  Together, the results of these experiments                   will help to identify the principles that underlie animal and,                  ultimately perhaps, human memory.",
