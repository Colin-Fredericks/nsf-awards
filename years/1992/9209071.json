 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of stream fish ecology emphasize the long-standing                 view that local factors determine local diversity.  However, a                  growing body of evidence form studies of other groups of organisms              suggests that local diversity is strongly influenced by diversity               at broader spatial and temporal scales.  The local determinism                  hypothesis predicts that local communities are in equilibrium with              the local environment, and thus, are only as complex as local                   habitat. The regional enrichment hypothesis predicts increases in               local diversity with increases in regional diversity, regardless                of                                                                              habitat complexity, and local adjustments in niche breath and niche             overlap to accommodate the added diversity.  A three-year study of              local and regional influences on stream fish diversity in the                   southeastern U.S. is proposed to test predictions of the above                  hypotheses.  Fishes will by sampled, and data on habitat                        variability gathered, from small, upland streams in five                        southeastern drainage basins differing in diversity.  The effects               of differences in basin-scale diversity on local species-abundance              relationships and habitat utilization patterns will be analyzed to              determine how basin level diversity is accommodated locally.  The               goal of this research is demonstrate the degree to which diversity              in small local areas depends on processes operating outside of the              areas.  The results should have special relevance for biological                conservation efforts.",
