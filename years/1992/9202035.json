 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several classes of biological and synthetic lipids from                         hydrated membrane systems that display a variety of lamellar                    and nonlamellar phases as a function of temperature, pressure                   and concentration.  This proposal focuses on inverted cubic                     phases which are found between lamellar and hexagonal phases.                   The inverted cubic phases of interest are those which are                       bicontinuous with respect to the polar (aqueous) and nonpolar                   (lipid) phases.  The interpenetrating network of aqueous                        channels and lipid surfaces of the bicontinous cubic phase                      permit the passage of water soluble species through the                         structure.  These free standing structures have the morphology                  of zeolite only with biocompatible lipid surfaces, and as such                  can be envisioned to have many applications in bioseparations                   and membrane reactor techniques.                                                                                                                                Once formed, cubic lipid phases are sometimes stable for                        weeks, however their temperature range is usually narrow and                    frequently occurs at temperatures higher than room or even                      physiological temperatures.  The PI has pioneered the                           technique of stabilizing lipid bilayers and vesicles by                         attaching polymerizable reactive groups, particularly                           diacetylenic groups, to the constituent lipids, and then                        initiating a polymerization after the supramolecular assembly                   has formed.  The aim of the proposed research is to apply this                  technique to the stabilization of cubic structures.  In                         particular, the proposed research will design and synthesize                    polymerizable lipids which are expected to display a                            bicontinuous cubic phase characterize the polymerized and                       unpolymerized phases by differential scanning calorimetry, X-                   ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy.",
