 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Center is a \"hands-on\" science museum with a                      mission to provide the public with a basic science literacy.                    The proposed HOFPP project is an outreach program that will take                an informal science education activity to disadvantaged parents                 and children in the facilities of four (first year)                             collaborating \"parents\":  The Urban League, the Spanish Action                  League, the North American Indian Club and Girls Inc. of Central                NY.  The purpose of the program is to encourage and enable                      parents of disadvantaged school children to play an active role                 in their child child's education.  Phase I of the program is                    implemented as a series of ten weekly classes in which parents                  and children will work together on hands-on science activities;                 Phase 2 follows with a science club program.  Graduates will be                 informally channeled into an inner-city magnet school for                       science and math.  Past Discovery Center outreach programs have                 already demonstrated ability to attract disadvantaged parents.                  The proposed program will touch 1,000 disadvantaged persons                     during the initial three-year period.  During the third year the                HOFPP project will be transported and implemented at a Science                  museum in another New York State community.                                                                                                                     A three year cost-shared NSF project is proposed that will be                   later sustained by The Discovery Center operating budget with                   local donations.  A professional outside evaluation will be                     performed to measure program success.  Program reports,                         materials and consultation will be propagated to other                          interested organizations to gain maximum impact.",
