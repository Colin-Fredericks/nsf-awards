 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key characteristic of the spatial choice and behavior                    literature is that many of the most frequently investigated                     behaviors involve choices among a discrete set of stimuli.                      Frequently studied discrete choices include mode choice,                        residential choice, destination choice, industrial site choice,                 land use policy choice, and retail choice.  Psychophysics and                   cognitive science research finds that perception is                             probabalistic; even at the individual level there is a random                   effect in how individuals perceive stimuli.  This research                      project will develop and evaluate a model that acknowledges the                 probabalistic nature of the spatial preference and choice process               by portraying stimuli as having differential amounts of                         variation.  The proposed model has estimation properties that                   allow it to be directly used as a decision-making aid in ways                   that previous models cannot.  By explicitly modeling uncertainty                and ambiguity, the model will allow for the unique estimation of                a single ideal stimulus or ideal decision alternative.  The                     proximity of existing decision alternatives to the ideal decision               alternative determines each alternative's utility.  This is not                 possible with existing models.  The model will be tested using                  consumers expressing individual preferences for residential                     alternatives and analysts making consensual public policy                       recommendations.                                                                     Probabalistic choice models were conceived because observed                behavior was too complex to be accounted for by simpler                         deterministic models.  This project continues this tradition by                 seeking to develop a probabalistic choice model that will enhance               the ability to model a variety of complex behaviors.  The                       resulting model will be useful in describing individual as well                 as consensual decision-making.  In addition to its attractive                   mathematical properties, the model opens up a variety of new                    process models for conceptualizing individual decision-making.",
