 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic material isolated from fossils provides a potential                substrate for determining paleoecological and taxonomic                         relationships based on isotopic and amino acid data.  Present                   criteria for evaluating indigeneity has focused on a bulk organic               fraction derived from fossils and includes analysis of amino acid               abundances and enantiomers and comparison of the  13C and  15N                  values of the fossil material to those of the modern organism.                  These criteria incorporate two assumptions that 1) the bulk organic             material is homogeneous and 2) the relative abundance of amino                  acids and the isotopic compositions are comparable to a modern                  analog.  The difficulties with these assumptions are that the bulk              material is not homogeneous but rather composed of several                      different proteins and the organic matrix of fossils may be                     altered. If the diagenetic product obtained from a fossil is a                  consequence of differential loss or retention of specific protein               fractions then the geochemical characteristics and interpretation               of the data are entirely a function of the protein composition of               the organic matrix.  Therefore, more precise and new methods are                needed to assess the effects of diagenesis and derive criteria for              indigeneity.  A better understanding of changes in the organic                  fraction of fossil material over time must include 1) an evaluation             of variation in the relative contributions of each of  the protein              fractions over time, 2) an understanding of the alterations that                occur in the biochemical characteristics of individual protein                  fractions during diagenesis and 3) new molecular level approaches,              such as evaluation of the  13C of individual amino acid enantiomers             (see Justification of explanation).  We anticipate that the                     proposed research will provide unique information on diagenesis                 through molecular level analyses on individual proteins.",
