The research               focuses on American Sign Language (ASL) and American English,                   Brazilian Cities Sign Language (BCSL), a language of the urban                  Brazilian deaf, and Brazilian Portuguese, and Urubu-Kaapor Sign                 Language (UKSL) and Kaapor, these latter two being languages of                 an American Indian group native to the Amazonian region of                      Brazil.  Comparative work of this kind can provide crucial                      evidence for distinguishing constraints imposed by the                          communication medium, both vocal-auditory and gestural-visual,                  from linguistic universals.  Scholars have tended to approach the               analysis of empirical linguistic data as if there were a binary                 division between universality and relativity, without taking into               account the impact of communicative modality.  The inclusion of                 sign language data is crucial not only to the universality versus               relativity debate but also to the understanding of human                        cognition to the extent that such understanding relies on                       linguistic evidence.",
