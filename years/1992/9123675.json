 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) project is an                            internation-al social science consortium currently                              participated in by 18 in- dustrialized nations which have                       agreed to pool microdata on the incomes of families living                      within their diverse economies.  The data so furnished are                      made statistically comparable and stored at a central                           facility in Luxembourg,  where they may be accessed by                          researchers either on-site or remotely through a computerized                   telecommunications network.  The LIS database provides a rich                   resource for multifaceted analyses of income distributions,                     of  systems of cash and noncash income transfers,  of                           relative levels of economic well-being across different                         demographic groupings,  and of many other topics which are                      now,  or soon will be of worldwide societal concern.                                 Support for the data facility is provided by the                           consortium of member nations on a shared-cost basis.  Funds                     provided by the National Science Foundation constitute United                   States participation in the consortium,  and these funds help                   assure that the potential value of the LIS database to U.S.                     social scientists will be realized.  The full cooperation of                    all member nations is required in order to guarantee                            feasibility of data retrieval,  maintenance of high standards                   of data quality,  and gradual relaxation of methodological                      constraints on certain types of data analysis.  National                        Science Foundation funds not only represent U.S. cooperation                    in the enterprise,  they also assure U.S.  involvement in all                   important developmental decisions as well as helping to                         offset the cost of database maintenance and update.  In its                     nearly ten years of existence the results of this                               transnational project have been impressive.",
