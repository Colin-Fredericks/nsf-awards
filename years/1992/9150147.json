In the project, AAAS and ASTC propose to                      provide technical assistance and staff training to science                      museums on equity issues, with emphases on institutional self-                  assessment, developing effective science education programs                     reaching minority audiences, and working effectively with                       community organizations and other institutions serving minority                 groups.  Several museum sites will be involved initially in the                 development of the four program components:                                                                                                                          1.  development of guidelines for an equity self-assessment                in museums;                                                                                                                                                          2.  science equity training for all museum staff;                                                                                                               3.  the development of relationships between museums and                   community groups and schools and colleges and                                   universities that serve minorities; and                                                                                                                              4.  a national effort to create awareness among minority                   groups of employment opportunities in science museums.                                                                                                          Additional dissemination will be provided through training                      workshops and sessions at museum conferences.  A \"how-to\" guide                 and video will be developed for museums on conducting an equity                 self-assessment.                                  //",
