 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics educators, through the NCTM Standards and MAA                       Professional Standards for Teachers of Mathematics, call for                    more active learning at all levels of mathematics education.                    This project is developing a teaching approach for the finite                   mathematics course, taken by elementary education and business                  majors, which implements the goals of these standards in both                   curriculum and instruction. The course materials incorporate                    active and collaborative learning techniques, writing, and a                    problem-solving approach which emphasizes critical thinking.                    The software keep the structure of SEEN, an award-winning                       humanities software program, with tutorials that teach                          mathematical strategies plus a bulletin board that encourages                   peer collaboration.  The SEEN-MATH software is being written so                 that the tutorial inculcates Polya's problem-solving model with                 tools such as graphing and calculator capabilities.  In                         addition, to train and retrain mathematics teachers, thus                       affecting the educational infrastructure, SEEN-MATH is being                    used with elementary education and secondary mathematics                        education majors, and presented in an in-service workshops for                  teachers, allowing them to use the Polya tutorial and also                      adapt the software (in its author mode) to their students and                   classes as a model of active learning.",
