 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports the local costs for the foreign                          participants at the first meeting of the US-USSR Joint                          Commission for Cooperation in the field of Basic                                Scientific Research to be held in Washington, DC on April                       19-20, 1990.  Dr. Bromley, OSTP, and Dr. Nikolay Laverov,                       Chairman of the USSR State Committee for Science and                            Technology will chair the proceedings.                                                                                                                          The Joint Commission was created by the January 1989                            intergovernmental Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of                      Basic Scientific Research.  That agreement, in turn,                            provides the framework for subordinate agency-level                             memoranda of understanding through which the cooperative                        activities are actually implemented.  It is under this                          umbrella that the NSF signed a Memorandum of Understanding                      last May with the Soviet Academy of Sciences.  This                             agreement has given us, for the first time, a direct link                       with the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the ability to                          support investigator-initiated, competitively reviewed                          cooperative research proposals.                                                                                                                                 The Commission's  main task is to review the                                    implementation of this new cooperative program.  It will                        discuss issues and problems, such as the difficulties of                        bridging barriers in the Soviet Union between the Academy                       and the universities, new research topics and emphases,                         and coordination of the global change research between the                      two countries.                                                                                                                                                  This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine                                   complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                       mutual interest and competence in the field of basic                            scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,                      and mutuality of benefit.",
