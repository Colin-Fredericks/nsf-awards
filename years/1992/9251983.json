 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid changes in technology sometimes make obsolete some of the                 more applied parts of an engineering curriculum, which are                      often the laboratories.  This is particularly true of the                       automatic control systems laboratory because of its                             interdisciplinary nature.  Advances in sensor technology,                       microprocessor technology, and the availability of new and more                 efficient actuators have had considerable influence on how                      machines, power plants, manufacturing processes, and automotive                 vehicles are controlled.  Also, the increase in complexity of                   control systems requires both individual and team efforts.  A                   challenge to educators in the control systems area is to                        prepare graduates who have excellent hands-on skills and team                   oriented interpersonal skills.                                                                                                                                  The aim of this project is to provide engineering juniors and                   seniors with a laboratory environment where: (1) they have the                  opportunity to sharpen their hands-on skills by working with                    cost effective state-of-the-art equipment, and (2) they are                     required to work as a highly interactive team.                                                                                                                  The award will be used to purchase a variety of transducers,                    actuators, electromechanical breadboarding kits, and computer                   interfacing equipment.  By working with electromechanical                       breadboarding kits the students can undertake innovative                        laboratory projects. The project provides a laboratory                          experience which fosters team effort and communication skills.                  It impacts about 90 students per year in electrical and                         mechanical engineering departments.",
