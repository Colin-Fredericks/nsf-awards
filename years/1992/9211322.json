 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many applications of geometric modeling in manufacturing or for                 visualization require tangent plane continuous surfaces to                      interpolate data.  While a number of algorithms exist that guarantee            local, analytic smoothness, the resulting surfaces often have                   undesirable extraneous features when compared to a (nonsmooth)                  piecewise linear surface.  Such features are inflection, sharp                  changes of curvature, bulging between the data sites, etc.  The                 functional and aesthetic implications of these 'shape defects' on the           modeled object can be severe.  This project will pinpoint sources and           nature of the features for specific surface constructions and devise            algorithms to systematically modify data and/or the underlying surface          representation in order to reduce or remove the features.  In                   particular, the research will build on the experience with a number of          algorithms and will investigate and quantify the effects of:                    1. a change of continuity constraints across patch boundaries, in               particular, the choice of reparametrization; 2) a perturbation of the           location of data sites and normals; 3) a change of the representation           of the patches; in particular, changing from a polynomial to a                  rational representation; 4) a perturbation of the neighborhood                  relations between the data, such as remeshing by removing or inserting          boundaries.",
