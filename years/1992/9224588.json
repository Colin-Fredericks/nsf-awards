 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large scale disasters challenge the orderly functioning of the                  social system and control of deviance in a social system.                       Hurricane Andrew presents an immediate situation in which to                    examine the breakdown, maintenance, or re-organization of social                control.  This project will explore the impact of the hurriance on              law and informal social control in the Miami area.  Observations                and interviews with law enforcement officials and residents will                be conducted in areas of major impact from the hurricane.  The                  selected sites will provide variations in class and ethnicity of                the affected populations and degree of destruction in the affected              areas.  Supplemental interviews will be conducted with University               of Florida students whose homes are in the hurricane-affected                   areas.                                                                                                                                                          The research is guided by Black's theory of the behavior of law                 and routine activities theory of crime.  The aim is to explore the              interaction for formal and informal control and the extent to which             social control breaks down or is maintained under disaster                      conditions.  Not only will many questions of theoretical                        significance to understanding social control be explored but the                research has immediate practical implications for policy and                    planning in the wake of such disasters.",
