 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed that the National Science Foundation support a GEM               study designed to test models for the source of the field-aligned               currents flowing into the auroral ionosphere.  Utilizing data                   from the magnetometer, electric field probes and particle                       detectors on the S3-3 satellite, the predictions of the Siscoe-                 Sonnerup-Lotko (SSL) model for day-side field-aligned currents                  will be tested.  A preliminary study utilizing existing data                    bases is proposed for the first year.  In the second and third                  years, software will be developed to anlyze the remainder of                    available auroral zones passes which will then be added to the                  data base.  This data base will provide more statistically                      significant tests of SSL and other models of field-aligned                      current generation.  Testing of models of boundary layer sources                of field-aligned currents is critical to the objectives of the                  GEM Boundary Layer Campaign.  Inputs from a study of this type                  will be required to develop more sophisticated and realistic                    models.  Magnetotail sources of currents will also be examined,                 for example by comparing the magnitude of nightside Region 1                    currents to the tail lobe magnetic field for various                            interplanetary magnetic field conditions.  Findings will provide                preliminary constraints on models of coupling and field-aligned                 current generation to be developed as part of the upcoming GEM                  Campaign on Substorms.",
