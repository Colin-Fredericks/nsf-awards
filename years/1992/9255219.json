The Alliance will emphasize a focused effort to               increase directly the recruitment, retention, graduation and                    graduate school placement of Blacks, Hispanics, and Native                      Americans who are enrolled in the undergraduate SEM degree programs             at Albany State and Bethune-Cookman Colleges, Florida A&M and                   Florida International Universities.  Indirectly, enhancement                    elements of the project will influence the persistence of                       minorities at the other alliance member institutions (Florida State             University, University of Central Florida, University of South                  Florida, University of Florida, and Clark-Atlanta University).  The             success of this project will be shared with other state and                     regional institutions.  This project, by applying a holistic                    approach to students' preparation, will emphasize multiple                      components that will positively impact their qualifications for                 graduate school admission.  The Alliance's influence will span from             the pre-freshman level to the enrollment of scholars in SEM                     graduate programs.  Participants will be selected from biology,                 chemistry, mathematics, physics and all engineering disciplines.",
