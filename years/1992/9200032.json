 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Roswell Park Cancer Institute to               sponsor 12 undergraduate students in the Institute's Research                   Participation Program in Science for Undergraduate College                      Students.  The program offers college undergraduates opportunities              to experience laboratory research in preparation for their career               development, particularly in molecular biology and cell biology.                Participants in the program are given intense laboratory                        experiences with a senior investigator on a one to one basis for                ten weeks from June to August.  This laboratory experience nurtures             the participant's research interests and develops their skills in               cell and molecular biology.  The experience should also exert an                influence on their career development leading many to do graduate               work in this area.  Since 1953, the program has had approximately               3,000 participants.  Follow-up data show that 40% of undergraduates             went on to pursue doctoral degrees and many have gone on to                     distinguished careers as research scientists.  The Institute staff              is not required to participate in the Undergraduate Research                    Program, but they look forward to selecting talented students,                  particularly minority students, who are seriously inclined to                   develop careers in science.  While scientists acquaint students                 with the theory and methodologies involved with their research,                 they also assist students in their development of independence and              self motivation.  At weekly seminars, conducted by senior staff and             graduate students, participants are required to describe their                  progress on their laboratory work among their peers.  This                      encourages discussion and broadens their horizons in other areas of             science.  At the end of the program, each student has to write a                short description of their project and give a presentation before               senior staff, guests and peers at a scientific mini-conference.",
