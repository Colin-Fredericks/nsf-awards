 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a new computer laboratory with modern                  equipment.  The goal is to enhance the quality of instruction                   in two of the required Computer Science core courses, namely                    the Operating Systems course and the Assembly Language course.                  The laboratory will consist of 40 486-33 MHz computers.  These                  PCs will be networked together with two as file servers.  In                    addition, 20 of these PCs will be equipped with removable hard                  disk drives.  These machines will enable students of the                        Operating Systems classes to experiment with modifications and                  enhancements of the kernel of a real operating system without                   adverse effect on other users.  Students will be exposed to                     both operating system code development and testing procedures.                  The removable hard disk will allow the same laboratory to be                    used with different software configurations without time                        consuming and complicated reformatting and reloading of systems                 software.  This flexibility will provide an increase of several                 orders of magnitude in the usability of the laboratory.  The                    use of the same platform for both the operating system course                   and the assembly language course will reinforce the knowledge                   obtained in both courses.  The laboratory will also benefit                     other courses, including the Ada Programming Language course                    (which is also a required course for CS/CIS students), as well                  as the general instructional quality of other computer science                  courses including Software Engineering, Computer Graphics and                   Independent Study/Project courses.",
