 "awd_abstract_narration": "Learning Mathematics with Computers                                             The intent of this project is to find ways of presenting                        mathematics to college students, both mathematics majors and                    non-majors, in such a way as to enhance their motivation for                    studying mathematics and to help develop their mathematical                     intuition.  The regular use by students of computers, both in                   the classroom and in homework assignments, allows wide use of                   discovery learning, with its emphasis upon making conjectures                   and testing their validity.  Access to computers allows the                     courses to be taught in ways which emphasize the graphical and                  numerical aspects of mathematics, as well as the analytical.                    This project will impact every student who graduates from                       Franklin College, since all courses which can be utilized to                    meet the graduation requirement are affected. A recently                        awarded grant from Lilly Endowment, Inc., aids in this process                  by providing released time for the investigators for the                        development of course materials. The project uses a 15                          workstation classroom/laboratory equipped with Z-486 computers,                 an EtherWORKS network served by a DEC PCLAN/Server 3100, and                    four Cannon BJ-300 printers served by a DECserver 90L.",
