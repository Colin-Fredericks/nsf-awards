 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many plants are known to increase the intracellular levels of                   phenolic compounds when they are challenged by a wide variety of                stressful conditions including predation.  Many phenolic compounds              are toxic to a wide variety of biotic agents.  In order for plants              to use this defense mechanism, the species must be able to tolerate             the increased level of the phenolic.  Plants reduce the                         autotoxicity of phenolics by conjugating them to other cellular                 constituents.  It has been recently noted that plants may conjugate             some phenolics to glutathione through the action of a glutathione               S-transferase.  Preliminary evidence indicates that the activity                of the enzyme may be regulated by phenolic levels.  The objectives              of this project are to: 1) characterize the glutathione S-                      transferase enzyme; 2) determine if plants synthesize glutathione               conjugates of phenolics in vivo; and 3) determine if there is a                 correlation between stress and glutathione S-transferase activity.              An understanding of the role of glutathione in phenolic conjugation             will aid in the understanding of how plants utilize phenolics                   during times of stress and may provide insight into the endogenous              function of plants GST enzymes.",
