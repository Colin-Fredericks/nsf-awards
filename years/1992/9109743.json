 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is known that there is a range of recovery to different                      kinds of brain damage.  In the visual system of humans, damage to               only the visual cortex of the brain often leaves residual                       functional vision, called \"blindsight\", that presumably depends                 on pathways from the eye to areas other than primary visual                     cortex.  There is evidence that sparing or recovery of visual                   function is greater when cortical damage occurs during infancy                  rather than in an adult.                                                                                                                                        This project investigates some of the mechanisms by which                       such visual recovery in very young animals may be more effective                than recovery of older animals.  Visual detection, localization                 and discrimination will be assessed for the field of vision                     normally represented in the excised tissue (the \"field defect\"),                and recovery will be tracked as a function of time and of                       practice.  Behavioral responses later will be compared to                       responses of single nerve cells in the visual regions of the                    brain outside the lesioned areas, and anatomical studies will                   explore the development of changes in connectivity.  Results are                likely to clarify how recovery in infants occurs better than in                 adults, and so will be very important to our understanding of the               organization and development of the primate and human visual                    system.",
