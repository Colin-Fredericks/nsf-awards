 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History in Texas will                      develop a 4,000 square-foot traveling science exhibit on                        FORENSICS:  The Science of Criminal Investigation for                           circulation to eight major U.S. Cities through the Science                      Museum Exhibit Collaborative (SMEC).  FORENSICS will examine the                scientific methods and technologies used in today's crime labs.                 Core science areas are:  DNA profiling; Fingerprinting; Firearms                Identification; Evidence Collection; Composites; Forensic                       Anthropology; Forensic Entomology; Forensic Geology; Odontology;                Pathology; Serology; toxicology; Trace Evidence.  The                           development of FORENSICS will draw from the expertise of a                      distinguished panel of forensic scientists, law enforcement                     officers, and science educators.                                                                                                                                FORENSICS will foster science process skills, problem-solving,                  and deductive reasoning by challenging visitors to solve a crime                mystery.  A Teacher's Resource Guide to the exhibit will promote                indepth classroom investigations of forensics for middle grade                  (5-9) science lessons.  The exhibit will open in Fort Worth in                  May of 1993, and then tour nationally to eight major U.S.                       cities, serving over 2.5 million American citizens during its                   SMEC travel itinerary.//",
