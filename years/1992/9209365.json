 "awd_abstract_narration": "Language has evolved rich vocabularies, especially action verbs and             their modifiers, that can felicitously describe simple as well as               complex movements performed by humans and others.  The overall long             term goal is to model the structure of human-like agents, instruct              them in natural language to perform simple physical tasks, and                  display e actions being performed in terms of computer graphics                 animation.  The research addresses selected problems, issues and                methods of solutions in the overall endeavor.  The PI's Ph.D.                   dissertation(1990, University of Pennsylvania). argued that it is               necessary to investigate how natural language relates to concepts               of space, motion and force, and use these relations in the                      specification of lexical semantics of action verbs and their                    modifiers.  In the proposed research, we will further strengthen                the claims of obtaining useful lexical entries for an extended set              of action verbs and their modifiers.  We will investigate salient               functional, structural and other properties of manipulated objects              and the physical environment in general, required for motion bases              on the structure, function and other relevant constrain: this is                crucial to actually executing tasks specified by natural language               instructions in varying physical situations.  Meaning entries                   (given in natural language) for action verbs in human dictionaries              and determine the nature of processing necessary to use such                    entries for possible acquisition of new computational lexical                   entries.",
