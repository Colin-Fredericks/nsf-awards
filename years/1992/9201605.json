 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lee         This research deals with design methodology for  heterogeneous implementations of signal processing systems. Some  signal processing algorithms consist of highly repetitive,  predictable computations on streams of samples with hard real-  time constraints, and are amenable to synchronous dataflow  representations and static (compile-time) scheduling. Other  algorithms involve some decision making or run-time control flow,  and can be accommodated efficiently by a broader dataflow model  that includes run-time flow control. When such algorithms are  combined into complete systems, more dynamics must be supported,  and discrete-event principles, or real-time operating systems  must be included. This research is looking at ways to combine  diverse semantics, and is pursuing co-simulation techniques and  understanding of the interaction between what formal methods are  available within each model of computation. A design framework  (called Ptolemy) that supports all these models, individually or  in combination, is being developed as a testbed.",
