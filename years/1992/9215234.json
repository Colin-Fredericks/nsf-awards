 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the humanities and sciences alike, electronic networks are                   increasingly used to access, disseminate, and work with research                data and to communicate with colleagues in connection with this                 research.  The imminent development of the National Research and                Education Network (NREN) is greatly accelerating this process, but              also brings with it the need to develop structures of                           communication, collaboration, and critical control which are                    largely unprecedented.  Basic questions about what is feasible and              what is desirable need to be addressed.  We also have little shared             understanding of how to handle the problem of network management so             as to insure the preservation of academic autonomy.                                                                                                             In view of this, twenty-five experts in network development,                    database design, electronic information management, and network                 user research are being convened to consider how to turn to maximum             advantage the opportunities implicit in the development of NREN as              a medium for research and education.                                                                                                                            Rapid experimental prototyping is needed, and at this                           symposium/workshop, a substantive conception of an electronic                   research and learning environment will be presented as a hypothesis             to be critiqued systematically by the participants in the interest              of establishing a concrete understanding of what is required to                 make such a prototype intellectually sound and technologically and              fiscally feasible.                                                                                                                                              The results of this symposium will be reported to decision makers               in the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National                   Science Foundation.",
