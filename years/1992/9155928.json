 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project undertakes a systematic restructuring of how                       introductory digital logic design is taught.  The same                          computer-based tools used to carry out logic design by                          practicing engineers is brought to bear on the learning                         process.  The use of workstations in the classroom and by                       students for simulation, computation and optimization is                        emphasized.  The restructuring effort will begin with two                       short-term objectives:  to develop new homework problems and                    other learning activities which make use of logic simulation                    software, and to provide student access to a multimedia                         electronic knowledgebase dealing with digital logic design.                     The homework problems developed and a videotape describing the                  multimedia knowledgebase will be made available to other                        academic institutions for the cost of duplication.  Results                     will be disseminated at the Frontiers in Education conference.",
