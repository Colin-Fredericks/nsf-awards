 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop and test theories of human              similarity processing.  Similarity provides the basis for much of               concept learning, transfer of knowledge from one situation to                   another, and generalization.  Conversely, similarity can also be a              source of human error, for instance when confusions between                     similar-looking materials or devices occur.  This research will                 develop a new approach to encompass a range of human similarity                 processes, from causal and functional similarities to perceptual                similarities.  This approach departs from prior approaches in                   emphasizing the psychological processes that underlie similarity.                                                                                               The first set of studies will investigate interconnectivity, i.e.,              whether interactions between features can make some aspects of                  objects more salient in similarity judgments or even change the                 psychological interpretation of their properties.  The second issue             is the effect of alignment in judgments of the similarity of two                figures.  These studies will investigate how the seeming similarity             between two figures changes as a function of how easy it is to                  place components of object representation in correspondence.  A                 third set of studies will investigate the effect of similarity in               constructive induction.  These studies are based on the hypothesis              that when people judge similarity, they sometimes align non-                    identical features in a way which captures only their abstract                  commonalities.  For example, two engines, one missing a fan belt                and the other with a broken generator, may be judged similar                    because they have dysfunctional parts.  These research results will             inform us about the range and flexibility of similarity processing.                                                                                             The next set of studies will address the dynamic process of                     similarity computation.  In these studies, people will be asked to              perform rapid similarity matches or will view similarity pairs for              varying periods; this will allow comparison of fast and slow                    similarity judgments.  If fast judgments have dynamics different                from slow, interfaces and devices to which humans must respond                  quickly will have to be designed accordingly.                                                                                                                   The final set of studies will investigate the role of similarity in             other cognitive processes.  Some experiments will examine the role              of similarity in category-based induction.  For example, when                   people are told a new fact about some entity, (e.g., a tiger) they              typically assume that the fact applies to other similar entities,               (e.g., a lion).  This research will investigate whether the                     similarity is symmetrical or directional and what aspects of the                similarity affect further inferences that can be made.  Other                   experiments will investigate whether the process of retrieval from              memory can change the subsequent representation of the items.  If               items stored in memory are changed by the process that retrieves                them, it suggests how gradual learning can occur and how certain                similarity-based distortions can come about.",
