 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will foster illustration, interpretation, and                      integration of theoretical concepts in communication, signal                    processing, and control systems through the use of a modern                     computer laboratory.  Undergraduate students will be exposed                    early to a state-of-the-art networked computing system, the X-                  Window environment, and several high-level computational tools.                 The hands-on laboratory experiments in an introductory lab                      course will develop in the sophomore students the ability to                    simulate waveforms, noise, simple filters, and basic linear                     systems.  To enhance the pivotal course in signal and system                    theory, the junior level students will experiment with the                      numerical simulation of a broad variety of signals and systems.                 In the laboratory courses associated with the senior level                      courses, students will experiment with the simulation and                       design of realistic communication, control, and signal                          processing systems.  In addition, the laboratory will be an                     important resource for senior design projects.  This laboratory                 will provide students with better insight into the fundamental                  concepts of communication and control.  At the same time, it                    will better prepare students for both modern industry and                       graduate school.  Equipment to be purchased includes:  26 X-                    Window terminals, additional processors, memory and disk drive                  for the existing Sparc-class server, and networking hardware.                   The ease of use of this equipment by undergraduate students                     will be achieved by developing an optimized X-Window graphical                  user interface, course materials, class projects, an electronic                 library of problems and solutions, and by providing the                         students with an introduction to modern computing and                           simulation software within the first laboratory course.",
