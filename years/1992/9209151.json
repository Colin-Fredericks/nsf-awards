 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cycle of dissolved organic matter in riverine saltmarsh                     estuaries is remarkably non-conservative.  In the Parker River -                Plum Island Sound estuary of northern Massachusetts there are                   major inputs of DOC from rivers and from the sea, but there are                 also large inputs from fresh and saline tidal marshes and from                  estuarine phytoplankton.  Through the use of stable isotope                     tracers we can follow the production and consumption of DOC from                these different sources.  The emerging view is that the large                   background of terrestrial and oceanic DOC is relatively refractory              while fresh DOC from algae and marshes is largely responsible for               the high rates of bacterial activity in these systems.  The algae               and marshes at times produce large quantities of DOC that are not               immediately consumed by bacteria and are thus available for                     transport with the tides.  In this proposal, the investigators                  couple the stable isotope approach with ecosystem modeling to                   calculate the ecosystem level fluxes of DOC from these different                sources and to estimate the microbial consumption and export of                 dissolved organic matter from each source.",
