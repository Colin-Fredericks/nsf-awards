 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on finding efficient techniques for producing                  solutions to logic synthesis and physical design problems both                  simultaneously and interactively.  Two problem areas are being                  investigated: integrating logic synthesis with physical design; and             layout algorithms for Boolean networks.  In the first area, a                   prototype synthesis system which is capable of making synthesis                 decisions based on both logic level information and detailed data               about the interconnecting wires and characteristics of the physical             media is being developed.  The key idea is to generate a placement              of the Boolean network that captures the structure of the layout.               The correspondence between logic and layout representations is                  maintained during iterations.  Both technology independent and                  technology dependent logic transformations are accommodated.  In                the second area, ways to assign the I/O pads or place the nodes of              an unmapped Boolean network, where the nodes still have technology              independent logic realizations, are being investigated.  Physical               design tools which effectively capture the structural                           characteristics of Boolean networks and can handle nodes of inexact             or approximate area, intrinsic delay and drive are being developed.             Accurate and efficient modeling of interconnect during logic                    synthesis and layout plays a key role in the algorithm development.",
