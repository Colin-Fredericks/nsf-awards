Previous                                                            three-dimensional models either                                                 have been static or quasi-static                                                and, therefore, the models cannot                                               predict the effects of dynamic                                                  inertial loads which occur in many                                              locomotor activities.  Only                                                     two-dimensional dynamic models have                                             been investigated to date.                                                                                                                                      The model that will be developed                                                will consist of two body segments,                                              a femur and a tibia, constrained by                                             ligamentous forces.  Changes that                                               occur with time in joint position,                                              joint reaction forces, contact                                                  point locations between femur and                                               tibia, and ligament forces will be                                              calculated.                                                                                                                                                     This research is important since it                                             will lead to a more complete                                                    knowledge of how knee injuries                                                  occur.  Most damage to the knee                                                 takes place in dynamic situations,                                              which is the focus of this project.                                             The approach that will be develop                                               also could be used in modeling                                                  other articulating joints.",
