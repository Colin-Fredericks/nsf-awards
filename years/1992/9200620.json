 "awd_abstract_narration": "A set of seven proposals and two supplement requests was                   submitted for participation in an international marine atmospheric              chemistry experiment.  The Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition in the             eastern North Atlantic during June 1992, is a multinational effort              designed to improve our capability for studying cloud-chemistry                 interactions and the air/sea fluxes that affect them.  The specific             goals of the MAGE atmospheric chemistry experiment in ASTEX                     include:  1) develop and test a Lagrangian strategy for studying                chemical and meteorological evolution in a tagged airmass, using                ships, balloons, and aircraft; 2) develop and test new techniques               for estimating trace-gas and aerosol fluxes across the air/sea                  interface by comparison with traditional approaches; 3) evaluate                the impact of marine and continental aerosols and the formation and             dissipation of stratocumulus clouds; 4) compare the impacts of                  natural and anthropogenic sulfur, halogens, and hydrocarbons on                 marine aerosol chemistry; and 5) use a multinational, multi-agency              field experiment as a means for addressing tropospheric chemistry               issues.                                                                                                                                                              In this MAGE proposal, the PIs propose to conduct measurements             of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in ocean water and sulfur dioxide and DMS             in air from shipboard in the study area of ASTEX.  The primary                  objective is to determine the DMS content in the ocean along the                track of the parcel sampled in a Lagrangian experiment.  The PIs                propose to compute the DMS flux along the parcel trajectory using               a thin film model.  Then, the DMS flux data would be used to reduce             the number of variables in the Lagrangian budget analysis or to                 test the reliability of DMS flux data obtained directly from the                budget analysis.  Secondary objectives include the determination of             DMS and sulfur dioxide in air before and after the air parcel                   passes over the ship.  These data would provide information on the              horizontal variation of DMS and sulfur dioxide upwind and downwind              of the air parcel.  These measurements would compliment those                   obtained from an aircraft platform because the aircraft will not                sample exactly the same air parcel during the Lagrangian                        experiment.  The PIs also propose to obtain sufficient data to                  characterize the diurnal variation of DMS and sulfur dioxide to aid             in testing chemical models of the marine boundary layer.",
