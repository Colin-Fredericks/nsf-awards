 "awd_abstract_narration": "The City University of New York (CUNY) is an academic network of                nine senior colleges, seven community colleges, a 4-year technical              college, a graduate school, a law school and two medical schools.               The network is geographically distributed throughout the entire                 city, with a total residential population of more than seven                    million.  The New York City Alliance will consist of twelve                     campuses within CUNY, comprising bother 2 year and 4-year colleges,             working together with private colleges, members of the business                 community and national laboratories.  The initial CUNY college                  partners will be four senior colleges (Brooklyn College, City                   College, Hunter College and Lehman College), a 4-year technical                 college (New York City Technical College) and seven community                   colleges (borough of Manhattan Community College, Bronx Community               College, Hostos Community College, Kinsgborough Community College,              La Guardia Community College, Medgar Evers College \u0131which has both              2- and 4-year programs! and Queensborough Community College).                                                                                                   The principal project activities will involve undergraduate                     science, engineering and mathematics (SEM) education, focusing on               the points in students' undergraduate experience which are most                 likely, without intervention, to precipitate a decision to drop out             of the science and engineering pipeline.  The transitions from 2-               year to 4-year colleges and into graduate school will be                        specifically addressed by AMP project activities.  Although not                 included in the seven proposed AMP activities, the transition rom               high school to college is currently served by as number of existing             programs involving the partner colleges and will be coordinated                 under AMP auspices.                                                                                                                                             The AMP activities will bring about wide-scale deployment of                    programs proved in pilot projects; complement related activities                funded by state, private and other federal sources' produce a                   significantly greater degree of coordination among the CUNY                     partners; and bring greater involvement of outside partners,                    private colleges, government laboratories and industry.  Our goal               will be to create a \"seamless whole\" of interventions at the                    undergraduate level that respond to each of the factors that impled             minority student success.",
