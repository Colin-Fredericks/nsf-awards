 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of hybridization is important in evolutionary biology                 because it reveals the forces at work in the final stages of                    speciation.  Some populations of animal species commonly hybridize,             but it is usually difficult if not impossible to determine the                  causes hybridization in nature.  The proposed research takes                    advantage of an exceptionally favorable situation for investigating             the causes of hybridization and the reasons for relatively high                 fitness of the hybrids.  On the small island of Daphne Major in the             Galapagos archipelago the medium ground finch, Geospza fortis,                  occasionally interbreeds with two others; G. scandens, a resident               species, and G. fuliginosa, an immigrant.  Pedigree analysis has                shown that hybrids may survive and breed as well or better than the             parental species, over several years.  Ecological reasons for their             fitness will be investigated by intensive study of feeding                      efficiencies and diets.  Possible advantages arising from enhanced              heterozygosity will be assessed by an analysis of inbreeding                    effects in the G. fortis and G. scandens populations.  Causes of                interbreeding will be identified by statistical analysis of mating              patterns.  Results will be of theoretical importance to our                     understanding of speciation and the role of hybridization in                    maintaining genetic variation in small and potentially endangered               populations.",
