 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harvard College Observatory proposes to create teacher                          training videos and workshop materials which will help science                  teachers understand and cope with misconceptions in science.                    Building on a body of research which has been done in this                      area, a series of teacher-training video tapes will be                          developed and made available to teachers on a nation wide                       basis.  Six 28-minute tapes will address misconceptions in the                  fields of biology, chemistry, earth science, engineering,                       mathematics, and physics. An additional set of six 30-minute                    workshop tapes will contain sample student and teacher                          interviews and samples of both effective and ineffective                        teaching methods, and will be accompanied by activity books.                    A panel of six teachers with a background in misconception                      research will serve in summer workshops as an advisory group                    in the development of the materials.  The video tape series                     and workshop materials will be derived from the work pioneered                  in Project Star; the tapes will be an extension of the pilot                    video, A Private Universe.  There is a cost-sharing is 37% of                   the amount requested from NSF.",
