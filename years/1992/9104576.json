 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on studies of the biosynthesis and function               of D-LAMP-2, a Dictyostelium protein which appears to be a                      homologue of the human lysosomal associated membrane protein 2 (H-              LAMP-2).  Antibodies to H-LAMP-2 and oligonucleotide probes will                be used to clone and sequence the cDNA coding for D-LAMP-2.                     Radiolabel pulse-chase, microscopy, and subcellular fractionation               approaches will be used to examine the transport and processing of              D-LAMP-2 in growing cells, and in mutant Dictyostelium cells                    altered in secretion and transport of lysosomal hydrolases.  The                biosynthesis and intracellular location of D-LAMP-2 will also be                examined as a function of the developmental cycle of Dictyostelium.             Also, antisense RNA and gene disruption techniques will be used to              generate strains unable to produce D-LAMP-2.  The function of the               lysosomal system will be assessed by: determining if \"normal\"                   lysosomes are formed; examining the transport, sorting, and                     secretion of lysosomal enzymes; measuring the rate of endocytosis               and phagocytosis; and determining if cells undergo normal                       differentiation.  Together, these approaches will provide relevant              new information on the role of LAMPs in the biosynthesis and                    function of lysosomes in growing and differentiating cells.                                                                                                     Until now, most studies on lysosomal biogenesis (in both animal and             slime mold systems) have focused on how the lysosomal enzymes enter             the lysosomal compartment.  Recently, a few lysosomal membrane                  marker proteins have been identified in mammalian cells; while                  these have been well characterized with respect to protein                      structure, there is as yet no clue as to their possible function.               The discovery of a possible homologue of one of these lysosomal                 membrane proteins in the slime mold Dictyostelium comes at a                    fortuitous time, since it is only recently that Dictyostelium has               become readily amenable to genetic and molecular-genetic                        manipulations.  It is now possible to create mutant strains of the              cells with specific genetic alterations.  By creating mutants with              specific alterations in the LAMP homologue, and assessing the                   resultant phenotypes with respect to lysosomal function, it should              be possible to address the question of function of these proteins.",
