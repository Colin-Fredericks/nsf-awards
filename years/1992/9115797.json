 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today, tools are needed to support and promote the use of formalisms            in designing software interfaces concurrent algorithms, and digital             circuits.  Such tools must provide assistance with assessing the                semantic content of designs, not just with their syntax.  This project          involves development of one such tool, the Larch Prover (LP).  Current          applications of LP include debugging Larch specifications, reasoning            about circuit designs, and reasoning about concurrent algorithms.  The          project will continue developing LP in support of these and other               applications, e.g., reasoning about specification in Larch and other            specification languages, making use of specifications in optimizing             compilers, and verifying locking levels in Modula-3.                                                                                                            The project will develop front ends to serve as interfaces between              these applications and LP.  It will also enhance LP to serve better as          a back end for such applications.  Projected enhancements to LP                 include more general quantification, additional inference mechanisms            (congruence closure, decision procedures for linear orders), and                further assistance for handling complex proofs ( scoping,                       polymorphism, proof management).  These enhancements will be driven by          the demands of applications: they will be made within a context that            is oriented towards debugging proofs and that emphasizes ease of                interaction, good performance, proof strategies based on                        simplification, and replayable proof scripts.",
