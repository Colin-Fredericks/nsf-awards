 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships                are awards to recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the                      mathematical sciences.  These awards are a means of contributing to             the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation.  As                 researchers in the mathematical sciences expand their interactions              with other disciplines, and as the interplay increases between the              various areas of mathematics itself, opportunities for postdoctoral             research and training are becoming increasingly important.  The                 fellowships are designed to permit awardees to choose research                  environments that will have maximal impact on their future                      scientific development.  The fellowship is designed to provide 24               months of support divided into 18 academic-year months and 3                    periods of two summer months.  The recipient may choose (1) the                 Research Fellowship option which allows for full-time support for               any 18 academic-year months in a three-year period, in intervals                not shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2) the Research                       Instructorship option which allows the 18 months of academic year               support to be taken as 9 months of full-time support and 18 months              of half-time support.  Not more than two months of summer support               from this Fellowship may be received in any calendar year.                           Toniann Pitassi will receive her doctoral degree from the                  University of Toronto, and will pursue research under the guidance              of Russell Impagliazzo at the University of California, San Diego.              The research will be conducted in the area of the connections                   between logic and complexity theory.",
