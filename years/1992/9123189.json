 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will incorporate and apply ideas and techniques               from representation theory and group actions to the cohomology of               groups. The main objectives are as follows:                                     1) Extend an ongoing project to calculate and interpret the mod-2               cohomology of certain key finite groups.  The hope is to find a                 set of useful examples which will lead to further theoretical                   developments in the field, as has happened in the past.                         2) Analyze the cohomology and K-theory of certain discrete groups               such as arithmetic groups and mapping class groups, using                       methods from modular representation theory as well as a recent                   splitting result in K-theory.                                                  3) Apply methods from equivariant K-theory to certain G-complexes               associated to a finite group G.  This is motivated by a conjecture              in modular representation theory involving the isotopy groups of                the complex.                                                                         Groups are the abstract mathematical embodiment of symmetry.               They are ubiquitous in mathematics and in many mathematical                     applications to the other sciences, being well nigh indispensable               in quantum mechanics.  As such, one cannot underestimate the                    importance of efforts to understand their properties even better                than we do now - there is no telling where such understanding will              pay off, but mathematical physics is a plausible assumption.  This              project is in a sense a bootstrap project, for cohomology is                    already a theory based on groups, the various cohomology groups.                The investigator has been very successful in applying the                       cohomology groups in studying the structure and properties of other             groups, particularly certain of the so-called finite sporadic                   groups which had defeated the efforts of others.  His project will              advance both by making difficult calculations and by evolving                   theory to bring order to the results of these calculations.",
