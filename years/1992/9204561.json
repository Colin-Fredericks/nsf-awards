 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to gain an understanding of the               molecular mechanisms of lymphoid V(D)J recombination and DNA                    double-strand break (DSB) repair. These two pathways share at least             one common factor, the SCID (severe combined immune deficiency)                 gene product and probably share many others.  In particular, we                 intend to determine whether this overlap can be extended to the                 murine wasted mutation, which confers onto affected animals a                   severe immune deficiency and a sensitivity to ionizing radiation.               The high cancer rate associated with DNA repair defects suggests                that generalized DSB repair is also critical for many other                     important biological processes including chromosome integrity and               stability, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis as well as lymphoid V(D)J             recombination.  These two important biological pathways will be                 characterized using 3 lines of experimentation:  1)Does the wasted              (wst) mutation affect the process of V(D)J recombination?  2)What               are the DNA repair defects associated with the wst and scid                     mutations?  3)Do the scid and wst mutations affect homologous                   and/or illegitimate (non-homologous) recombination?                             %%%%                                                                            The ultimate goal of these studies will be to use the scid and wst              mutations as tools to understand the molecular mechanisms of                    lymphoid gene rearrangement and DNA repair.",
