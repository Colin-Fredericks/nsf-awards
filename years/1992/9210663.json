 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the Townsend movement which worked to                   secure pensions for the aged in the Depression.  The Townsend                   movement may have included as many as one-fifth of the aged at                  the start of 1936.  The study will examine how the Townsend                     movement grew and spread throughout the United States, and it                   will examine what effects this movement may have had on                         public spending for old people.  The study will use statistical                 methods to analyze data collected from historical archives around               the country and from polling data about the strengths of the                    Townsend movement and other movements trying to gain support for                pensions for the aged.                                                               The study's focus on the outcomes of a popular social                      movement, such as the Townsend movement, is one of the strengths                of the study.  Another strength is its combination of good                      history with systematic quantitative analysis.",
