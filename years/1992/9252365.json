 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces undergraduate civil engineering majors                  to the new and exciting field of environmental geotechnics.  A                  new undergraduate course is being introduced at Purdue                          University. using state-of-the-art laboratory equipment. The                    course is a combined instructional/laboratory course that                       provides the students with an understanding of all aspects of                   hazardous waste site assessment and instrumentation from the                    discovery that a hazardous waste site exists through to                         establishing safety and management strategies and culminating                   in an extensive evaluation of scientific equipment for                          assessing the type and extent of contamination in the air, soil                 and water.  An  integral component of the course is the weekly                  laboratory sessions where the students will become familiar                     with the operation of a range of different modern scientific                    devices which are used to monitor and assess surface and                        subsurface conditions.  The development plan also incorporates                  preparation of video instructional materials and is linked to                   future research experiences for undergraduates.",
