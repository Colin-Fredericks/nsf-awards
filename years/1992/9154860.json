 "awd_abstract_narration": "In fall of 1995, the Denver Museum of Natural History                      (DMNH) will open the Prehistoric Life Exhibits in 17,000                        square feet of new exhibition space.  The exhibits will be                      part of an on-going renaissance in paleontology at DMNH that                    includes research, educational programming, teacher                             training, and collections management.                                                Visitors will walk through a series of nine life-size,                     open, prehistoric habitat dioramas -- \"enviroramas\"--                           representing principally regional sites that feature                            critical events in 3.5 billion-year history of life on                          Earth.  An extension of the Museum's tradition of diorama                       excellence, the enviroramas will immerse visitors in a                          multisensory journey, underscoring the message that vast                        amounts of both time and change have occurred since life                        began on Earth.  Focus area exhibits adjacent to each                           envirorama will invite visitors to examine fossil evidence                      and scientific processes.  Layered presentations will enable                    visitors to discover, explore, and study according to their                     level of interest.  Excellent specimens, interpretive                           exhibitry and hands-on components will allow visitors to                        gain awareness of past patterns of environmental change and                     to develop literacy about and appreciation for how science                      and technology contribute to interpreting the fossil record.                    A comprehensive evaluation program will ensure that focus                       area exhibits are effective and provide visitors with \"new                      eyes\" for viewing the enviroramas.                                                   During exhibit construction, visitors will be able to                      watch from the viewing area of a state-of-the-art fossil                        preparation laboratory, completed in l990, as preparators                       rearticulate the skeletons of Diplodocus, Stegosaurus and                       other fossils.  As part of their Prehistoric Life Exhibits                      experience, visitors will be able to witness on-going                           science activities in the laboratory.  The National Science                     Foundation is requested to contribute $1 million over three                     years toward the $5.3 million Prehistoric Life Exhibits                         project.  The exhibition and associated programming will be                     a major cultural and educational resource for the Rocky                         Mountain region , potentially reaching a diverse audience of                    well over a million Museum visitors and program participants                    annually.",
