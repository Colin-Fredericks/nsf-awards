 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among cooperatively-breeding birds and mammals, offspring from                  previous broods delay independent breeding, remain with their                   parents, and assist in rearing subsequent broods.  One possible                 explanation for this behavior is the \"skills\" hypothesis, which                 argues that young need this period of time to learn the skills                  required for successful foraging and nesting.                                                                                                                   Using a mixture of field experimental and descriptive techniques,               Dr. Vehrencamp and her students will investigate the process by                 which young birds acquire adult foraging skills in the                          cooperatively-breeding magpie jay, an intelligent, tropical                     species with an extremely broad diet and diverse array of                       foraging tactics.  By determining the types of information                      transmitted by social learning and the mechanisms that promote                  social learning (copying or imitation) in this species, Dr.                     Vehrencamp will be better able to assess the relative importance                of individual (trial-and-error) learning and social learning of                 complex behavior in animals.                                                                                                                                    Ultimately, such research on animals should help to pinpoint the                constraints upon the reliance on social learning for the                        acquisition of novel behavior and thus why copying and cultural                 variation are primarily human traits.",
