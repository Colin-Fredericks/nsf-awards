 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Santa Cruz Mudstone is a thick unit (approximately 2000m)             of siliceous mudstones in north-central California that appears to              be correlative with the upper part of the Miocene Monterey                      Formation.  The unit is exposed in the Bolinas-Point Reyes and                  Santa Cruz areas where it has been significantly offset by movement             along the San Andreas fault system.  The age, stratigraphy, and                 paleoceanography of the Santa Cruz Mudstones are poorly known.  The             major objectives of a multi-year study on the Santa Cruz Mudstone               would be:  (1) to precisely date the age of the Santa Cruz Mudstone             using diatom biostratigraphy, (2) to describe and document                      stratigraphic cycles between silica-rich and carbonate-rich rocks,              and (3) to assess the timing and paleoceanographic significance of              prominent bedding cycles and other stratigraphic variations within              the Santa Cruz Mudstone.  A planning period will facilitate                     preliminary data collection and the effective evaluation of a                   multi-year research plan.  Two major objectives during the planning             year are:  (1) to conduct reconnaissance field work and sampling                (for diatoms) and (2) evaluate and synthesize field and age data                and write a competitive multi-year research proposal.  The most                 significant aspect of this investigation is the results are                     expected to reflect complex climate and sea level variations during             the late Miocene.  Results such as these will increase our                      understanding of sediments deposited beneath ancient upwelling,                 high fertility systems.",
