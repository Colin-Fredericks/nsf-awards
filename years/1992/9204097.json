 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his study of C-R                  geometry and holomorphic maps. He will use methods from analysis                such as estimates for the d\"-operator as well as geometric                      techniques including folliations determined by the Monge-Ampere                 operator. In another direction, the principal investigator will                 study iterations of polynomial maps in several complex variables.               He will continue his investigation of properties of Julia sets                  and the ergodic properties of the maps.                                              This award will support research in the general area of                    differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry                is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space                and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is                  the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of                a space by piecing together local information. Applications of                  these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the                        structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and                  the large scale structure of the universe.",
