 "awd_abstract_narration": "The control of the mitotic and meiotic behavior of eukaryotic                   chromosomes is essential for genetic stability of cells during                  growth and reproduction.  An understanding of the cis- and trans-               acting elements that are required for proper chromosome behavior is             therefore of critical importance.  The focus of the investigations              in our laboratory is on the structure present at the ends of the                eukaryotic chromosome, called the telomere.  The goal of this                   proposal is to investigate the function of the predominant yeast                telomere binding protein, RAP1.  To begin to understand the role of             RAP1 at the yeast telomere two approaches are being proposed: a)                the biochemical and genetic characterization of a series of novel               semi-dominant alleles of RAP1 that specifically influence a number              of telomere-related processes, and b) a genetic study of the                    interactions between RAP1 and other gene products affecting                     telomere length.  These studies will ultimately be applied to the               isolation and characterization of extragenic suppressors of rap|                mutations: a key step in the identification of factors interacting              with RAP1 in its role at the telomere.",
