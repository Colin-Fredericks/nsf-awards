 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI spent a year at the National Center for Supercomputing                   (NCSA) looking at the potential applications of high                            performance computers to the solution of chemical engineering                   problems.  Since then he has worked with NCSA in the area of                    developing network access to supercomputers.  The Dow Chemical                                                                                                  Company is an industrial partner of NCSA.  The PI has also                      been working with Dow on the remote use of supercomputers via                   high speed, wide area networks.  As a result of these                           activities, the PI and Dow are establishing a cooperative                       research program in the area of chemical process applications                   of high performance computers.                                                                                                                                  The specific purpose of the project is to evaluate the current                                                                                                  technology associated with frame accurate video recording                       applied to the interpretation and archival storage of                           scientific databases.  Two databases:  computed results from a                                                                                                  complex chemical reactor simulation and measured data from an                   experimental investigation will provide the information used                    for the evaluation.  Equipment and software assembled at Dow                    as an implementation of an NCSA project called \"NCSA Video                      Macintosh - Producing Scientific Visualizations on a Desktop\"                   will be used in the project.  Four specific activities are                      planned:                                                                                                                                                          1. Daily contact among the principals during the planning                     period      for the initiation of the program;                                    2. Familiarization of graduate research assistants with the                                                                                                           procedures and equipment employed in industrial                         laboratories;                                                                     3. Training of graduate research assistants in the use of                                                                                                            contemporary high performance computing equipment; and                                                                                                     4. Design of the experimental apparatus involved in                           evaluating      the performance of a flow reversal reactor.//",
