 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several mathematical problems situated at the interface                    between harmonic analysis and probability theory will be                        addressed in this project. The application of probability theory                to questions of mathematical analysis has a rich history of                     success in refocusing the point of view and providing new,                      powerful methods.                                                                    Among the targets of this work is an examination of                        Khintchine's inequality for lacunary trigonometric series.  This                inequality bounds the p-norm of the Rademacher expansion of a                   function by sums of (squares of) the coefficient.  The same type                of inequality obtains if a lacunary expansion is used.  Efforts                 will be made to show that the constant in the lower bound can be                estimated accurately enough to measure its dependence on the p-th               power.                                                                               A second line of investigation concerns tail laws of the                   iterated logarithm for harmonic functions. This law, discovered                 by Kolmogorov in 1950,  measures partial sums of trigonometric                  series against the sum of squares of its coefficients.  The tail                law is similar except that it compares only the tail of the                     series and tail of the coefficients.  Recently analogous results                have been obtained in which harmonic functions are compared with                iterated logarithms of their gradients. Current work seeks to                   give estimates of corresponding tail comparison.                                     Other work seeks to relate developments of exponential                     martingales with classical Littlewood-Paley theory.",
