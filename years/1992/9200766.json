 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Henry Bunn, Mr. Michael Marchbanks a                 graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, will collect                   data for his doctoral dissertation. He will assemble ceramics                   from the site of Tiwanaku and immediate surrounding environs in                 Bolivia. All were collected during careful archaeological                       excavation and thus derive from known cultural contexts. He will                then conduct lipid analysis in an attempt to determine the foods                and other organic materials which were either stored, cooked or                 consumed in these vessels. To do this he will also acquire modern               samples and ethnographic information from local inhabitants and                 markets to provide a controlled baseline. With such data it                     should be possible to answer a number of important questions                    about the subsistence practices and social organization of                      Tiwanaku's inhabitants.                                                                                                                                         Tiwanaku is a major monumental architectural site, occupying an                 area of approximately 8 square kilometers. Inhabited from                       approximately 1000 BC to AD 1200 it saw the rise of the earliest                kingdom in the Andes. Research conducted by a University of                     Chicago team headed by Dr. Alan Kolata has reconstructed much of                the history of the site and this provides the broader context                   within which Mr. Marchbanks work will take place. His analysis                  should accomplish several goals. First it will increase knowledge               of subsistence practices because it is likely that some types of                food were traded into the region over long distances. Secondly,                 it will help to elucidate the role which trade played in the rise               of this early Empire. The work will also provide insight into the               internal organization at Tiwanaku because, on the basis of the                  distribution of particular types of food it should be possible to               determine the social status of individuals who inhabited                        different parts of the site.                                                                                                                                    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also help to                   pioneer the application of analytic chemical techniques which,                  hopefully, will be of use in many archaeological situations.                    Finally it will help to train an extremely promising young                      scientist.",
