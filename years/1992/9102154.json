 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sub-Micrometer particles in marine plankton systems may play                    important roles in the basic chemistry and biology of the system,               in population and food web dynamics and in biogeochemical                       cycling.  Particles in the picoplankton size range include living               microorganisms, viruses and non-living detrital particles.  The                 abundance, size spectra and fluorescent nature of these various                 particles can be measured using image analyzed epifluorescence                  microscopy.  With funding from the \"Long-Lead Time Development                  Program\" of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study, a sensitive,                  accurate image analysis system, has been developed, based on a                  cooled CCD camera, to automate these measurements of natural                    samples.  This award which constitutes a renewal of the past                    award is to upgrade the spatial resolution of the system to                     increase the precision of the size measurements of these                        particles.  The instrument will than be used for the                            characterization of small particles in terms of population                      abundances, size spectra, and fluorochrome staining.  The system                will be calibrated using known virus concentrates to determine if               they can be distinguished from small bacteria based on their size               and fluorescence characteristics.  The instrument will be used to               characterize particle populations at the JGOFS Bermuda Time                     Series station and in local estuarine waters.  Samples will also                be analyzed by electron microscopy as well as for carbon and                    nitrogen composition, particularly some of the size-fractionated                samples.  This variety of measurements should lead to a better                  understanding of the nature of these particles and their                        potential roles in marine biogeochemical cycles.",
