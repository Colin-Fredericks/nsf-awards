 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports visits over a two year period by Dr. Dale L.                Whalen of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County to the                   Laboratory of Dr. James M. Coxon, University of Canterbury, in                  Christchurch, New Zealand.  The Ministry of Research, Science and               Technology is supporting the reciprocal visits by Dr. Coxon to                  the U.S.  This collaborative research activity is designed to                   investigate Lewis acid-catalyzed rearrangement of substituted                   epoxides.  The project will attempt to determine the                            rearrangement pathways and the stereoselectivity of hydrogen                    migration in epoxides.                                                                                                                                          Semi-empirical and initial calculations will be performed by both               research groups.  Exchange visits are designed to facilitate                    formulation of the computational approach to profiling the                      rearrangement process.  By combining the talents of these                       complementary researchers, Whalen the experimentalist and Coxon                 the theoretician, a significant contribution in the field of                    organic chemical dynamics toward understanding the intermediate                 states in stereospecific epoxide rearrangements should occur.  At               present such rearrangement mechanisms are not well understood.",
