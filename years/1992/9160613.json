 "awd_abstract_narration": "Though radioactivity is widely used in bioassays due to its high                sensitivity and convenience, safety and environmental concerns                  have accelerated efforts to eliminate its use.  Several recent                  examples of procedures using luminescence have surpassed                        conventional isotopic methods.  Among these, luminescence of                    firefly luciferase is the most efficient known.  The                            investigators have completed significant new research advancing                 the knowledge of the enzymatic mechanism of firefly luciferase.                 The new chemistry provides greater luminescence intensity with                  simpler reaction kinetics.  To gain a broader perspective of                    properties of beetle luciferases and to develop enzymes better                  suited to commercial applications, the investigators propose to                 examine the structure and function of several divergent isozymes                by using cDNA clones already isolated coding for these isozymes.                Phase I will assess the feasibility of this proposal by                         expressing and purifying the cloned luciferases in E.coli                       developing methods for random mutagenesis, and initiating                       crystallization studies.  Phase II will focus on characterizing                 the recombinant luciferases, examining their relative structural                relationships, enhancing their properties by random mutagenesis,                and generating protein crystals of the new isozymes.  Phase III                 efforts will use the knowledge acquired on enzyme property                      enhancement to develop a number of bioassay-related and other                   commercial applications.",
