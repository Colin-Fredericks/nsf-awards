 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Psychology Department of Clark                 University to continue an REU Site project designed to build upon               and make more effective a formal curriculum known as the Research               Apprenticeship Program.  It is hoped that this program can become               a model for participatory undergraduate science education.  The                 training model features apprenticeship, hands-on, elbow teaching,               where students learn by actively participating in all phases of a               research study--ideally from problem formulation to data collection             and analysis to presentation at a professional meeting, manuscript              preparation and publication.  Students may work with one of 19                  Faculty Associates, whose interests collectively address                        biological, psychological, and sociocultural aspects of behavior                and represent the full spectrum of university-level scholarship in              psychology, from neuroanatomy to literary analysis, from work with              animals to studies of people in foreign cultures.  Specific                     features of the proposed project include (1) funding summer                     research, (2) scheduling University Conferences and Summer Seminars             to promote collegial scientific discourse with and among students,              (3) funding student paper presentations at professional meetings,               and community, particularly to women, blacks, and hispanics.  These             features support the principal goal of the REU program, to promote              careers in scientific research.",
