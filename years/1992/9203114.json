 "awd_abstract_narration": "Panicum miliaceum is a minor crop in the United States and                 Canada.  Around 1970, a black-grained biotype appeared as a weed                of row crops in the Midwest and in Canada.  At least six other                  crop-like biotypes are growing as weeds in row crops in Canada.                      The recent colonization of North America by the black                      biotype where it is frequently sympatric with crop and crop-like                weeds affords a unique opportunity to study evolution in the                    early stages after colonization.                                                     DNA molecular techniques are more sensitive to genetic                     variation than are either allozyme electrophoresis or                           morphological characters.  The Principal Investigator will use                  DNA molecular techniques in Barbara Schaal's lab in Washington                  University to assess genetic relationships among biotypes,                      measure genetic change in the black biotype as it has expanded                  its range, and search for introgression between various weed                    populations and crops.  This study will shed light on the role of               genetic variation among populations of successful colonizing                    species.                                                                             After this project, DNA molecular techniques will enhance                  the P.I.'s current research in population biology.  Molecular                   biology techniques will make the study of plant population                      biology more attractive to his undergraduate students for their                 independent research projects.",
