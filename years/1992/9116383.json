 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this US-Hungary research project                       under the Hungary Joint Fund between Dr. Antal Kiss,                            Institute of Biochemistry, Hungarian Academy of Sciences,                       and Dr. Richard Roberts, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, is                      to purify restriction endonucleases and modification                            methylases for enzymological and crystallographic studies.                                                                                                      Experiments are planned to identify the regions of these                        enzymes that are responsible for sequence specific DNA                          recognition.  This will involve the preparation of hybrid                       methylases and the isolation of specificity mutants, plus                       an extensive algorithmic analysis of the amino acid                             sequences of restriction endonucleases and of modification                      methylases.  The algorithms and programs developed would                        be used to detect, define and search sequence motifs of                         functionally related proteins.  These motifs could then                         help in interpreting new sequence data.  A database of                          motifs will be built and maintained.  The results of these                      studies will increase our understanding of how restriction                      endonucleases and DNA-methylases work.                                                                                                                          This project in molecular biology fulfills the program                          objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                      combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas                       of strong mutual interest and competence.",
