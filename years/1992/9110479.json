 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will center on integrating certain data from                 upper tropospheric aircraft, primarily the NASA DC-8, into the                  composite data set for the intensive observing array for TOGA-                  COARE (Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere; Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere               Response Experiment).  There is a great need for quantitative                   data on particle size distribution, temperature, moisture and                   wind data from the interior of the tropical cloud systems in                    COARE.  The contribution of these data will be maximized by close               coordination with the flight plans of the other aircraft, which                 will be obtaining simultaneous Doppler radar data.  The DC-8 will               be used first for quantitative description of the upper                         tropospheric characteristics of the COARE cloud clusters.  These                data sets will be used in combination with data from the COARE                  ship away and from the other aircraft to test the hypothesis that               small differences in convective updraft strength may be                         associated with profoundly different vertical profiles of                       hydrometeor content and particle size distribution.  If true,                   latent heating and radiative heating profiles would be greatly                  affected.  It will be important to place the findings in the                    context of the type of mesoscale convective system, and stage of                life cycle.  The results of this work will help provide \"ground                 truth\" for cloud models and radiative transfer models.  The                     research will also take advantage of the unprecedented                          opportunity presented by the active and passive microwave sensors               on the DC-8 operating within the intensive array of observations                from the other platforms.  The research includes interpreting the               passive microwave radiometer data from the DC-8 in terms of rain                rate and providing these rainfall estimates to the other COARE                  investigators.                                                                                                                                                       This research is important because it is one of the TOGA                   COARE studies of convective scale physical processes that can be                linked to larger scales that impact variability in an especially                climate sensitive region of the world, the western Pacific Ocean,               the field site of TOGA COARE.",
