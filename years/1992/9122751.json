 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                      Chemistry Division has provided support to Professor Zhang to                   use a novel computational method to conduct two studies in the                  general area of chemical dynamics:  (1) a study of dissociative                 adsorption and associative desorption of hydrogen on transition                 metals, and (2) an investigation of the rotational state                        distribution in the vibrational predissociation of the HF                       dimer.  The work involves massive computations made possible by                 a combination of recent advances in computer technology and a                   new time-dependent quantum wave packet method that has been                     developed by Professor Zhang.                                                   %%%                                                                             The breaking apart of molecules as they are adsorbed on a                       surface or their recombination as they leave the surface are                    two of the fundamental steps in catalytic processes.  In this                   research, Professor Zhang applies a new technique he has                        developed to make possible a more realistic study of such                       individual chemical steps than has previously been possible.                    The present work is limited to hydrogen as the adsorbing gas,                   but it will serve as a test of the new theoretical advances                     which may be applied to larger systems later as computer                        technology advances.  The same theoretical approach is also                     being used and further tested in a study of the energy                          distribution in the products when the hydrogen bond in the                      HF dimer is broken.",
