 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental studies on the characterization of impurities,                     particularly those that form deep levels, in II-VI and other                    semiconductors by advanced X-ray techniques are being conducted.                The principal goal of the research is to obtain a direct                        correlation of the luminescent properties of wide bandgap                       semiconductors and local concentration of specific impurities.                  Although remarkable results have recently been obtained for blue-               emitting laser heterjunction diodes based on ZnSe, the role of                  impurities in limiting the maximum carrier concentration of p-type              ZnSe is not understood, and it is expected that the results of this             research will be of significant benefit to the understanding and                improvement of II-VI materials, in general, as well as other                    semiconductors.                                                                 %%%                                                                             This research is expected to aid in finding solutions for several               problems and to contribute to the understanding of outstanding                  issues in II-VI materials related to impurities at low                          concentrations which adversely affect fundamental radiative                     processes determining the feasibility and efficiency of                         optoelectronic devices such as lasers and light emitting                        diodes(LED).  Understanding the fundamental nature of the influence             of ultra-low levels of impurities in these materials will                       contribute toward the realization of improved optoelectronic                    devices operating in the blue spectral region.",
