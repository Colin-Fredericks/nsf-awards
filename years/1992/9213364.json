 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project has two central objectives.  The first is to              observe, measure, and summarize the degree of change and continuity             of a number of the key attributes of the global political system                from the Congress of Vienna (1816) to the present day.  The second              is to ascertain the extent to which the postulated mix of change                and continuity is associated with fluctuations in the incidence of              international war.  More specifically, is war more frequent or                  severe prior to, during, or after periods of appreciable system                 change?  There are several schools of thought, none solidly                     substantiated by the evidence, but on the basis of some tentative               findings, historical recall, and deductive reasoning, the working               hypothesis in this study is that war tends to peak toward the close             of periods of relative stability in the system's basic                          configurations, but produces in its wake a rapid and dramatic set               of changes in the system.                                                                                                                                       To assess this, the major attributes of the political system                    (structural, cultural, and material) will be specified, measured,               and analyzed for direction and magnitude of change, singly and in               combination.  The frequency and severity of international war will              also be measured over time in an effort to ascertain the extent to              which war increases after periods of system constancy/rigidity and              thus precedes and helps account for major system change,  Thus,                 war, is seen largely as a precursor and catalyst of system change               rather than a consequence of such change.                                                                                                                       This research continues the Correlates of War project begun by the              Principal Investigator which examines the incidence of war from                 1816 to the present.",
