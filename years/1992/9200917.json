 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of electron spin resonance couplings of                        biradical species in a variety of different environments will                   be conducted.  Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance                    will be used to study the effects of substituents, geometrical                  constraints, distance, solvent, and temperature between the                     flexible organic biradicals.  Media to be included in the                       investigation include organic solvents, super critical fluids,                  vesicles, micelles, liquid crystals, polymers, and zeolites.                    The magnitude of the size of the coupling constants will                        provide critical information with respect to through solvent                    versus through bond interactions in weakly coupled systems.  In                 the case of the polymer systems, strategic placement of the                     biradical sites in the polymer chain will allow rotational                      barriers to be probed both at the end and at the center of the                  polymer.  In addition, polymers containing critical                             concentrations of ketones will be synthesized and investigated                  to define the parameters important in development of the next                   generation of photodegradable macromolecular materials.                         %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       investigation of biradical interactions in chemical systems by                  Professor Malcolm Forbes at the University of North Carolina at                 Chapel Hill.  It is critical to understand the method by which                  different parts of molecular systems communicate with each                      other electronically in order to be in a position to design                     molecules that are capable of performing specific functions in                  the context of a molecular device.  In addition, the synthesis                  of new materials with potential use as photodegradable plastics                 will be guided by the results of the biradical studies.  Also                   photochemically reactive polymers will be designed to increase                  the adhesion between traditionally non-interactive polymeric                    materials.",
