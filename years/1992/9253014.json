 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a one-year study, the research term proposed to study the                    kinetics of the oxidation--in the presence of UV light and TiO2--of             chlorinated phenols and substituted phenols which are two classes of            compounds that include 24 of the 129 priority pollutants listed by              EPA.  The intent is that the results will aid environmental                     engineers in the development of photocatalytic oxidation techniques             for water and wastewater treatment.                                                                                                                             Objectives of the proposal research are:                                                                                                                        1.    Photocatalytic oxidation kinetics or organics for three                         different classes, namely, chlorinated aromatics, substituted                   aromatics, competitive oxidation between them will be                           investigated.  A model compound in each organic class will be                   extensively studied for both adsorption and oxidation.  The                     oxidation kinetics will be mathematically modeled by Langmuir-                  Hinshelwood equation.  The kinetic parameters obtained will be                  used to estimate the oxidation parameters of other organics in                  the class according to molecular structure-reactivity                           relations at a given water quality.                                                                                                                       2.    The effects of water quality such as pH, dissolved oxygen,                      alkalinity, and hardness on the Hammett plot will be studied.                   The effect of temperature and light intensity will also be                      investigated for different classes of organic pollutants.                                                                                                 3.    When more than on substrate coexist in the solution, a                          competitive oxidation kinetics will be established.  A                          mathematic model will be constructed according to molecular                     parameters, water qualities, temperature, and light intensity                   to predict the oxidation rate for a given organic compound at                   a given water quality and organic mixture.                                                                                                                4.    Fundamental mechanisms such as hydroxyl radical attack and                      positive hole oxidation will be differentiated under different                  experimental conditions for different organic compounds                         through Hammett plots by using pH as the master variable.",
