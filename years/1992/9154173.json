 "awd_abstract_narration": "Participants are being recruited who share a common interest in                 exploring various areas of combinatories and discrete                           mathematics as they are applied to a variety of topics, many of                 which have direct applicability to the undergraduate                            curriculum.  The objective of this conference is to cover                       selected fundamental topics from contemporary                                   combinatories/discrete mathematics, with the goal of                            modernizing undergraduate courses related to these areas.  To                   this end, emphasis will be on basic new theoretical results and                 their uses, as well as fundamental combinatorial/discrete                       mathematics concepts and problem solving techniques.  The                       application of these topics to areas other than mathematics                     will also be discussed.  The mornings will be devoted to                        lectures by the main speakers and afternoons to group                           discussions, problem solving sessions, participant talks,                       classroom application/incorporation/improvements, and the use                   of computer facilities.  The participants will be required to                   submit a report indicating how the ideas of this conference                     were incorporated into or affected the content of their                         courses; the teaching of their courses; their mathematical                      activity and awareness; and, where applicable, their research                   during the 1992-93 school year.",
