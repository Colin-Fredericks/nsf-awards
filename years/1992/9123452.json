 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research proposed is to develop parallel sparse                system solvers for symmetric indefinite and non-symmetric linear                systems such as those occurring in computational fluid dynamics,                develop parallel techniques for solving time-dependent problems, and            construct a rapid prototyping environment for developing and                    experimenting with algorithms in sparse matrix computations on shared           and distributed memory multiprocessors.  In particular, the following           will be examined:                                                                                                                                                 o  parallel solution schemes for solving Stokes-like linear problems               arising in CFD and other augmented Lagrangian problems such as                  interior point methods of linear programming,                                                                                                                o  incomplete Newton methods with Krylov or row projection iterative               solvers for the inner iteration,                                                                                                                             o  solution of time-dependent problems using high-order parallel                   methods in time,                                                                                                                                             o  defining and developing sparse matrix primitives analogous to the               highly effective BLAS-3's for dense computations, and                                                                                                        o  implementing sparse factorization and solution schemes.                                                                                                    The goal is portable efficiency and scalability, by exploiting                  parallelism on multiple levels.  This in turn will allow the work to            be used across a wide spectrum of existing and future computer                  architectures, instead of simply a particular machine.",
