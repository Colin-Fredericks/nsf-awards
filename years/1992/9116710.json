 "awd_abstract_narration": "In terms of hardware capabilities, distributed/parallel computing is a          technical reality today.  With modern workstations and networking,              users can compute on workstations on remote compute servers, or even            on ensembles of computers, running compute-intensive kernels in                 parallel by exploiting idle CPU cycles on networks.  However,                   substantial knowledge about networking and parallel/distributed                 computing is required to achieve this.                                                                                                                          The goal of this SBIR Phase II project is to build a state-of-the-art           software package that will bring this immense potential power to the            user's own workstation, except they will run many times faster.  The            package will be based on CLAM(R), a powerful, interactive software              environment for computation and visualization, designed, developed and          marketed by Scientific Computing Associates, Inc.                                                                                                               The Phase I work proved the feasibility of seamlessly accessing local           external libraries and demonstrated CLAMshell(TM), a Mac-like user-             friendly front end for CLAM.  The phase II work will complete the               research on two approaches:  (1) parallelizing the compute intensive            kernals of CLAM's internal back end (2) enhancing CLAM's foreign                procedure interface to permit access to procedures which run on other           computers (including parallel supercomputers) or over a computer                network in a distributed/parallel fashion.",
