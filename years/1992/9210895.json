 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent population studies show that joint nuclear-cytoplasmic                   surveys allow unique inferences about many important evolutionary               processes.  This special utility derives from the fact that genes               in the nucleus are inherited through both parents, while an                     organism's cytoplasmically-housed genes, such as those in                       mitochondria and chloroplasts, are usually inherited solely through             the mother.  As a result of this asymmetrical transmission, a                   population's joint nuclear-cytoplasmic makeup can provide a new way             for detecting zones of genetic admixture between two populations,               and for unraveling the relative amounts of pollen and seed                      dispersion in plant populations.  The proposed research will                    develop the necessary theoretical framework for unlocking the novel             information encoded by nuclear-cytoplasmic data in these and other              important evolutionary contexts.  The practical utility of these                new approaches will be demonstrated by direct applications to a                 variety of recent data sets.  A parallel line of research will                  provide a conceptual framework for understanding the fundamental                question of how and why cytoplasmic inheritance patterns evolve                 through time.  This seminal theoretical study is motivated by the               growing number of cases in which mitochondria and chloroplasts are              inherited through the father or both parents, instead of solely                 through the mother.  Moreover, the pattern of inheritance may                   evolve through time under the control of nuclear or cytoplasmic                 genes within the parents or progeny.  These exciting experimental               discoveries will form the basis of an extensive series of models                designed to delimit the conditions favoring evolution among the                 three cytoplasmic inheritance patterns, and answer the critical and             intriguing question of why strict maternal transmission now seems               to predominate.",
