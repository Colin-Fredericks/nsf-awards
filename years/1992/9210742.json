 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves a comparative investigation of the effects               of campaign information on voting in elections for the U.S. House,              Senate, and Presidency.  More specifically, it will examine how                 differences in the information generated in these different                     elections, in combination with voter differences in partisan values             and in political attentiveness, account for differences in both                 individual-level voting patterns and aggregate level election                   outcomes.                                                                                                                                                       The central theoretical idea is that voters who are more attentive              to politics are more heavily exposed to campaign information, but               that different voters encounter different campaign messages,                    depending on the relative intensity of the opposing campaigns.  The             major purpose of the project is to investigate the effects of                   differences in campaign intensity across and within different types             of elections.  The researchers are particularly interested in the               effects of differences in information flow between campaign and                 non-campaign periods, the effects of changes over the past 40 years             in the amount of information reaching voters, and the effects of                different kinds of information on different kinds of voters.  The               researchers expect to be able to accommodate these various effects              within a framework that explicitly models the diffusion of two                  competing and highly variable information flows (one for each                   candidate) through an electorate in which voters vary greatly in                their political values and political attentiveness.                                                                                                             The project, based on National Election Studies data, develops                  models of how changes in the flow of campaign information from 1952             to the present have affected different types of voters and                      elections.",
