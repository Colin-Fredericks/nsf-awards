 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the indole alkaloid ajmalicine, obtained from                          Catharanthus roseus, is not an important product in the                         U.S., it serves as a useful model for the development of                        an \"enabling technology\" for the efficient production of                        potentially more important compounds, such as taxol.                            Previous work has shown that combining four treatment                           strategies can result in a 50-fold increase in the                              extracellular production of ajmalicine.  These four                             strategies are:  (1) elicitation; (2)  production medium                        development; (3)  calcium alginate immobilization; and (4)                      in situ adsorption with XAD-7 resin.  They interacted                           synergistically, and were accomplished in batch reactors.                       Attempts with repeated batch cultivation revealed                               difficulties in sustaining a high level of production.                          This work seeks to answer the following questions:  (1)                         what factors cause the loss of productivity and                                 alterations in cell physiology during prolonged culture;                        and (2) is continuous high-level production using the                           combined four strategies possible?",
