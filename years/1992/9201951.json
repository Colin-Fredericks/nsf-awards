 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators introduce new mathematically rigorous                    experiments to compute dynamical entities of chaotic systems, and               they consider the rigorous reliability of commonly used                         algorithms.  In particular, they construct suitable algorithms to               compute orbits of chaotic ordinary differential equations, such                 as the Lorenz equations, and derive rigorous estimates of the                   shadowing error in such numerically computed orbits; determine                  general conditions under which an attractor of a differential                   equation is well-approximated by an attractor of the discretized                system resulting from a one-step method; and devise a rigorous                  numerical algorithm to test for hyperbolicity in specific                       dynamical systems.  They also study homoclinic phenomena, which                 play an essential role in the analysis of chaotic behavior.  More               specifically, they estimate the intervals of the parameter on a                 dense subset of which a one-parameter family of dissipative                     planar diffeomorphisms has homoclinic tangencies, and establish                 the presence of transversal homoclinic points in slowly varying                 systems.                                                                             Some of the more noteworthy discoveries in dynamical systems               have largely been based on numerical experiments.  It is                        important to devise such experiments whose reliability can be                   rigorously verified.  Most of this project is concerned with                    chaotic systems.  In recent years it has been realized that much                of nature behaves chaotically.  For example, small changes on a                 given day in weather parameters such as temperature and                         barometric pressure can lead to large fluctuations in weather                   patterns a few days later.  A mathematical model that describes a               chaotic system in nature will almost inevitably behave                          chaotically also.  Because these mathematical models can rarely                 be solved exactly, knowledge of their behavior relies greatly on                computer simulations.  The main object of this project is to                    develop tests that will tell how close a computer simulation of a               chaotic system is to a true behavior of the system.",
