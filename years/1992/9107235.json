 "awd_abstract_narration": "Determining genetic relationships among the various kinds of               advanced snakes is a most difficult and challenging problem.  The               greatly simplified body plan of snakes offers few anatomical                    characters that can be used to distinguish among them, and in many              cases two or more species have developed the same sets of                       anatomical characteristics independently.  The past reliance on                 anatomical characteristics has, therefore, provided little in the               way of reliable information about snake relationships.  To rectify              this, it is proposed that the DNA sequences of two mitochondrial                genes be obtained from representatives of the eight largest                     presumptive groups of advanced snakes and, for comparative                      purposes, from two primitive snake groups.  DNA sequence                        comparisons offer two huge advantages over anatomical comparisons               for these studies.  One is that the reduction in anatomical                     complexity is not reflected at the DNA level; the full range of DNA             sequence complexity is present for use in determining                           relationships.  The other is that, unlike the case with many                    anatomical changes, there is almost no possibility that the same                sequence changes will occur independently in two different species;             thus, with functional convergences from those due to genealogical               inheritance.                                                                         An accurate knowledge of the genetic relationships among                   advanced snakes is required for understanding the ways in which                 suites of characteristics develop.  For example, knowing exactly                how non-poisonous and poisonous snakes are related will resolve                 some of the controversies that presently surround the development               of venom glands and the anatomical components for delivering venom.             This knowledge will also provide the foundation for future studies              of relationships among snake groups not examined here.",
