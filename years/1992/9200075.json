 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project                 is in the field of chemistry.  Beginning in 1992, twelve                        undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer engaged                 in basic research under the direction of the faculty members in                 the Chemistry Department.  The focus of the REU project is to                   stimulate an increase in the number of students pursuing                        research-oriented careers in science, by reaching out to new                    populations of students, both outside and inside the                            University, to provide the benefits of undergraduate research                   experience, to inform students of the potential that chemistry                  holds as a career, and to aid in their realization of full                      scientific potential.  The program includes ten weeks of                        research, academic credit, a seminar series, housing, travel                    funds and social activities.  The research projects of the                      fourteen participating faculty span a wide range that includes                  organic and inorganic synthesis, kinetic and mechanistic                        studies, computational chemistry, analytical instrument design,                 environmental analytical chemistry, crystallization methods,                    solid-state chemistry, and electrochemistry.",
