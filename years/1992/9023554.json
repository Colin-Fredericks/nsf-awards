 "awd_abstract_narration": "This faculty award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made              to Dr. Suzan Edwards of the Five College Astronomy Department at                Smith College.                                                                                                                                                       The NSF Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers                   recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in teaching                 and scholarship as well as the potential for continued significant              contributions to scientific research, the academic profession, and              the education of future scientists.                                                                                                                                  Dr. Edwards will carry out research on energetic winds and                 disk accretion in low mass young stars.  Current observational and              theoretical work on star formation suggests that the gravitational              collapse of dense, rotating cores in molecular clouds results in                an initial configuration of a protostar which is dominated by a                 flattened spinning disk of roughly solar system dimension.  During              the first hundred thousand years, the simultaneous processes of                 mass infall onto the outer part of the disk and accretion of                    material through the disk and onto the central stellar object are               hidden from direct view by the opaque screen provided by dust in                the infalling remnant core material.  Very early in this process,               however, observations show that the protostellar system turns on                an energetic bipolar wind.  While the driving mechanism for this                wind is not yet understood, theoretical arguments suggest that such             a wind is required in order for the central object to shed                      sufficient angular momentum to grow to stellar dimensions.                                                                                                           After several hundred thousand years, the energetic wind has               removed enough of the remnant infalling core material that the                  star/energetic wind/accretion disk system becomes optically                     revealed as a T Tauri \"star\".  A high resolution optical                        spectroscopic survey of T Tauri systems will be carried out at the              4m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in a double-pronged              study to investigate atomic lines formed in two distinct regions.               Data from Observations of spectral lines formed in the energetic                winds will be used to probe the wind origin and collimation                     mechanism, and to better constrain wind mass loss rates.                        Observations of lines formed in regions where mass accretion onto               the stellar surface is occurring will be used to determine whether              mass transfer from disk to star is conducted through a classical                equatorial boundary layer or whether the stellar magnetic field                 interrupts the disk and channels disk material along field lines                to the stellar surface.",
