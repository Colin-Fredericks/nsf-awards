 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, of $390,000, is for support of a Center for Education               Research  Infrastructure Development in Microelectromechanical                  Systems.  The mission of the center is to develop model                         interdisciplinary educational programs and resources in                         microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) which interact  with and                  support a coordinated and focused MEMS research program.  The core              of the proposed program is a team of four faculty members from                  Materials Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical                       Engineering, whose interests and expertise span most of MEMS                    technology. The educational efforts include course development,                 project/research involvement of graduate and undergradaute                      students, seminars, and interaction and outreach to industry and                other educational institutions.  The research component of the                  program consists of several projects which are focused on the                   common goal of developing an integrated MEMS technology in which                all major elements (microactuators, microsensors, micromechanical               devices, and on-chip electronics) can be compatibly fabricated on               a common substrate.",
