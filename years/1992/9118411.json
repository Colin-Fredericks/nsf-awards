 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objectives of this proposed research are to continue               basic investigations into the mechanism of signal-coupling during               the initiation of endocytosis in Amoeba proteus and to provide some             undergraduate students with a realistic research experience.                    Endocytosis is a fundamental process which involves the uptake of               material external to a cell by surface membrane infolding and                   vesiculation.  Previous work from this laboratory examined the                  interaction of signal molecules with the cell surface and                       identified several possible components of the signal pathway                    associated with the onset of endocytosis.  These include a G-                   protein, cyclic AMP and calcium.  A G-protein in the amoeba                     membrane was identified by ADP-ribosylation of a membrane                       protein(s) in the presence of cholera and pertussis toxin.                      Initiation of both phagocytosis and pinocytosis elicit rapid                    transient oscillations in cytoplasmic cAMP levels and cytoplasmic               Ca increases transiently in stimulated cells.                                                                                                                   This proposal will attempt to further characterizethe components                of the signal pathway and try to differentiate between the signal               processes occurring during both pinocytosis and phagocytosis.  The              ameba represents a particularly useful model system in the study                of endocytosis and it is expected that this study will increase our             insight into the mechanism of endocytosis in this and other                     systems.",
