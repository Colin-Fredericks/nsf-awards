 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concurrent engineering strives to perform design activities                simultaneously, rather than in series as in the case of traditional             design.  This may result in reduction of the duration of the design             project, cost savings, and better quality of the final design.  The             concurrent strategy, however, might increase the complexity of the              design process and make it more difficult to manage.  The aim of                this research is to develop a methodology for management of the                 design process in a concurrent engineering environment.                              The methodology includes the development of a prototype system             that will decompose and simplify the design process and reduce the              computational time of product development.  Information flow and                organizational characteristics of complex design projects will also             be analyzed.  The system includes a multi-agent architecture to                 model the concurrent engineering environment, a negotiation model               for conflict resolution and a module to integrate product                       modularity concepts with the management of design changes.",
