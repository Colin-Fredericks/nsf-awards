 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular genetics will be used to investigate how complex                      biological structures are constructed in the fruit fly, Drosophila              melanogaster.  The development of Drosophila proceeds via a                     hierarchy of gene expression which, in its early stages, generates              segmented embryo.  Following segmentation, each metamere develops               a particular identity due to the action of the homeotic selector                genes.  The products of these genes all contain the DNA-binding                 homeodomain and probably function by transcriptionally regulating               a set of target genes.  To understand how homeotic selector genes               specify particular metameric identities it is important to isolate              and study these target genes.  They will be isolated by using a                 subtractive hybridization procedure designed to identify                        differences in gene expression between animals that overexpress a               particular homeotic selector gene (Ultrabithorax, Ubx) and animals              that underexpress this gene.  Once isolated, we will rank our                   interest in these genes by answering the following questions:  Do               their patterns of expression correlate with Ubx expression in wild              type animals?  Do their patterns of expression change in animals                mutant for homeotic selector genes (including, but not limited to,              Ubx mutations)?  And, do any of these genes map to positions in the             genome where Ubx proteins bind or to where known homeotic loci are              located?  We will focus on those genes that fulfill most of these               criteria.  They will be further characterized both molecularly and              genetically to determine how they function during development to                generate metameric identities.***//",
