 "awd_abstract_narration": "McKee has been awarded a grant to continue his studies of the              interaction between diurnally varying up- and down-valley winds and             the overlying synoptic-scale flow. These are separated by an                    intermediate layer between valley top and mountain top. Its dynamic             state  determines the degree of coupling between these two circula-             tion systems. This coupling is poorly understood. In the  past,                 difficultys in observing this layer impeded the development of                  adequate theoretical treatments of the important complex of                     processes occurring there. McKee hypothesizes that in the western               U.S. orogenic (mountain) blocking, in which the lower air is                    prevented from flowing over the mountain tops, is the primary                   phenomenon controlling this layer. He plans to use recently                     developed observational systems in a field program during the first             grant year, and subsequently to use the field measurements in                   conjunction with the CSU-RAMS numerical model to investigate the                evolution and duration of mountain blocking. The study is intended              to confirm or reject the hypothesis that areas west of the                      Continental Divide are blocked for extended periods during the                  winter, to define the length of the primary season for blocking,                and to provide increased understanding of the nature of the                     phenomenon.                                                                                                                                                          Orogenic blocking is likely to be important for climate                    because of its effects on vertical heat and moisture transports,                and on the effective drag on overlying large scale circulations                 exerted by complex terrain at their lower boundary. It also has                 many important practical consequences  in terms of local                        meteorology (e.g. air quality and valley winds).",
