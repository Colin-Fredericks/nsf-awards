 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Steven Brandt will conduct archaeological survey and                        excavation in the Gamu-Gofa Highlands region of Southwestern                    Ethiopia.  His goal is to understand how ensete (Ensete                         ventricosum) or \"false banana\" was domesticated and incorporated                into Ethiopian subsistence practices.  He will conduct two months               of fieldwork in this area which is both archaeologically unknown                and in the heart of the present region of ensete use.  He will                  locate promising areas on the basis of both local interview and                 analysis of areal photographs and satellite imagery.  In                        particular, he will focus on caves and rock shelters because the                potential for locating stratified deposits is greatest there.                   Limited test excavations will be conducted and a basic cultural                 sequence established.  With this data it will then be possible to               plan longer term field research.                                                                                                                                While the archaeology of the Ethiopian highlands is poorly known,               modern botanic data suggest that this region served as point of                 origin for many widely used African domesticates.  Ensete is a                  large, fibrous, tree-like monocot which closely resembles a                     banana.  Unlike the banana, however, the fruits are inedible and                the main sources of food are the roots, pseudo-stems and left-                  stems.  Although wild species of ensete are distributed                         throughout much of central, eastern and southern Africa,                        evidently it is only in Ethiopia that domesticated varieties are                cultivated. Ensete is either baked or made into porridge and is                 eaten by about one fifth of Ethiopia's estimated 10,000,000                     people. Various parts of the plant are also used for fodder, fuel               and packing material.  Almost nothing is known about the                        development of ensente use and Dr. Brandt's research should                     provide needed basic data.                                                                                                                                      This project is important for several reasons.  It will provide                 insight into the processes which led to the original                            domestication of plants and animals.  Ethiopia is prone to                      drought and human starvation and hopefully greater understanding                of indigenous farming techniques which have stood the test of                   time) may provide new ways to attack this problem.  This short-                 term exploratory project should lay the groundwork to later more                intensive research.",
