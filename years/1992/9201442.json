Purpose of the conference is to review and evaluate (1)                         contemporary methods for measuring and describing spatial                       variations in economic growth, social development, and                          environmental quality; (2) the effectiveness of prevailing                      development and settlement theories in accounting for such                      spatial variations; and (3) ways the state intervenes to reduce                 spatial inequalities, why it intervenes as it does, and the                     extent that policies programs achieve intended results.                                                                                                         Topics of special interest include housing provision, educational               opportunity, health care, income maintenance, women's issues,                   general regional economic development, and environmental                        protection.  This seminar is jointly supported by NSF and the                   Korean Science and Engineering Foundation.",
