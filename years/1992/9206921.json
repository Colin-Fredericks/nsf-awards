 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, the human osteology                   collection at the Peabody Museum, Harvard University, has been                  reorganized and stored in individual containers which both                      protect the specimens and make them readily available to                        researchers. Work has also been done on the supporting                          documentation which places these materials into a meaningful                    archaeological context. In this final stage of the work, the                    Peabody team will continue the computerization of the materials                 to make the data base readily accessible.                                                                                                                       This osteology collection is one of the largest and most                        important such systematic collections in the United States. It                  consists of over 15,000 individuals from well documented                        archaeological, medical and forensic investigations. These                      collections form a broad comparative resource for cross cultural                research in physical anthropology. The materials are widely used                by researchers and in scientific demand. Unfortunately lack of                  organized documentation makes them difficult to use and places an               often unacceptable burden in terms of time on the researcher.                   This project will alleviate the situation.                                                                                                                      This project is important for several reasons. It will improve                  access to an important body of scientific data. It will also                    facilitate research which helps to explain human biological                     adaptation to varying environmental and cultural environments.",
