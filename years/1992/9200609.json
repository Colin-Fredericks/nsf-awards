 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fialkow will continue his study of several problems                        concerning systems of bounded linear operators on Hilbert space.                These problems concern the following topics: joint hyponormality                and related problems in the theory of moments; spectral theory of               elementary operators; and majorization, factorization and                       invertible factor theorems in C*-algebras.  One part of the                     research will concern structural models for subnormal, k-                       hyponormal, and weakly k-hyponormal operators, with an emphasis                 on unilateral weighted shifts; this study will also concern                     multidimensional power moment problems.                                              Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the               infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,               when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has                the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                   matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                  operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                    associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                      underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,               and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.",
