 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop the methodology for using               model-tracing tutors to deliver useable classroom instruction.  The             context of this effort will be to develop an Algebra I tutor that               will be used in the Pittsburgh Public Schools.  As the consequence              of past NSF support we have developed a software system for                     building such tutors, had extensive experience with building tutors             for algebra, and have an established research laboratory in the                 schools.  This grant will explore how this can be used to deliver               a Algebra I tutor that will be used in the schools.  We will try to             adapt the expert system development methodology for tutor                       development.  Our experts will be a master teacher in the school                system and the mathematics faculty in a local high school.  We will             work with them on codifying the curriculum (consistent with the                 standards of the NCTM) that they want to to teach and on making the             classroom adjustments to profitably employ the tutor.  This project             will serve as a general test of our tutoring methodology and serve              as a model for adapting it for other school systems and for other               topics.",
