 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lowell Observatory astronomers will collaborate with                            educators, museum specialists, and planetarium professional                     to design and implement a unique series of interactive                          science education exhibits entitled Tools of the Astronomer.                    The exhibits will capitalize on widespread interest in                          astronomy to illustrate the research process, demonstrate                       the theory and function of basic astronomical instruments,                      and encourage visitors to discover how measurements made                        with these instruments reveal the properties of celestial                       objects.                                                                                                                                                        Exhibit concepts developed by the Lowell staff will be                          evaluated by a National Exhibit Advisory Board (NEAB).  The                     original concepts will then be modified to reflect the                          Board's recommendations, and prototype exhibits will be                         built.  The prototypes will be extensively tested for                           durability and effectiveness in achieving the educational                       goals.  Students and teachers from Arizona (including those                     from nearby Navajo and Hopi Indian Reservations), plus                          members of the general public, will participate in the                          testing.  The NEAB will then review the completed prototypes                    and test results, and recommend any further modification or                     testing needed prior to selection of a professional exhibit                     fabricator to build the final exhibits.                                                                                                                         The completed exhibits will be installed and further                            evaluated in a new educational facility to be opened at                         Lowell Observatory in spring of 1994.  There, the exhibits                      will be experienced by tens of thousands of people who visit                    Lowell Observatory each year.  A significant fraction of                        these visitors will be school children who will participate                     in instructional programs designed around the exhibits.  The                    exhibits also will ultimately be used in teacher workshops.                     To achieve maximum impact, all software, exhibit designs,                       teacher's guides, and other material developed in this                          project will be marketed to schools, science centers,                           planetaria, observatories, and other educational entities at                    the cost of reproduction.",
