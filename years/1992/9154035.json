 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to develop and evaluate a                              sustainable university/school/industry program that models                      new methodologies for preparing elementary teachers to teach                    science effectively in a multicultural/urban setting. Over                      six semesters, 150 Towson State University (TSU) elementary                     education majors will be trained to teach, and subsequently                     teach, hands-on, integrated, sequential science units to                        small groups of children in grades 1-5.  The field component                    is to be located in 2 Baltimore City Public Schools (BCPS)                      having 90+% minority enrollment.  These supervised                              preservice experiences, as well as inservice training for                       participating classroom teachers, will be coordinated by a                      site-based director and guided by a  multidisciplinary                          advisory board.  The infrastructure needed to support this                      project will be built in three stages; 1) partnership                           planning; 2) model training; and 3) self-sufficiency                            development.  Master teachers, 2 from each of the 2 schools,                    will be selected from  a cadre of 20 teachers in the 2 BCPS                     schools.  These master teachers will be trained to                              coordinate the school-site tasks necessary to implement the                     program.  By 1994 the urban practicum will be a co-requisite                    of the science content/methods course in the TSU program.                                                                                                       In addition to NSF funding, this project is supported (28%)                     by Towson State University, the Baltimore City Public                           Schools, and Baltimore Gas and Electric.",
