 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ice cover in the Arctic Ocean plays an important role in                    the global climate by controlling exchange of momentum and heat                 between the atmosphere and the ocean.  Ice distribution defines                 not only the heat balance but it also influences the oceanic                    density distribution through the brine rejection during the cold                season, and ice melting during the warm season.  The strong                     processes of exchanging moisture and heat between atmosphere and                water occur at the pack-ice openings.  This project is part of a                systematic study of the Arctic environment and its role in global               change which is promoted by NSF's Arctic System Science Program.                It is a two year project to utilize data sets existing in the                   Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia                 with existing and refined models of increased sensitivity to                    evaluate the effect of tides on ice production and ice-ocean                    interaction.  This research will investigate four basic tidal                   constituents, with space resolution of about 20 kilometers, and                 the role of tides in sea-ice lead formation.",
