 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shragowitz         In this research fuzzy logic is being applied to reasoning  about problems of VLSI physical design and printed circuit boards  (PCB).  This includes identification of important factors for  each problem, selection of linguistic variables, formulation of  the membership functions for linguistic values in fuzzy sets and  formulation of the decision rules.  A fuzzy logic model of  timing-driven placement, where area, timing, and routability may  become conflicting goals is being developed.  This model  incorporates timing analysis and prediction, especially pre-  layout prediction of path and net criticality, and weight  functions for nets in computation of timing bounds.  A second  fuzzy logic model for placement of cells on a VLSI chip in the  presence of conflicting goals is being developed.  The model is  being adapted to PCB placement, taking into account parameters  such as connectivity, timing, transmission line effects,  routability, and thermal impact.    Experiments with the  algorithms on benchmark circuits are being performed.",
