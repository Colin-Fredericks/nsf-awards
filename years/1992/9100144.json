The                                               principal obstacle to advancing this                                            technology to full color video                                                  imaging is the need for a high                                                  brightness, saturated-blue phosphor.                                                                                                                            The objective of Phase I was to show                                            that bright blue EL phosphor can be                                             produced from chemical vapor                                                    deposited (CVD) zinc sulfide.  Ion                                              implantation was used to introduce                                              many different activator elements                                               into ZnS substrates.  Blue                                                      photoluminescence was found from Tm-                                            implanted ZnS; however, a                                                       combination of other ion implanted                                              elements gave much stronger                                                     luminescence and a deep blue color.                                             Rutherford backscattering analysis                                              and X-ray diffraction indicate that                                             ion implanted CVD thin films of ZnS                                             have favorable stoichiometry and                                                structure for TFEL devices, which                                               will be fabricated and tested in                                                Phase II.                                                                                                                                                       Spire proposes for Phase II to                                                  continue investigation of ion                                                   implanted blue electroluminescent                                               phosphors.  TFEL structures will be                                             fabricated from CVD-grown ZnS thin                                              films, implanted with the new blue-                                             emitting dopants and co-dopants,                                                implanted with control activators                                               such as Mn and Tm, and evaluated for                                            EL brightness, chromaticity and                                                 persistence.  Some optimization of                                              process and device fabrication                                                  parameters will be conducted.                                                                                                                                   Ion implanted TFEL devices have                                                 enormous potential for low-cost                                                 three-color displays because all                                                phosphor colors can be formed in the                                            same thin film substrate.",
