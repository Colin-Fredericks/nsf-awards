 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will critically analyze how the concept of                         sustainability functions as a norm in three settings:  within                   disciplines, as a social goal, and in setting agricultural and                  development policy.  The project is a multidisciplinary effort                  involving a philosopher, a soil scientist, and an anthropologist.               The disciplinary orientations of agronomy and archeology will                   provide contrasting scientific approaches to the study of                       sustainability.  Examining how these two disciplines compare and                contrast in their approaches to the concept of sustainability                   will provide a basis for understanding how sustainability                       functions as a norm in disciplinary contexts.  The principal                    investigator will review events of the past decade to examine how               sustainability has emerged as a political norm nationally and                   internationally.  The three collaborators will work together to                 develop a strategy for integrating and constructing an approach                 to sustainability that takes cognizance of both scientific and                  political norms, and which uses ethical goals as a way of                       bridging disciplinary divisions that emerge with respect to                     sustainability.  They will compare alternative interpretations of               sustainability as a norm for research policy decision making, and               analyze how these norms are influenced by disciplinary                          interpretations and what social goals the research policy norms                 are likely to achieve.  Project results will be disseminated                    through books, articles, and presentations at professional                      associations and relevant meetings.",
