 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally, the ear region is the preeminent source of                  comparative morphological information for evolutionary studies on               mammals.  It also presents one of the most oft cited examples of                evolutionary change in Biology textbooks: the evolution of the                  three middle-ear bones (ossicles) of mammals from the lower jaws                of more primitive forms. Despite its preeminence, knowledge of the              ear region remains incomplete.  During recent years, remarkable                 fossil finds have dramatically increased what is known of the ear               and its ossicles in extinct mammals and raised questions about                  previous views on the evolution of this region and of mammals in                general.  To fully evaluate these fossils and new evolutionary                  questions, it is necessary to increase comparative knowledge of the             ear in modern mammals, both in numbers and in level of detail.                  This research gathers comparative information on the embryology of              the ear region in modern mammals to evaluate the evolution of this              complex system and its role in the evolutionary history of mammals.",
