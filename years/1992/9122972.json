Ms. Snyder,                in her doctoral research under the direction of Professor                       Rosemary Stevens, is examining the origins of national government               involvement in the effort to control air-borne pollutants.                                                                                                      This project comprises the review of papers in Cincinnati, Ohio                 and University Park, Pennsylvania, of records of the State of                   Pennsylvania in Harrisburg, and the recording of oral histories                 with retired steelworkers and their spouses in Fort Myers,                      Florida.  This research promises to contribute to a social                      historical dissertation on the emergence of a federal approach to               air pollution after World War II, a policy crafted by research                  physicians and industrial hygienists informally, by means of                    expertise.  Ms. Snyder's dissertation focuses on responses to a                 premier environmental disaster of the pre-regulatory era, the                   deadly smog over the southwestern Pennsylvania steel towns of                   Donora and Webster in 1948.  Oral histories with surviving                      community members and leaders supply critical perspectives on                   local attitudes towards and experiences with outside                            investigators.  Review of the papers of Cincinnati's Dr. Robert                 Kehoe, who led the steel industry's investigation of the smog,                  provide an unprecedented view of the evolution of privately-                    sponsored environmental health expertise.  Review of United                     Steelworkers Secretary David J. McDonald's papers, and those of                 the Pennsylvania State Departments of Health and Labor and                      Industry, contribute key information about the tensions between                 industrial union, state, and federal government and                             administrative responsibilities for public health were                          renegotiated in the postwar era.",
