 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will determine the optimal conditions, the active                 subcellular fraction(s), and whether and elongation of chain-                   shortening pathway is responsible for biosynthesis of medium chain-             length methylketones and 2-alkanyl acetates in Drosophila.  The                 specificity of key enzymes at branch points in the pathways are                 determined using a series of radiolabeled and heavy-atom labeled                specific saturated and unsaturated putative precursors.  The                    possibility exists that intermediates in the biosynthesis pathway               are identified during the investigation giving additional detail to             the pathway.  The results are critical to subsequent isolation and              further characterization of the enzymes involved in the unique                  steps of biosynthesis of these methylketones and 2-alkanyl                      acetates.  Appropriate assays for each enzyme in the pathway will               allow for investigations of potentially conserved pathways in other             insects and plants, potential regulation, molecular biology and                 subsequent genetic analysis of medium chain-length methylketone and             2-alkanyl acetate biosynthesis.                                                 %%%                                                                             This research will elucidate steps in the synthetic pathways of                 insect pheromones and allomones, compounds that are vital in insect             communications.  Four species of fruit flies will be used as model              systems.  These communication compounds have proven useful in                   integrated pest management.  Understanding their synthesis may lead             to the development of additional insect control strategies.",
