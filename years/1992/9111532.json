 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Unification\" has been a paramount goal of science from its very                beginnings.  Thales proclaimed \"All is water.\"  Contemporary                    science continues this pursuit of unification.  Maxwell, in the                 19th century, unified the forces of electricity and magnetism and               showed that light is but an electro-magnetic phenomenon.                        Einstein's final efforts were to find a grand unification theory                of all forces.  Indeed this effort continues in current physics as              scientists try to complete the unification of the forces acting at              the atomic level: the electro-magnetic, strong, weak and                        gravitational forces.                                                                                                                                           While one can point to Thales and the other pre-Socratic                        philosophers as the first to attempt \"unification\" in science, the              practical efforts at unification in science did not begin until the             Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th Centuries.  This effort              culminated in Newton's theory of universal gravitation uniting the              force that governed the motion of celestial bodies with the force               that makes heavy bodies fall on Earth.  That Newton was successful              in this effort was due, in large respect, to the work of Johannes               Kepler in determining the laws by which planets circle the sun.                 Under this grant, Professors Peter Barker and Bernard Goldstein                 are examining Kepler's unification of astronomy and physics, and                his contribution to the norms of modern science, in the context of              16th century work on astronomy and astrology, rhetoric, and                     religious thought.  They are studying the availability and use of               these disciplines in books, letters, notes, and student theses by               Kepler and his contemporaries.  This setting illuminates Kepler's               presentation of Ptolemy, Copernicus and Brahe, and his innovations              in the content and methods of science.   They present the                       development of Kepler's ideas from the Mysterium Cosmographicum of              1596 through the  Apologia pro Tychone contra Ursum of 1600 and the             De Fundamentis Astrologiae Certioribus of 1602 to the Astronomia                Nova of 1609.  Their examination of the context of Kepler's work                draws on the expertise of an international group of consultants.                This study will be the first presentation of Kepler's unification               of physics and astronomy in its 16th century context, treating the              portion of his work from 1596 to 1609 as a whole.  In addition to               yielding new knowledge about a major figure and a key episode, the              project's contextual approach will establish links from the history             of science to wider fields of Renaissance and Reformation studies,              especially history, philosophy, rhetoric and religious thought.                 This study of Kepler's role in the development of the modern                    scientific methodology will also contribute to our understanding                of the historical process by which science differentiated itself                from the humanities and theology.",
