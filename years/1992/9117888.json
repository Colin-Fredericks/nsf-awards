 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrogen is an essential element for growth of a living cell and it             has been shown that nitrogen availability controls both the                     mitotoic and meiotic cell cycles in the yeast, Saccharomyces                    cerevisae.  A novel class of yeast mutants (aat1-3) has been                    isolated which have a range of growth phenotypes (inability to grow             on rich media, sensitivity to amino acid analogs, heat shock                    sensitivity) that are only evident when the cell also requires a                particular amino acid for growth; prototrophic strains containing               an aat mutation grow normally.  Amino acid transport is                         misregulated in these  strains and there is genetic evidence for a              close relationship between Aat proteins and the products of the                 growth controls (RAS /cAMP) pathway.  A complete genetic analysis               of these mutants is proposed to elucidate their function in the                 control of amino acid transport and to establish if the Aat                     proteins have a role in the control of cell growth and division by              nutrients availability.",
