 "awd_abstract_narration": "In vivo and in vitro investigations are proposed on non-B DNA                   structures including intramolecular triplexes and other non-B                   right-handed conformations at oligopurine.oligopyrimidine tracts.               Studies will be conducted on naturally occurring pur.pyr sequences              to attempt to establish biological functions in prokaryotic and                 eukaryotic cells.  Also, systems will be investigated where                     synthetic pur.pyr tracts are cloned specifically at certain loci to             attempt to elucidate biochemical behaviors.  Biological systems                 include replication and transcription.  Direct determinations will              be established to evaluate the existence and properties in vivo of              non-B DNA oligopurine.oligopyrimidine structures in plasmids and                chromosomes.  Several probes will be utilized including UV                      photofootprinting, KMnO4, and methylase expression systems.                                                                                                     In vitro emphases include:  elucidation of other types (non-                    triplex) of non-B DNA structures at pur.pyr tracts; conditions which            stabilize these structures and their mechanisms of formation;                   enzymes (such as methylases, restriction enzymes) as conformational             probes; the effect of flanking sequences on thermodynamics,                     kinetics, and structures; the effect of methylation of C residues;              and the isolation and characterization of proteins that                         specifically bind these non-B conformations.                                                                                                                    These studies should provide significant insight into the                       biological and chemical properties of pur.pyr tracts which are found            in a variety of biologically important systems.",
