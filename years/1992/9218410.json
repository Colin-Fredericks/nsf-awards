Holyoke College.             This sabbatical will be to perform a research project at (CUMIRP).              Dr. Browne will be conducting research on the enzymatic processes               involved in polymer formation in the granules of bacteria, in                   collaboration with Dr. Robert W. Lenz and attending graduate                    polymer courses.  Dr. Browne plans to teach a polymer course at Mt.             Holyoke College which will be based on the material that she learns             while on sabbatical at the University of Massachusetts.  This                   course will become a regular advanced course in the Chemistry                   Department at Mt. Holyoke for chemistry majors.  In addition, Dr.               Browne, who is part Cherokee Indian, will make a number of trips to             visit Cherokee tribes in North Carolina and Oklahoma to establish               a program to recruit American Indians into science and hopefully                into chemistry.                                                                      The Program Director recommends that the University of                     Massachusetts, Amherst be awarded $64,000 for two years for support             of sabbatical for Dr. Sheila Browne.",
