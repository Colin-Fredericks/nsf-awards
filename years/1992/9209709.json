 "awd_abstract_narration": "Designed experiments in the social and behavioral sciences                 (and other fields as well) customarily are handled by techniques                associated with the analysis of variance (ANOVA).  When the data                may not be well behaved,  applied statisticians and other                       practitioners should be able to obtain robust estimates of                      individual effects,  accompanied by suitable summaries and                      aggregate measures of variability.  By adding substantially to                  the limited number of available small-sample results that apply                 to the summaries and aggregates required for robust ANOVA,  this                project aims to provide the basis (including critical tables) for               a unified body of basic inferential techniques for one-way and                  two-way layouts.                                                                     For data that fail to satisfy the standard assumptions (for                example,  by containing some anomalous observations or by having                heavy tails),  ANOVA-like procedures are needed that perform well               across a broad range of underlying distributions.  A number of                  proposed robust procedures for the more general class of linear                 models,  which also includes regression,  may be applied in ANOVA               situations,  but evidence on their performance in small samples                 is still too limited to permit choice of a preferred technique or               to make the necessary components (including estimates of effects                and their standard errors,  corresponding tests of hypotheses,                  and detailed critical tables) available for statistical                         applications.  The proposed research will investigate several                   procedures for robust ANOVA,  mainly based on M-estimation,                     using large-sample results and Monte Carlo to establish their                   properties in small samples.  The work will  at first emphasize                 the most widely used designs:  two-way and one-way layouts.                     Previous work by Bickel,  Draper, Fellner,  Hampel,                             Hettmansperger,  Hoaglin,  Huber,  Johnson,  Kafadar,  Lehmann,                 Mosteller,  Rocke,  Ronchetti, Rousseeuw,  Schrader,  Stahel,                   Tukey,  Yohai,  and Zamar will provide the main starting points.                     The research proposed by Mosteller and his associates will                 continue a line of work long supported by the Division of Social                and Economic Science that has over the years produced many of the               most innovative developments in statistical methods for making                  sense of social science data.  The Principal Investigator has a                 most distinguished reputation among both social scientists and                  statisticians because of remarkable production of both technical                and more accessible textbook materials describing and                           illustrating methods that continue to be developed.",
