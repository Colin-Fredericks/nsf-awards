 "awd_abstract_narration": "One factor thought to play an important role in sex ratio                  evolution is mating pattern.  In the 1930s, R. A. Fisher                        predicted that a 1:1 ratio would evolve in species with random                  mating.  Later, W. D. Hamilton predicted that biased sex ratios                 would evolve in populations with non-random mating.  While sex                  ratios correlate with mating patterns across many species, these                predictions have not been tested directly.  This can be done by                 allowing sex ratios to evolve, via natural selections, in                       experimental populations with differing mating patterns.  The                   goals of the proposed research are (1) to follow the process of                 sex ratio evolution in genetically variable populations with                    random mating, (2) to determine the behavioral and  genetic                     mechanisms by which sex ratios evolve in these populations, and                 (3) to assess the genetic correlations among facultative sex                    ratio responses to multiple environments.  For the experiments,                 we will use a wasp species in which females exhibit complex                     behavioral control over the sex ratio among their offspring.                    These experiments represent a novel approach to the study of sex                ratio and should provide a rich source of new insights into sex                 ratio evolution in a species with complex, facultative, variation               in sex ratio behavior.",
