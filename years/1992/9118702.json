 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viviparity in the vertebrates first evolved in fishes. The                      transition from ovipairty to viviparity established a series of new             maternal-embryonic relationships, one of which involves the                     transfer of metabolites from mother to embryo. The proposed                     research will investigate the cellular basis of maternal-embryonic              transfer of metabolites across a placenta and test an hypothesis                about the evolutionary origin of that placenta. Goodeid fish will               be used as a model system because their gut-derived placenta                    exemplifies one of the two major routes of placental evolution.                 Goodeid embryos develop within the ovarian lumen where they grow                considerably (150X) due to absorption of maternal nutrients.                    Maternal nutrients are transported across the ovarian lumenal                   epithelium into the ovarian fluid where they are absorbed by the                trophotaenial epithelium of the embryo. Trophotaeniae are external              perianal projections of the embryonic intestinal epithelium. There              are two types of trophotaeniae: long, ribbon trophotaeniae whose                cells function in macromolecular endocytosis, and short, rosette                trophotaeniae whose cells function in the transport of small                    molecules. The lumenal epithelium of the maternal ovary and the                 trophotaeniae of the embryo constitute a placenta. We will                      investigate the endocytotic and small molecule transport function               of the trophotaeniae. We will also test our hypothesis that                     trophotaeniae are embryological and evolutionary derivatives of the             embryonic hindgut and that the endocytotic and small molecule                   transport configurations of ribbon and rosette trophotaenial cells              are alternative  and successive states in one sequence of                       differentiation. To achieve these goals, we will determine the                  kinetics of small molecule uptake and macromolecular endocytosis,               elucidate the receptor recycling pathway, characterize enzymes of               the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, and analyze the structural                     differentiation of trophotaenial cells and their putative                       evolutionary and embryological precursor, the  intestinal                       absorptive cell.",
