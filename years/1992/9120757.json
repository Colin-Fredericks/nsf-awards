As an amalgamation of self -                         categorization theory, the optimal distinctiveness model                        assumes that social identities are selected or adopted by                       individuals in order to satify opposing social needs for                        differentiation and assimilation.  Group identification will be                 satisfying to the extent that it provides simultaneously for a                  sense of distinctiveness and for inclusion in a social collective.              Thus, the theory implies that individuals will seek membership                  in groups that are relatively exclusive rather than inclusive,                  and will react negatively to threats to ingroup distinctiveness.                                                                                                Prior research on optimal distinctiveness theory has established                that depersonalization (categorization in overly inclusive groups)              enhances identification with more distinctive groups, independent               of the status associated with group membership.  The current                    research, a series of laboratory and field experiments, will test               further implications of optimal distinctiveness theory, including               (1) group identification in response to excessive personalization               (individual uniqueness), (2) effects of social identification on                response to intragroup versus intergroup social comparison, (3)                 effects of group distinctiveness on perceived differentiation among             group members, and (4) effects of threat to group distinctiveness               on self-presentation and commitment to ingroups.",
