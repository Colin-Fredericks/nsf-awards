 "awd_abstract_narration": "This material handling project addresses behavior based control                 for autonomous tending of manufacturing workcells.  Automation                  systems assume that all objects are where they are supposed to be               and that sensors and machines function as they are meant to.                    Failure to satisfy these assumptions can often result in                        catastrophic failure.  Methodologies that facilitate the                        integration of sensors, computers and machines in order to                      autonomously accomplish complex tasks, i.e. sensing and dealing                 with the unexpected, are not well developed at all.  This project               proposes a behavioral control strategy to accomplish these tasks.               The idea is based on observations of naturally occurring examples               of autonomous systems, such as animal behavior.  The strategy is                based on the implementation of multiple behaviors taking                        advantage of multiple sensors and actuators functioning                         concurrently.  Such ideas have been tested on robots, and the                   result has been to provide  a successful strategy for robust                    operation in dynamically changing, unstructured environments.                   This project proposes to use this approach in the tending of                    machine tools used for low volume batch manufacturing, including                the transfer of tool and parts among stations on the shop floor.                With the experience gained in this research, progress is expected               towards the long term goal of developing a general methodology                  for designing and building an hierarchical structure of                         integrated behaviors which can be use to address many generic                   material handling issues.***//",
