 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the relevance of plague and war to the                  witch hunts which took place in Germany, England and Scotland                   during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  Previous                       historical research has shown that witch-hunting was a patterned                activity that spread throughout Europe and, ultimately, to the                  American colonies.  This study will concentrate on two specific                 threats or crises that have been suggested as causes of the                     European witch craze--plague and war.  The study will examine                   whether witch hunts fluctuated in a manner that correlates with                 similar fluctuations in war and plague.  Data on witch-hunts,                   plague, war and population characteristics will be coded from                   historical works and demographies for GErmany, Scotland and                     England.  These data will be analyzed using time series and                     spatial analysis techniques.                                                         The study will be the first study addressing the hypotheses                relating witch-hunting to plague and war through a systematic,                  quantitative examination of historical and demographic data.  The               study will improve our understanding of the social and economic                 causes of witch-hunting in particular, and of the persecution of                deviant groups in general.",
