 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many years, economists have speculated on the potential cost                savings that could accrue from applying market-based approaches,                such as emissions taxes and marketable emission rights, to                      controlling environmental risks.  Only recently, however, have                  regulatory agencies in developed countries begun to experiment                  with these approaches.  Most new applications are aimed at                      limiting a particular set of environmental hazards, such as air                 or water pollution.  The implementation of these regulatory                     reforms provides a unique opportunity to examine how different                  market-based institutions perform in practice.  The research has                three main objectives: (1) to examine the evolution and                         performance of new market-based approaches for managing                         environmental risk critically; (2) to provide a more realistic                  framework for comparing alternative instruments for controlling                 environmental risk; and (3) to develop rules that would help                    increase efficiency in environmental markets.  The research                     effort collects new data on the performance of environmental                    markets and uses these data to understand factors affecting the                 performance of these markets better.  More realistic models of                  the impact of different regulatory approaches on environmental                  quality and control costs are expected to result from this                      analysis.",
