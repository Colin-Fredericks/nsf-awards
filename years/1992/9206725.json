 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paleolakes in closed basins are sensitive indicators of past               climatic variations.  The chronology of the fluctuations in the                 level of a particular lake can provide evidence of changes in                   local climate, while basin-wide variations reveals past changes                 in the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere.  One hypothesis               resulting from lake studies states that latitudinal shifts in the               jet stream and associated surface weather systems, resulting from               decay of the continental ice sheet, affected the timing of high                 stands of closed basin lakes during the late Pleistocene.  This                 project will develop lake-level chronologies during a critical                  interval of the late Quaternary period for three basins in                      eastern Oregon.  These chronologies will be used to test                        hypotheses concerning atmospheric circulation controls of                       regional climatic change.  Chronologies will be determined from                 radiocarbon dates on samples collected from shoreline sediments.                A physically based evaporation model and a water balance model                  will be used to estimate the range of climatic conditions                       consistent with a specific lake level.  The resulting climate                   scenarios will be employed in a test of the hypothesis that high                lake stands were governed by the mean seasonal positions of the                 jet stream over the western United States.                                           This research will contribute to the regional geomorphology                of a region in need of additional study, and it will further our                understanding of the mechanisms that control regional climate                   changes, and thus the responses of hydrological systems.",
