 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study the perceptual and cognitive processes                 involved in the identification and categorization of sets of visual             stimuli that vary on two or more physical dimensions.  The research             is motivated by decision-bound theory, which assumes there is                   variability in the perceptual information associated with repeated              presentations of every object or event.  The theory assumes that                the perceptual information obtained from any one presentation can               be described by a set of coordinate values along each of the                    relevant perceptual dimensions.  When learning to identify                      unfamiliar objects or events or when learning new categories,                   humans are assumed to construct decision boundaries that partition              the perceptual space into regions.  Each region is associated with              an object or event name or with the name of a category.  When a new             object is encountered, the person determines in which region the                percept has fallen and then identifies or categorizes the object by             the name associated with that region.                                                                                                                           This research will consist of four projects.  The first will                    measure the distribution of information available in a visually-                presented stimulus along the experimenter-defined stimulus                      dimensions.  The second will test for possible interactions between             different functional units in the visual cortex.  When incorporated             into decision-bound theory, the results of these two projects might             be used to construct machines that identify or categorize visual                stimuli as well as do humans.  The third project will study how                 humans learn categories, by focusing on a number of alternative                 descriptions of how category boundaries are learned.  The final                 project will study the time it takes humans to make categorization              judgments.  In particular, the project will try to elucidate the                relation between response time and the positioning of the stimulus              representation in perceptual space and, specifically, on its                    relation to the exemplars of contrasting categories.  This                      knowledge will increase our understanding of how children learn to              read and name objects in their environment.",
