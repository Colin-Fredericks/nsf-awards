 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S-France cooperative research in               computational linguistics between James Pustejovsky of Brandeis                 University and Patrick Saint Dizier of the University Paul Sabatier             in Toulouse.  The project addresses research in the semantics of                word meaning in natural language processing.  The objective is to               combine formal and theoretical work on the representation of word               knowledge and then to define a computational framework for                      expressing this knowledge.  Dr. Pustejovsky brings to this                      collaboration experience in the theory of lexical semantics and                 natural language representation.  His recent research has provided a            contemporary framework for research on lexical knowledge.  This                 is complemented by the French group's innovative methodology for                applying logic programming to natural language processing                       problems.                                                                                                                                                       Lexical semantics, one of the most difficult areas in natural                   language processing, requires effective computational tools. This               project addresses that problem by combining the complementary                   approaches of the U.S. and French investigators.  The results will              advance our knowledge of computer linguistics and contribute to                 the resolution of several practical problems in this field:                     information retrieval, interface between humans and computers,                  machine translation, dictionary design and electronic document                  dissemination.",
