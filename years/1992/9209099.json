 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Julian Humphries is a fish biologist and museum curator                at Cornell University.  He has developed a database software                    system called \"MUSE\" for managing museum collection data with                   microcomputers, and more than twenty natural history collections                (mostly vertebrate) around the world have adopted the system.                   Dr. Humphries proposes to continue development of the software                  system by adapting it to new hardware platforms (Macintosh and                  UNIX machines), and establishing inter-site connections using                   Internet.  Dr. Humphries also plans three workshops to introduce                newcomer museums to collection computerization, to train other                  curators and collection managers in the use of MUSE, and to                     develop community-wide data standards for collection databases.                      The MUSE software system has had great impact on the                       community of vertebrate biologists by making data readily                       available from museum collections.  Access to these data are                    having important impact on research in evolution, biological                    diversity and global climate change, and the community's reliance               on these data will expand and accelerate.  The proposed extension               of the MUSE Project will benefit the research community in                      tangible, immediate ways.",
