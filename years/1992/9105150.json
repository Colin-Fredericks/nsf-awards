 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to expand upon our knowledge of the                          structure, function and chemical reactivity of biological iron-                 sulfur (FeS) clusters, the most ubiquitous electron carriers                    in nature.  Dr. Adams is investigating the structure and                        properties of a new type of FeS center, termed the H cluster,                   found at the catalytic site of hydrogenase.  This enzyme has                    the unique ability to catalyze H2 oxidation and H2 production,                  reactions of fundamental chemical and biological significance.                  In two hydrogenases from the anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium                   pasteurianum, he has shown that the novel H cluster is                          comprised of four to six Fe atoms and has two nitrogenous                       ligands, one of which is displaced when the cluster covalently                  binds CO, a potent inhibitor.  Further potentiometric,                          spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses of these enzymes                    are proposed.  He will also investigate the biochemical and                     spectroscopic properties of an extremely thermophilic version                   of the H cluster in a tungsten-dependent FeS-Hydrogenase that                   has been purified from Thermotoga maritima, a unique                            eubacterium that grows at 90C.  He has show that spectroscopic                  properties similar to those of the hydrogenase H cluster are                    exhibited by the novel FeS cluster of an exceptionally                          thermostable Ferredoxin from Pyrococcus furiosus, an                            archaebacterium that grows optimally at 100C.  Further                          modification of this FeS center will be explored as a potential                 model for the H2-activating H cluster of the hydrogenases.",
