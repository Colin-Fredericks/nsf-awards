 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on two years of investigation concerned                     with creation of laboratory learning environments for                           undergraduate engineering education.  The general theme is how                  to improve undergraduate engineering laboratory education by                    creating visually-oriented learning environments that combine                   computer-based intelligent tutoring systems, interactive                        visualization systems and laboratory instrumentation.  The                      hypothesized pedagogical gain is the enhanced understanding                     that students should receive from interactive computer                          visualization of theoretical concepts that are directly linked                  to the same information provided by laboratory instrumentation.                 The principal practical benefit of the project is the creation                  of builder tools that permit instructors to rapidly construct                   new laboratory curricula in significantly reduced time on                       commonly available computer hardware.  First, the capabilities                  of the current tutoring systems will be expanded by combining                   concept visualization and intelligent tutorial systems with                     laboratory instrumentation.  Second, curriculum building tools,                 student modeling methodologies, and seamless integration of                     common PC/MAC tools into the systems will be explored.  Third,                  specific laboratories will be implemented and tested to                         demonstrate the utility of the tools constructed.  Fourth,                      electronic dissemination of the tutorials will be implemented.                  The long-term objective of this proposed project is to                          integrate new software methods, laboratory instrumentation, and                 intelligent tutoring system concepts to create new learning                     environments for undergraduate engineering laboratories.",
