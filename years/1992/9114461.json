 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Kalyanasundaram Seshadri of                       the University of California at San Diego (UCSD), to                            collaborate with Professor Norbert Peters of the Institute                      for Mechanics at the Technical University of Aachen (RWTH),                     Germany.  The principal objective of their joint research                       is to clarify the influence of strain imposed by the fluid                      flow on the rate of formation of benzene in laminar flames.                     They will focus their research on diffusion flames, and use                     as test fuels methane, ethane and propane.  Experimental                        measurements will be made at UCSD to characterize the                           structure of the reaction zone and the values of strain                         rates beyond which the yellow luminous zone in the flame                        disappears.  The German group will carry out the numerical                      calculations to determine the structure of the flame for                        various values of the rate of strain.   The two groups will                     work together in the asymptotic analysis to determine the                       structure of the reaction zone and predict the rates of                         formation of benzene in the flame.  This division of labor                      will effectively exploit the complementary strengths of the                     two research groups.                                                                                                                                            This research is directly related to the formation of soot,                     as well as benzene, in diffusion flames.  Soot reflects as                      well as exacerbates reduced efficiency in combustion                            engines.  An improved understanding of the mechanisms of                        the formation of benzene and soot could suggest improved                        techniques for reducing pollutant formation and improving                       efficiency in diesel and gas turbine engines.",
