 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an empirical study of interprofessional competition in the              residential land transfer process in the United States and the                  United Kingdom.  The study focuses on competition between                       professionals to secure monopolies within each country and barriers             to globalization of the real property services market.  The study               has the following theoretically derived research objectives: (1)                to identify and describe the claims that are being made by                      competing professions in the two countries, the current allocation              of tasks between competing professions, and the extent to which                 similar tasks are performed by different professional groups; (2)               to assess the results of different divisions of labor in the two                countries in relation to outcomes and to the claims that                        professionals make concerning the efficacy of their services; (3)               to explain why lawyers currently have a monopoly over conveyancing              services in the UK but not in the US; and (4) to explain apparent               local barriers to transnational competition for the real property               legal services market.  The primary means of data collection will               be open-ended tape recorded interviews with lawyers, real estate                agents, title insurance companies, licensed conveyancers, lending               institutions and house purchasers and sellers.  Data will be                    collected in two areas of each country, one urban and the other                 rural.                                                                                                                                                          The house purchase transaction, perhaps more than any other, brings             the general population into contact with the formal legal system.               Nevertheless, no comprehensive study has been made of the land                  transfer process from a sociolegal perspective.  This research will             further understanding of competitive market forces across                       traditional professional boundaries and across transnational                    boundaries.  As such it will illuminate a number of important                   questions regarding the roles played by lawyers and other                       professionals, the factors that condition those roles, the factors              that cause those roles to remain embedded or to change over time,               the ways in which regulation and market structure can affect the                organization and cost of professional services, and the alternative             ways in which markets for housing can be organized.",
