 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a plan to study how the molecular                    structure of CD44, a protein expressed on leukocytes and important              in signalling and adhesion, is related to its function. The project             involves the generation of multiple cDNAs of CD44 isoforms, the                 transfection of cells with each of these cDNAs, and analyses of                 consequent cell behavior. Post-translational modifications of CD44,             primarily in the form of glycosylation, apparently affect the                   binding specificity for the protein. This project also focuses on               changes in the glycosylation in the various isoforms of CD44, and               the consequent changes in adhesion functions for the molecule.                  %%%                                                                                The interaction of endothelial cell glycoproteins and their                  complementary leukocyte receptors directs the extravasation of                  lymphocytes into inflammatory sites. CD44 is the principal receptor             for hyaluronic acid, is constitutively expressed on leukocytes, and             mediates both intercellular attachment and extracellular matrix                 adhesion. CD44 also interacts with intracellular cytoskeletal                   elements, and thus, may provide an important link in coordinating               extracellular attachments and subsequent changes in intracellular               organization. The glycosylation of CD44 appears to play an                      important role in the binding specificity for the protein.                      Functional comparisons of various isoforms of CD44 with differing               glycosylation patterns will provide information on the mechanism by             which leukocytes migrate and insight into the events that transduce             information from the extracellular environment into coordinated                 cellular movements.",
