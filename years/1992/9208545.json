 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to design reaction moldable, carbon               black macromonomers which can selectively and quantitatively remove             a wide range of trace contaminants from the environment and would               also permit for recovery and reuse.  This will be accomplished by               first controlling the chemical nature of both high and low surface              area carbon black particles to provide a range of acidic, basic,                neutral or high polar surfaces in the pores.  The investigator will             then introduce a variety of reactive units onto the surface of the              carbon black to make it behave as a polymerizable macromonomer.                 This will be done through 1) chemical reactions, 2) reaction of                 surface sites with oligomeric units such as resoles, or 3) through              coating with very thin polymeric films, such as polyacrylic acid.               These macromonomers will then be reaction molded to specific shapes             through crosslinking of the reactive groups on the surface.  This               new approach to environmental control could address most of the                 limitations associated with the activated carbon systems typically              in use today.  Features to be investigated in depth include:  1)                the surface area changes associated with different chemical                     treatments, 2) the determination of mechanical properties of the                reaction molded macromonomers and the feasibility for reactivation              of these molded shapes through electrical resistance heating, 3)                the selective adsorption of trace contaminants using the various                chemically treated systems, 4) the design of graded depth filters               for particulate filtration in the range of 50-500A, and 5)                      separation of ionic aggregates where the surface of the                         interstitial opening is designed to display a specific ionic                    character.",
