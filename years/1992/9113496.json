 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Frank Almeda is the Senior Curator of the Botany                      Department in the California Academy of Sciences, and he has                    designed a significant computerization program for the department.              Dr. Almeda proposes to establish a computer linkage to the national             computer network Internet for the Botany Department and the entire              Academy. In so doing, the Botany Department will join several other             large California herbaria in an ambitious program of database                   development. The University Herbarium at the University of                      California at Berkeley is implementing the Specimen Management                  System for California Herbaria (SMASCH), a networked computer                   database of California plant specimens. The computerization program             designed by Dr. Almeda will allow the Academy's important plant                 collections to become a part of the SMASCH database as it develops.                   The proposed plant database initiative has implications beyond            the collections at the California Academy of Sciences. Natural                  history museums and herbaria are establishing world-wide networks of            information sharing, and these computerized information resources               will revolutionize research on biological diversity. Research                   scientists in earth sciences, geography, economics, as well as                  biology will draw on these databases for information that is                    presently unavailable. Future generations of scientists will depend             on data resources such as these as they investigate global climate              change, evolutionary history, and other integrative research                    questions.",
