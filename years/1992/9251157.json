 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nearly every subdiscipline in biology is currently using                        recombinant DNA technology as a research tool.  With the advent                 of this important technology, it is critical that both biology                  major and non-major undergraduate students gain laboratory                      experiences in this technology.  The goal of this project is to                 introduce students to basic recombinant DNA laboratory                          experiences beginning in the General Biology Course employing                   a set of  bacterial recombination exercises.  The recombinant                   DNA experiences will continue in Cell Physiology where the                      students will isolate plasmid DNA, perform restriction enzyme                   analyses, ligate DNA inserts, and perform transformation                        assays.   Completion of an original research project is                         required of all Biology senior students.  The new equipment                     will allow students to participate in a wider variety of                        projects  In addition, acquisition of the requested equipment                   will allow the development and presentation of a new course in                  molecular biology.",
