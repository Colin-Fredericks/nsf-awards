 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports collaboration on polycarbonate/epoxy                        copolymers and coating systems between James Bell, University of                Connecticut and Yu Yunchao, Chinese Academy of Sciences'                        Institute of Chemistry.  Polycarbonate is widely used for optical               applications such as windows in airplanes and trains, or for                    eyeglasses, but has poor scratch and abrasion resistance.                       Epoxies are considerably harder, but do not have the toughness                  and impact resistance of polycarbonate.  In this proposal, the                  mechanical and chemical properties of epoxy-polycarbonate reacted               systems will be investigated, as will the properties of reacted                 epoxy coatings on solid polycarbonate.                                                                                                                          This research could lead to an improved composite with both                     toughness and surface hardness and should help illuminate the                   mechanism of toughening of high glass transition temperature                    polymers.",
