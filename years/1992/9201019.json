 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns mathematical research on problems                    arising in the area of several complex variables.  It involves                  the function-theoretic and geometric properties of bounded                      pseudoconvex domains in n-dimensional complex space and their                   automorphism groups.  The first goal of the research is to                      identify domains with noncompact automorphism groups by the local               geometry of their boundaries. Particular interest is placed on                  boundaries which are not entirely smooth.  The second component                 of the work is the extension of studies on the asymptotic                       behavior of the intrinsic invariant metrics defined on the                      bounded pseudoconvex domains.  The research relates the boundary                behavior of the automorphisms and the compactness of the                        automorphism groups.  Finally, work will be done identifying                    the bounded symmetric domains by their boundary geometry                        among domains with noncompact automorphism groups.  The projects                are connected by the theme that the size of the automorphism                    groups and the boundary geometry of bounded domains are tied                    together.                                                                            The study of several complex variables arose at the                        beginning of the century initially to examine those properties of               classical function theory which generalize to several variables.                It turned out that most properties do not generalize and research               turned instead toward some of the more intriguing geometric and                 analytic questions which arise only when the domains are of                     dimension two or greater.  This project continues that tradition.",
