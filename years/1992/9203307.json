 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluctuations in adult fish abundance are caused by variable                recruitment levels, a consequence of high and variable mortality                during the early life stages.  Causes of high mortality of bay                  anchovy Anchoa mitchilli eggs and larvae in Chesapeake Bay are                  believed to be primarily from predation by abundant jellyfish,                  which are both temporally and spatially patchy.  \"Windows\" in which             anchovy cohorts can develop under low predation pressure are                    hypothesized to provide a mechanism for successful recruitment.  A              conceptual model predicts that anchovy larvae will be transported               up-bay and into the tidal tributaries by estuarine hydrodynamics.               This model and related hypotheses will be tested in this                        investigation.  Bay-wide cruises will map abundances of anchovy                 eggs, larvae and predators, relating them to environmental                      gradients that may affect survival, growth and distribution.  Area-             specific age-frequency distributions, growth rates and mortality                rates will be estimated from daily increments in larval otoliths.               Areas of origin, and probable transport trajectories of late-stage              larvae and juveniles will be determined from otolith microchemistry             by analysis of strontium:calcium ratios, which should indicate                  salinity zones where larvae hatched.  Direct measures of predation              rates will be obtained in large drifting mesocosms under ambient                environmental conditions.                                                            Chesapeake Bay is an appealing ecosystem within which to study             recruitment processes.  Abundant cohorts of bay anchovy eggs and                larvae are presented with wide ranges of temporal and spatial                   variability in predator abundances, food availability and well-                 described estuarine circulation patterns.  The bay-wide analysis                here will provide new information of mechanisms that affect                     survival and recruitment potential of fishes.",
