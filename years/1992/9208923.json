 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Polar Research Board (earlier called the Committee on Polar                 Research) was established in 1958 by the National Academy of                    Sciences, in response to the need for scientific advice on the                  increases in U.S. and international activities relating to the                  polar regions.  The Board is a multidisciplinary body with                      representation from four broad areas: the social, biological and                physical sciences as well as engineering.  Members are drawn                    from academic institutions, national laboratories and industry.                                                                                                 The activities of the Polar Research Board are funded by a wide                 range of government agencies, including the Department of                       Energy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the                  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Office of                  Naval Research, the United States Coast Guard, the U.S.                         Geological Survey, as well as the National Science Foundation                   (NSF).  This grant provides the NSF portion of support to the                   Board.                                                                                                                                                          Activities of the Board during the grant period include                         development of a national polar research plan, providing federal                agencies with advice on the role of arctic and antarctic                        research in studies of global change, examination of current                    issues in glaciology, representing the United States on the                     Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, ensuring active U.S.                scientific participation in the International Arctic Science                    Committee activities, as well as completing a series of studies                 relating to more detailed problems of polar research.",
