This is a collaborative project with                    Professor Donald Kouri of the University of Houston whose                       effort is also being supported by the Division.  The Feynman                    path integral method is used to replace the customary                           calculation of matrix products, eigenvalues, and inverses which                 scale very rapidly with system size.  Gaussian importance                       sampling is used to produce a manageable variance in the Monte                  Carlo integral.  The goal is to make possible fully quantum                     mechanical treatment of scattering systems of a larger size                     than previously possible.                                                       %%%                                                                             Numerically exact quantum mechanical methods for analyzing                      chemical reactions have in the past been limited to systems                     containing no more than three atoms, at least one of which must                 be hydrogen.  This project is testing a new computational                       technique which offers promise of permitting such calculations                  on larger systems and, more generally, can be used in studying                  other quantum mechanical collisional processes.",
