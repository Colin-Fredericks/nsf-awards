 "awd_abstract_narration": "The escalating costs of medical care are having a significant              impact on the economy of the United State.  An Industry/University              Cooperative Research Center on Health Management could research how             effective management would better control and minimize costs.                        A planning meeting will study if industry will support an                  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Health                       Management to be headquartered at Arizona State University.  While              the initial research interests of industry have been found to be                focused on \"New Ways of Delivering Patient Care\", \"Physician -                  Organization Integration\" and \"Implementing New Ways of Managing                Quality\", the meeting will assess industry interest and determine               if the  Center has sufficient support and merit to meet the                     Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers Program criteria.                   The Principal Investigator and Director as well as the                     proposed consortium of researchers from universities across the                 United States are recognized as eminent researchers and have the                resources for this planning meeting.                                                 This project has been coordinated with Dr. Lynn Pollnow in the             Division of Social and Economic Science at the National Science                 Foundation.                                                                          The Program Manager recommends Arizona State University be                 awarded $9,840 for one year for this planning meeting.",
