 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. George A. O'Doherty has been awarded a postdoctoral                         Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. O'Doherty's doctoral degree was                    from Ohio State University under the supervision of Professor                   Leo Paquette. Dr. O'Doherty intends to continue his research at                 Stanford University with Professor Barry Trost. In his                          postdoctoral research Dr. O'Doherty will learn about the use of                 organometallic reagents in organic synthesis. This will help                    him towards a career goal of developing novel synthetic organic                 reactions based on odd electron organometallic reagents and                     using them for the construction of large ring compounds.                        %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                    knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                    meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
