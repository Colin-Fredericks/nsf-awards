 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biochemistry and Cell                                    Biology at SUNY Stony Brook will renovate five                                  laboratories into modules for graduate,                                         undergraduate and postdoctoral research and                                     research training.  The renovated laboratories                                  will bring together four recently appointed                                     faculty members from Biochemistry and Cell Biology                              who share common research interests.  The                                       renovation plan permits these junior faculty to                                 all be moved in proximity of each other and to                                  provide room for growth of their research programs                              and room for collaborative projects.  A common                                  theme of research of these cell biologists is                                   macromeolecular transport through the cell.  To                                 further encourage interactions among these faculty                              and their students, all of their laboratories will                              open to a common central corridor with shared                                   facilities.                                                                          The renovated laboratories will also adjoin                                two recently renovated laboratories belonging to                                faculty members in the Department of Neurobiology                               and Behavior.  The proximity of these researchers                               will also act as a catalyst for the production of                               a mutually nurturing and creative environment                                   between two departments in the Division of                                      Biology.",
