 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most procedures labeled \"Empirical Bayes\" that are in use at               present are frequentist rather than Bayesian; although often the                motivation for employing Empirical Bayes procedures is the                      conceptual or the computational difficulty of the analogous Bayes               procedures.  This research broadens the  Empirical Bayes                        framework and then examines the  comparative behaviors of the                   several methodologies with respect their performance and their                  feasibility.  Theoretical results defining conditions of                        superiority for Empirical Bayes methods will be sought.                         Empirical results from simulations and theoretical results for                  properties of Empirical Bayes estimators will be applied to                     reliability theory.                                                                  Statistical analyses draw on models or on prior information                and expert opinion to set the framework for analyzing data.  In                 certain circumstances the data itself can be used to determine                  the framework as well as be analyzed within the framework.                      Procedures of this type are called \"Empirical Bayes;\" and these                 can be viewed in some sense as a hybrid of model-based                          (frequentist) and prior information-based (Bayesian) procedures.                This research will investigate the circumstances under which each               class of procedures is significantly superior to the others for                 applications in reliability testing and estimation.",
