 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is to investigate a cognitive engineering based               approach which incorporates user's (operator's) cognitive                       characteristics into the interface design of decision                           support systems (DSS) for troubleshooting advanced  manufacturing               systems.  The objectives are (1) to verify operator's task-related              knowledge model which is derived from a cognitive theory of human               knowledge systems; (2) to evaluate usability of a theory-based                  interface of DSS which is designed through integrating  operator's              knowledge model and advanced human-computer interaction technology              (direct manipulation).  Three experiments will be conducted to test             hypotheses on three aspects of operator's knowledge model:                      structure, content, and control strategy.  An additional experiment             will be conducted to compare usability of the theory-based                      interface to that of a conventional interface of DSS.                                The research will enhance the understanding of operator's                  supervisory control behaviors and lead to a design model for the                interface of DSS.",
