 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Timothy Earle, Mr. Banks Leonard will                collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  Building on previous               fieldwork in the region, he will conduct an intensive survey of                 the Chicama Valley in northern coastal Peru to locate and examine               Chimu and Inka archaeological sites.  The work has three phases.                First, Mr. Leonard will employ air photographs to locate large                  formal sites.  He will then study these on the ground through                   mapping and surface collection.  Extant above-ground architecture               will be carefully described and photographed.  Secondly, an                     intensive surface survey of a 2 km. wide transect in each of                    three areas will be conducted to locate smaller sites.  They will               be dated and their functions determined.  Finally, Mr. Leonard                  will trace and map major irrigation canal systems to reconstruct                prehistoric agricultural practices and trace their development                  over time.                                                                                                                                                      The arid inhospitable coast of Peru saw the rise of several                     kingdoms before the arrival of the Spanish.  The Chicama Valley                 documents two of these: the Chimu state which developed locally                 and a later Inka empire which was externally imposed and extended               from Bolivia to Argentina.  Archaeologists are interested in how                states arise and are maintained and what types of variation among               them may exist.  Because environment and geography may be                       controlled, the Chicama Valley provides an excellent locale to                  examine this issue.  Preliminary work by Leonard indicates that                 large numbers of sites (many unstudied by archaeologists) are                   present and that the dry desert environment has resulted in                     excellent preservation of cultural remains.  Mr. Leonard posits a               number of hypotheses about how control of this region may have                  been maintained and the archaeological data will allow him to                   test these.                                                                                                                                                     This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data of interest to many archaeologists.  It will increase our                  understanding of how complex societies arise and are maintained.                It will also further the training of an extremely promising young               scientist.",
