 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a visit by Dr. Robert E. McIntosh of the                    University of Massachusetts Amherst to the University of New                    South Wales, Australia, to work with Professor M.L. Banner to                   investigate sea state behavior under very strong wind                           forcing.  The proposed investigation would install unique                       instruments developed at the University of Massachusetts and                    NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center on a specially equipped                        Australian aircraft to collect and analyze data that would                      make significant advances in three important areas.  It would                   (1) establish the aerodynamic drag of the sea surface for                       very strong wind forcing conditions typical of intense                          storms, improving our ability to make reliable forecasts of                     sea state, (2) quantify the attributes of the ocean directional                 wave spectrum under these extreme conditions, (3) determine                     the electromagnetic (EM) bias that the TOPEX satellite radar                    altimeter will be subject to for the very high seas and winds                   encountered in the Southern Ocean.  By establishing the                         relationship between the wind speed, wind stress, the wind                      wave field, and the EM bias for very high seas and winds, this                  project will have a major impact on improving the reliability                   of the algorithms used in remote sensing of the sea state and                   marine winds and of ocean forecasting, as well as improving                     the ability of satellite altimeters such as TOPEX to study                      the Southern Ocean circulation.",
