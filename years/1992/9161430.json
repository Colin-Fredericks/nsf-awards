 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future optical interconnect architectures with vertical and                     lateral paths will need to be silicon-based for integration of                  waveguides, modulators, and detectors with microelectronics.                    Current research efforts concentrate on operation beyond the                    band-edge wavelength of 1.12 um, where silicon is nominally                     transparent.  Potential integration of optoelectronic devices at                wafer level may lead to the development of optical                              interconnection technologies based on infrared light sources at                 1.3um.  Recent research in this area indicates that a refractive                index change as large as 0.01 can be achieved in silicon even                   though silicon does not exhibit a linear electrooptic effect.                   This electrically induced refractive index change is based on the               free-carrier effect, (e.g., in a p-n junction) and can be used                  for light modulation.  Physical Optics Corporation proposes to                  use its holographic recording of photoresist gratings to develop                an optical modulator based on a waveguide grating coupler.  The                 coupling efficiency can be modulated by very small changes of                   refractive index in the structure because of the narrow                         acceptance angle of the guided mode.  Full modulation depth of                  the guided wave can be achieved with current densities under 10                 uA/um2.  This structure can be also used for spatial light                      modulators.",
