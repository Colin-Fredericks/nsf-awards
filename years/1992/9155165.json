 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boston College will conduct a three-year project to enhance                     mathematics teachers of grades 7 through 12 in basic                            knowledge of discrete mathematics topics, in implementing                       discrete mathematics in their classroom and in sharing                          instructional experiences with their students and teacher                       colleagues.  Discrete mathematics content areas to be                           addressed are social choice, graph theory, recursion,                           counting and matrices.  Two possible ways to fuse discrete                      mathematics into the secondary curriculum will be                               considered:  a separate course in discrete mathematics for                      upper secondary students, and an infusion of discrete                           mathematics topics into all existing secondary mathematics                      classes, beginning at the middle school level.  Emphasis                        will be placed on mathematical problem solving, reasoning,                      communication and connections.                                                                                                                                  Project activities include an initial three-week summer                         leadership workshop for 22 teachers with experience in                          teaching discrete mathematics.  These leader-teachers will                      be trained to become members of leadership teams who,                           together with Presidential Award Winners who are members of                     the project's senior staff, will conduct three-week summer                      workshops in six regions of the country in years two and                        three of the project.  Three hundred sixty second-wave                          teachers will participate in these workshops  which will                        include a follow-up session to bond teachers at the local                       level into a support network for implementing discrete                          mathematics. In turn, these teachers are expected to conduct                    inservice activities within their school district, reaching                     approximately 4000 of their colleagues in third-wave                            enhancement, for a total of 4382 teachers so enhanced.                                                                                                          This proposal addresses the enhancement of teachers in an                       important area of mathematics, new to the secondary                             curriculum.  And the teachers-teaching-teachers pyramid                         model lends itself to wide dissemination.                                                                                                                       Boston University, University of North Carolina, Illinois                       State University, S.W. Texas University, Portland State                         University, and California State Polytechnic cost-sharing                       accounts for 3% of the NSF budget.",
