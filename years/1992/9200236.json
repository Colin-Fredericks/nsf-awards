 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year REU Site at Northwestern University on                          Infrastructure Innovation is designed to attract native born or                 permanent residence students to research careers in this area                   within Civil Engineering and to nudge participants toward                       independent research.  Student interaction is maintained by twice               a week orientation meetings which address research skills common                to all work, as well as informal chats with the REU professors to               convey the excitement of a research career.  Research results are               presented both orally and in a report of sufficient quality for                 publication to ensure training in technical communication.  As an               important addition, a new initiative will be undertaken to develop              a program for local industry to employ REU fellows for four                     additional weeks in research/development positions.  Post REU                   completion industrial placement will be increased each year with                a goal of 100% placement during the third year.",
