The immediate goal of the Young Scholars Research Program (YSRP)                will be to enable qualified high school students, principally women             and minorities, to acquire the prerequisite skills, career                      awareness, philosophical and ethical attitudes necessary to                     encourage them to pursue successfully preprofessional or                        professional education studies in scientific, technical and health-             related fields via a consortium that includes SUNY-Binghamton,                  Broome Community College and various local companies.  Students'                views of numerous career opportunities in the sciences and related              fields will become broadened with exposure to a wide variety of                 seminar topics, laboratory activities, university interactions and              industrial experiences.  They will have a unique opportunity to                 become an integral working member of a research team.",
