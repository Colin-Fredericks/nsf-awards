 "awd_abstract_narration": "The history of science in America cannot be discussed without                   acknowledging the central role that James McKeen Cattell (1860-                 1944) played in its development.  He was a psychologist trained in              Europe whose first experiments led directly to the formation of                 behavioralist psychology, and he originated the first program of                mental tests in 1890 as part of a goal of creating an applied                   psychology.  Yet his major contribution to science was not in the               field in which he was trained.  For Cattell played a major role in              the emergence of Columbia University and the New York scientific                community; he was a long-time owner and editor of the journal                   Science  as well as a number of other important scientific                      periodicals;  he created American Men of Science (now American Men              and Women of Science) and controlled for many years the American                Association for the Advancement of Science.  His mark thus remains              indelibly on the major institutions of modern American science.                 Dr. Sokal is undertaking a major study of Cattell's life and work.              Dr. Sokal argues that Cattell approached his work with an                       understanding of science rooted in the 19th century.  He plans to               trace how Cattell's 20th century significance emerged directly from             his 19th century attitudes.  This study promises to enhance our                 understanding of how American science came to be organized as it is             today.",
