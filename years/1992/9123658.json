Postcranial             variation will be examined with respect to differences in body                  size, ecology and relative phylogenetic relationship. Ceratomorphs              present an ideal case for assessing variation in locomotor anatomy              with respect to these interrelated and often confounding factors.               Because of enormous variation in body size (ceratomorphs include                the largest known land mammals in the fossil to investigate the                 more general question of the mechanical basis for patterns of                   mammalian size-scaling. Analysis of external size and shape will                be supplemented by cross-sectional geometric data (second moment                of area, section moduli, cortical area) derived from computed                   tomography. Special attention will also be paid to long bone                    curvature, mechanical advantages of extensor muscles, and articular             size and shape. These data and analyses will provide new insights               into the functional anatomy and paleobiology of ceratomorphs                    specifically and should contribute to our understanding of general              principles governing diversity of structural design in the                      mammalian locomotor system.",
