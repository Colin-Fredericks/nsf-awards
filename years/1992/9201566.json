 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin of species is a fundamental problem in biology.  An                  enduring controversy concerns the relevant importance of                        geographic isolation versus ecological specialization in                        promoting speciation.  Sponge-dwelling shrimps (Synalpheus) are                 highly diverse (100 species) and abundant on coral reefs                        worldwide; several characteristics make them ideal candidates for               testing whether niche shifts can initiate speciation in sympatric               populations.  These include high host specificity, low mobility,                and mating in association with the host.  Recent studies have                   revealed significant host-associated differentiation in                         demography and allozyme frequencies within Synalpheus species, as               well as high frequency of undescribed host-specific cryptic                     species.  This research will develop 1) a critical analysis of                  genetic (allomyze) and host use differentiation among sympatric                 versus geographically distant demes of the widespread host-                     generalist S. brooksi; 2) analyze genetic, behavioral, and                      morphometric characteristics of several currently unrecognized                  cryptic species of Synalpheus and their host associations; 3)                   construct a phylogenetic tree for Caribbean Synalpheus, including               newly defined species, onto which host use data and life history                characters can be mapped to test rigorously for association                     between the sponge-dwelling habit and the radiation of this                     group.",
