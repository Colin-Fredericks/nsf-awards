 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the research of a cultural anthropologist                 studying small-scale irrigation systems in Spain.  The project                  will study systems in the mountains and in the lowlands of Spain,               to compare with a previous study of a highland and lowland                      irrigation system in Peru.  Using a methodology borrowed from                   \"expert system\" computer models, the project will create a model                of small-scale irrigation system management.  Built from specific               cases of conflict and management decisions, the model will reveal               the underlying values and constraints operating on this case.                   The model will then be compared with that fitting the Peruvian                  irrigation systems, in order to separate the influences                         attributable to altitude from those attributable to cultural                    history.                                                                                                                                                        This research is important because small scale irrigation systems               are natural models of resource management that have usually                     worked over periods of time.  In a world where there is current                 concern about global conservation and environmental degradation,                this sort of case study of a naturally evolved management system                can yield valuable insights to help planners design management                  systems for other resource domains.",
