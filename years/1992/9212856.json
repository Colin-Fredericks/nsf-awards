 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop facilitates inquiry of the global forces influencing              changes in property rights related to land today and over the past              two centuries.  One of the workshop's key issues is: have there                 been converging trends in land rights during recent world history?              Another is: do certain property regimes invariably lead to land                 degradation and other, negative environmental outcomes related to               the land?                                                                                                                                                       A dozen scholars from several different disciplines whose expertise             reaches across a number of world regions are participating in the               workshop.  Specifically, they meet for four sequential sessions                 over a span of two years, each presenting, critiquing and refining              an analysis of these issues for a given world region.  A second                 stage of the workshop focuses on the development of a synthesizing              essay that looks at trends in property regimes and their influence              on environmental issues from a global perspective.  The project is              significant in advancing basic understanding of the evolution of                property rights due to its transnational focus and contributing to              global policy debates about how to govern human use of land in the              contemporary world.",
