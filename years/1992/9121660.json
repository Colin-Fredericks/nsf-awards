 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to investigate the ionospheric plasma structures using               two techniques: tomographic technique and scintillation                         technique.  Each is summarized in the following.                                1.   Tomographic technique: Our simulation studies over the past                     several years, as well as several studies by others, have                       demonstrated the potential and capability of imaging                            ionospheric structures of horizontal scales from tens of                        kilometers to hundreds of kilometers.  We propose to set up                     a network of stations to receive Doppler shifted signals                        from the navigation satellites NNSS for the purpose of                          imaging the equatorial ionosphere using the tomographic                         technique to learn about the dynamics of the equatorial                         anomaly region.  This project has associated tasks in repair                    and modification of donated JMR geodetic TRANSIT receivers,                     development of a low-cost PC based data acquisition system,                     development of receivers at selected field sites, data                          management and processing, further development of computer                      algorithm, and data interpretation.                                        2.   Scintillation technique: This project is concerned with                         analyzing already collected scintillation data at various                       sites of geophysical interests.  One station (Spitzbergen,                      77.00oN, 15.55o, geomagnetic dip 73.43oN) is a polar cusp                       station.  The small structures observed by the scintillation                    technique can be related to the presence of auroras, the                        configuration of the interplanetary magnetic field,                             electromagnetic omissions, etc.  In the Pacific-Asia region                     data from a network of stations have been collected to                          analyze the relation of scintillation with the traveling                        ionospheric disturbances.  At equator the scintillation data                    can be correlated with the radar data to investigate the                        relation between ionospheric motions and the production of                      small ionospheric structures.",
