 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wilson's research objectives are divided into three                    major categories:  supernovae, heavy ion collisions and neutron                 star collisions.                                                                     Research in supernovae includes the clarification of the                   nature of the supernova explosion mechanism utilizing a numerical               computer model, surveying the implications to particle physics of               supernova events and providing theoretical and design support for               a prototype supernovae neutrino observatory now being                           constructed.  Interesting results are expected from all these                   projects, in particular, restraints on massive neutrino models                  (with their associated oscillation properties) and axion mass                   limits.                                                                              The heavy ion collision project is based on modeling the                   collision of heavy ions by a hydrodynamical approximation for the               baryons and a mean field model for the pions.  From comparison of               the model with heavy ion collision experiments at low energies                  (about one GeV per nucleon) important information for supernovae                equations of state will be derived. At higher collision energies,               the issue of nuclear transparency will be addressed.                                 A numerical program to study the collisions of neutron stars               has almost been completed.  The frequency and total energy                      emitted in gravitational radiation will be computed as well as                  the neutrino signal expected during the final spiraling inward                  and coalescence of a neutron star pair.",
