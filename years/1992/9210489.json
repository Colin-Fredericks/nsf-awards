 "awd_abstract_narration": "One source of difficulty for time dependent problems for                   composites is the presence of an additional length scale in the                 form of frequency or time of observation.  The goal of this                     project is to obtain a cogent description of the response of                    composites to time-dependent loadings and to arrive at effective                medium theories which give a macroscopic description of the                     response.  In this phase of this continuing research, the                       emphasis will be on those cases where the interaction of the                    stress and displacement field in the composite with the boundary                is expected to be strong.  Of interest is the description of                    boundary layer-type phenomena, and their influence on the                       macroscopic behavior of the composite.  The tools used will be a                combination of asymptotic analysis, analytical methods for                      partial differential equations, and numerical experimentation.                  The eventual goal is to arrive at accurate and efficiently                      computable models of wave propagation in, and vibration of,                     composite structures.                                                                Composite materials are now commonplace building materials,                especially in high-tech applications, therefore it is important                 to know their mechanical properties.  The goal of this research                 project is to build on the knowledge-base on the mechanical                     properties of composites, with particular emphasis on their                     dynamic behavior.",
