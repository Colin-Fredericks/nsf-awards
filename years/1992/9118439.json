 "awd_abstract_narration": "The annual advance and retreat of pack ice may be the major                     physical determinant of spatial/temporal changes in the structure               and function of antarctic marine communities.  Interannual cycles               and/or trends in the annual extent of pack ice may also have                    significant effects on all levels of the food web, from total                   annual primary production to breeding success in seabirds.                      Historical records indicate a 6 to 8 year cycle in the maximum                  extent of pack ice in the winter.  During this decade winters                   were colder in 1980 and 1981, and again in 1986 and 1987.  In                   order to understand the interactions between pack ice and                       ecosystem dynamics, especially the influences of the well-                      documented interannual variability in ice cover on representative               populations, a long-term ecological research (LTER) site has been               established in the Antarctic Peninsula region near Palmer                       Station.  The LTER project, will conduct comprehensive                          measurements of ice-dominated ecosystems in this region with a                  focus on primary production, krill populations and swarms and                   seabirds.  A primary emphasis will be placed on the development                 of ecosystem models that will provide a predictive capability for               issues related to global environmental change.                                                                                                                  This proposal will add to the existing LTER project detailed                    studies of the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and associated                  bioelements.  The microbiology and carbon flux component of LTER                will provide measurements of a suite of core parameters relevant                to the carbon cycle and will test several hypotheses pertaining                 to carbon flux, including bacterial productivity and nutrient                   regeneration.",
