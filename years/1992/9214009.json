 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this program, two techniques will be used to study the                       fundamentals of materials synthesis via SHS processing; the                     first involves quenching pellets during the reaction, while                     the second involves study of powder particles on a heated                       surface of a substrate.  The first procedure will be carried                    out by reacting a wedge-shaped sample imbedded in a high                        thermal conductivity block,  resulting in extinguishment of a                   combustion wave propagating through the sample towards the                      apex of the wedge.  After quenching, the sample will be cut                     and polished for metallography study and a layer-by-layer X-                    ray diffraction analysis will be performmed to quantitate                       variation of phase content as a function of position.                           SEM/EDXS studies combined with quantitative optical microscopy                                                                                                  will be used to observe changes in local composition, grain                     size, and pore distributions.  Effects of sample preparation                    conditions, such as powder particle sizes and green density,                    will be studied.  These experiments will provide information                    on evolution of mixture micro-structure as the reaction front                   propagates, yielding insight into mechanisms which can be used                                                                                                  to control the process and  tailor the product properties.  In                                                                                                  the second procedure, a narrow size cut of reactant powder                      (lower-melting component) will be dispersed on a foil of the                    other reactant, which will be electrically heated at rates                      typically encountered in SHS processing.  Upon heating, the                     powder will melt and spread on the foli surface; the dynamics                   of spreading (important in SHS processing) will be studied at                   various heating rates and particle sizes.  Upon further                         heating, reactions will occur; these will be quenched by                        current shutoff, and the resulting samples analyzed with                        SEM/EDXS, delineating reaction and microstructure evolution.                    Initially, attention will be focussed on Ni3Al synthesis, with                                                                                                  later extension to other intermetallics.                                                                                                                        The synthesis of advanced materials by combustion reactions is                                                                                                  an  attractive alternative to other methods of materials                        preparation due to simplicity, relatively low energy                            requirements, high product purity potential, and (probably                      most important) opportunity for formation of metastable                         products resulting from the combination of rapid cooling and                    high reaction rates.  In combustion synthesis, highly                           exothermic self-sustaining reactions in a powder bed yield                      final products; in one variant of this procedure, self-                         propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS), reaction                          initiated at one end of the powder sample self-propagates                       through it as a combustion wave, while in another (thermal                      explosion mode) the sample is heated uniformly until reaction                   is initiated throughout the sample.  One very important task                    in further development of combustion synthesis processing is                    establishment of control of product properties via control of                   microstructure; attainment of such control depends on                           fundamental understanding of chemical and structural transfor-                                                                                                  mations taking place in and behind the propagating combustion                   front.",
