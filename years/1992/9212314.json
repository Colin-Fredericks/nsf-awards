 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, of $390,000, is for support of a program of research                and education in the development of advanced chemical microsensors              for industrial process monitoring and control.  The objective of                this project is to enhance the competitiveness of American chemical             and high technology industries by providing a means to monitor                  their processes in real time.  In order to perform this task,                   advanced senor technology is being developed to be employed on-line             in industrial processes.   The major emphasis in this program is                an interdisciplinary effort between the departments of electrical               engineering and chemistry to perform research and to educate                    students -- graduate as well as undergraduate -- in the field of                process chemical sensors.  Courses in basic and advanced sensor                 development and applications are emphasized, and hands-on training              in these areas is also included.  These courses are blended with                existing courses which support an overall curriculum for this                   emerging field of science and engineering.",
