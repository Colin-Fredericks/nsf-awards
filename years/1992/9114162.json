 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work supported by this award concentrates on geometric questions                related to partial differential operators defined on surface-like               regions known as manifolds.  One can visualize the general thrust               of the work by considering a vibrating surface or membrane and                  asking for analytic quantities which capture the geometric                      properties of the surface.  One such class of quantities consists               of eigenvalues of the Laplace operator - a partial differential                 operator - defined on the surface with certain boundary                         conditions imposed on its boundary.  It had long been conjectured               that the ratio of the first two Dirichlet eigenvalues of the                    Laplacian was maximized for surfaces which were flat discs.  This               (the Payne-Polya-Weinberger conjecture) has recently been                       verified by the principal investigator.                                                                                                                         This project will seek to describe surfaces which maximize other                eigenvalue ratios.  At the same time, efforts will be made to                   extend results obtained in Euclidean space to manifolds.  Since                 much of what is known is confined to two-dimensional surfaces,                  extensions to surfaces and manifolds of higher dimension will                   also be addressed.",
