 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to develop, implement and                 test novel concepts for improved control of composite materials                 manufacturing process.  Advanced composite materials manufacturing              is expensive, labor intensive and prone to high part rejection                  rates.  Raw materials costs are only 5 to 15% of the total                      manufacturing cost.  Emerging technologies such as artificial                   intelligence and model-based control, combined with increased                   understanding of polymer processing science and technology, provide             a synergistic opportunity to advance the state of the art in                    composite manufacturing.                                                             A strategy that combines an on-line process model with                     experimential processing knowledge will be researched.  The system              is intended to be adaptive and adjust the processing conditions to              compensate for changes in raw materials or product requirements.                Due to the difficulty of acquiring the processing knowledge and the             volatile nature of this knowledge, a strategy for constant updating             and improvement is also required.  To achieve this, a methodology               for capturing control knowledge from past operational histories of              the process is suggested.  The result of these innovations is an                intelligent processing strategy that will reduce part rejection                 rate and hence the overall manufacturing cost.  The concept will                be implemented and tested on a selected process, namely the                     autoclave curing of composites.",
