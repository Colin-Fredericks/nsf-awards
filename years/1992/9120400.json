 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Compuational Chemistry Program of the                       Chemistry Division will support Kellman in a series of                          theoretical analyses of the dynamics of highly excited                          rotation-vibration spectra of polyatomic molecules.  The work                   will concentrate in three areas:  (1) dynamics of strongly                      coupled vibrations from experimental spectra, investigating the                 relation of spectral patterns to phase space structure                          including low-frequency modes, and phase space structure and                    bond selective reactivity, (2) work with chaotic systems with                   many degrees of freedom including search for dynamical                          constants of motion and quantum number assignments, and phase                   space bifurcation structure and catastrophe maps for chaotic                    systems, and (3) determination of molecular potential surfaces                  from \"bootstrap\" fitting of highly excited spectra.                             %%%                                                                             Modern laser experiments can deposit a large amount of energy                   in molecules, converting them into highly excited states which                  are not easily, if at all, describable in the terms that                        chemists and physicists have used so successfully for matter in                 or near its ground, most relaxed state.  Kellman is developing                  analytical tools to interpret such experiments and the highly                   complex or chaotic states that they produce.  There are                         possible practical consequences in terms of the use of laser                    excitation to affect selected bonds in a molecule, but the                      principle purpose is to understand more fully the nature of                     highly excited molecular matter.",
