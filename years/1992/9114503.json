 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator continues his studies of quantization of                  several differential equations. particularly the Ablowitz-Ladik                 equation and a form of discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation                  called the discrete self-trapping equation.  The equations arise                in describing the behavior of a variety of nonlinear systems,                   many coming from a biological context.  He uses these results to                enhance understanding of several applications: comparisons of                   quantum theories for the two equations, especially focussing on                 the issue of soliton binding energies, analysis of spectral data                for a molecular crystal, and modelling the growth dynamics of                   microtubule.                                                                         A better understanding of how cells behave is a central                    theme in biology.  This project uses mathematical tools to                      consider several related aspects of cell biology and also                       concerns itself with the tools themselves.  Hence the                           investigator studies the structure of microtubule (a kind of                    \"protein crystal\"), undertakes a more general analysis of                       molecular crystals, and develops the theory of certain kinds of                 differential equations that describe nonlinear phenomena.  A                    microtubule is an arrangement of tubulin in a tube-like shape.                  Tubulin is a protein that plays a key role in the ability of                    cells to hold their shape and to move.  So a better understanding               of the growth of microtubule could lead to a clearer picture of                 cell development; this is important in areas as diverse as the                  development of fetuses and the growth of tumors.",
