 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Steven Shackley will               continue his work to locate and characterize obsidian deposits in               the U.S. Southwest. The research will proceed in several stages.                First he will use energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis                 to convert semiquantitative data from materials already collected               into quantitative form. This will aid future analysis and                       facilitate interlaboratory comparison. Secondly he will work to                 discover the location of other obsidian sources which, through                  analysis of their byproducts, are known to have been used by                    prehistoric peoples. The work will be focussed in Arizona and                   western New Mexico and will proceed through the use of regional                 geological maps and interview with local rock collectors. Because               obsidian is often found in alluvial deposits, he will search for                such sources as well. Finally Dr. Shackley will collect samples                 from known sites to determine the degree of intrasource                         variability. This will help him to determine the degree of                      confidence with which archaeological artifacts can be tied to                   individual sources.                                                                                                                                             Obsidian, or \"volcanic glass\" is intensively studied by                         archaeologists for two reasons. First, when fractured it forms                  and maintains extremely sharp cutting edges and therefore was                   prized by prehistoric peoples for making tools. It is often found               in archaeological sites in many parts of the world. Secondly                    different sources usually have descrete chemical signatures and                 elemental analysis often permits one to tie a sample to a                       specific source area. Through analysis of archaeological obsidian               it is often possible to reconstruct prehistoric patterns of trade               and movement. This in turn provides insight into subsistence,                   social and political organization. For this process to work                     however it is essential to locate and characterize all source                   areas and this goal lies at the core of Dr. Shackley's work.                                                                                                    This project is important for several reasons. It will improve                  and expand a data base which will be widely be used by                          archaeologists. It will also shed light into the lifeways of                    prehistoric inhabitants of the United States Southwest.",
