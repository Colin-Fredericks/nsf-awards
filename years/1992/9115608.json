 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oxidative marine photochemical reactions are an important step in               modifying and remineralizing terrestrially-derived DOM, as shown in             individual examples and indirect mechanistic evidence.  Important               classes of marine-derived DOM probably also enter this cycle.  This             project will quantify total photooxidative processes as oxygen                  consumption, by (1) direct O2 uptake measurements where sensitivity             permits, and (2) using an indirect method sensitive enough for                  \"blue water\" and for low-reactivity coastal water studies.  The                 results will provide much-needed quantitative evaluation of the                 role of photooxidation in oceanic carbon and oxygen cycles.                                                                                                     Oxygen consumption, closely related to DOM oxidation, will be                   measured in coastal and estuarine waters and in organic matter                  concentrated by hydrophobic adsorption.  Direct O2 uptake will be               measured using pulsed polarographic electrodes with automated data              acquisition.  A sensitive new indirect technique, calibrated                    empirically against direct measurements, will quantify fluxes of                the primary O2 -consuming species in \"blue\" and low-activity                    coastal waters.  Effects of variables such as wavelength, light                 intensity, temperature, oxygen concentration, and prolonged                     photolysis on O2 consumption rates will be investigated to                      understand their (bio) geochemical significance and to identify the             major mechanisms involved in O2 uptake/C remineralization.",
