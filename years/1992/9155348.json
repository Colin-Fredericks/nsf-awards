 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant would substantially fund a 3 year project which                       would provide 2-week summer inservice training for teachers                     and teacher leaders in physical science. Grades K-12 would be                   included with most of the focus on pre-high school.                                                                                                             The summer workshops would both train a cadre of                                teacher/leaders in conducting workshops (20 per summer) and                     offer direct and indirect training in physical sciences to                      teachers. Local teachers would be the recipients of the                         practice and demonstration workshops in the summer.                             Additionally, trained leaders would be expected to run                          workshops in their own communities and return the following                     summer to share with the new group of leader trainers. The                      total impact would be on 60 trained trainers and 1200 other                     recipients of the training.                                                                                                                                     An additional feature of the project is the ongoing support                     and sharing among those involved. Through academic year                         Saturday meetings, newsletters, a source book, and return                       meetings with new leaders, a substantial communication                          mechanism is established.",
