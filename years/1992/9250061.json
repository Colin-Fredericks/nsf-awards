 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Michigan Statewide Systemic Initiative in Mathematics                       and Science (MSSI) will implement a comprehensive                               transformation of science and mathematics education by                          coordinating policy initiatives already in place with                           curricular, leadership, and partnership initiatives to                          support school-based change in science and mathematics                          education.  Michigan recently passed Public Act 25 (PA 25)                      which provided for the development of a State Core                              Curriculum, a process to review and revise policies and                         programs that inhibit educational change, and a process to                      encourage school-based change through State accreditation.                                                                                                      To further support school-based change, target disadvantaged                    school districts, and transform science and mathematics                         education Michigan plans five connected interventions:                                                                                                          1.   Develop a state vision statement for mathematics and                            science education, circulate it widely, revise it, and                          obtain endorsement from the MSSI Steering Committee,                            the State Board of Education, and a range of                                    stakeholder groups.                                                                                                                                        2.   Design and carry out a systematic review of existing                            legislation and state policies, programs and                                    regulations, that strengthen or impede the vision.  The                         review will be widely shared with district, state, and                          association personnel, and a report on the results will                         be submitted to the State Board of Education,                                   Governor's office, and key legislators.  The                                    recommendations will be reviewed annually to determine                          the extent of implementation.                                                                                                                              3.   Create Models of Effective Learning in targeted school                          districts.  This initiative will focus on economically                          disadvantaged and extreme rural districts, along with                           other districts interested in reform in mathematics and                         science education.  Twenty-five to fifty community                              coalitions will be formed in participating school                               districts and the MSSI will provide technical                                   assistance to them.  The Models will generate new                               knowledge about creating successful community                                   coalitions to reform mathematics and science education.                                                                                                    4.   Reform teacher education programs to bring them into                            line with the state's vision for mathematics and                                science education.  A draft framework that lays out                             this direction will be developed during the project's                           first year.  An incentive plan to implement the                                 recommended reforms will be implemented in years 2 - 5.                                                                                                    5.   Develop and coordinate state-level staff development to                         support mathematics and science education reform                                consistent with the vision statement.  Develop a                                coordinated plan to stimulate and support local                                 district efforts in considering, exploring, and                                 implementing knowledge employed and generated by this                           project and other state-level reform activities.                                                                                                           6.   Create an evaluation plan that will determine the                               success of the project's proposed outcomes as well as                           the success of other state-level activities to reform                           mathematics and science education.  A state indicator                           system for mathematics and science education will be                            developed.",
