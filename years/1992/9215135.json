Project                 funding will enable Dr. Ashraf El-Bayoumi of Alexandria University              to spend a total of seven months in the laboratory of Dr. Charles               Harris at the University of California at Berkeley.  Additionally,              Dr. Harris will travel to Alexandria and spend two weeks in Dr. El-             Bayoumi's laboratory.  This cooperative research project will                   reveal valuable information regarding fast relaxation processes                 that occur in the excited state of several molecular systems.  This             project will provide useful information regarding some features of              the potential energy surface along which the relaxation process                 occurs, the rates of such processes, and the influence of the                   solvent in altering excited-state dynamics.                                                                                                                     This project in physical chemistry fulfills the program objective               of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in                the United States and Egypt to combine complementary talents and                pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                  competence.",
