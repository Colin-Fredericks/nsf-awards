Through a unique collaboration of a national                  environmental education group, a leading non-profit science                     center, and with the co-operation of a federal agency, the                      project's main objective is to convey to a general and school-                  age audience a view of the richness and range of life in the                    underwater realm -- from the deep sea creatures to whales and                   sharks and other marine life.  Narratively, the film will                       proceed through the water column and selected food webs, showing                the relationships in the complex skein of life--including human.                The audience will be guided by explorers and role-model                         scientists, such as Dr. Sylvia Earle, an enthusiastic and well-                 known oceanographer, and three other sets of characters involved                in marine science and exploration.  The content will highlight                  a range of scientific disciplines, including marine biology,                    engineering, geology, physics, and oceanography, and it will                    shed light on the entire study of the oceans as a career path,                  and as an area for further investigation.  Accompanied by a                     educational package delivered and supported by all three groups,                this film will have wide impact, reaching a projected 8 million                 U.S. viewers within two years.",
