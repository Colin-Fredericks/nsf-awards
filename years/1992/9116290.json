 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed three year investigation is a request for a                        continuation of an international exchange research program between              the University of Hawaii and the University of Lecca, Italy                     examining the comparative physiology of intestinal nutrient                     transport in fish of economic importance in both countries.  Hawaii             and Italy both have extensive fish aquacultural activities                      currently underway to help meet the burgeoning human need for                   protein.  A serious problem to fish economic development is the                 production of an artificial diet that is nutritious and                         inexpensive.  The requested extension of this previously highly                 successful research effort will use several in vitro laboratory                 methods to elucidate the mechanisms of sugar, amino acid, peptide,              and short chain fatty acid transport in the intestines and                      associated diverticula from herbivorous and carnivorous fishes at               the two laboratories.  The novel information resulting from these               physiological studies may be important in the future development                of artificial diets for these respective fishes and may reduce the              time necessary for each species to reach their full aquaculture                 potential.",
