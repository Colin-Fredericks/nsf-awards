The researchers intend to concentrate on Banach                        space concepts and questions in classical analysis,                             particularly questions about inequalities.  The groups                          involved are amongst the leaders in this field and have                         cooperated in the past.  Continued collaboration should                         yield increased research activity and output in the                             three general areas of function algebras, operator                              ideals and polynomials.  Any progress in this area would                        represent a significant contribution to mathematical                            research and enable contacts between the US and Poland                          to be substantially strengthened.                                                                                                                               This project in mathematical research fulfills the                              program objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by                         enabling leading experts in the United States and                               Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                        research resources in areas of strong mutual interest                           and competence.",
