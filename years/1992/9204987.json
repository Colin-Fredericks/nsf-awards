 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objective of our research is the elucidation of the               molecular pathways which function in thyroid hormone (T3)                       regulation of Na, K-ATPase subunit genes. In our research to-date,              chimeric genes consisting of a portion of the 5'-flanking region                of alpha2 and alpha3 subunit genes ligated to the coding region of              the firefly luciferase gene have been utilized to transiently                   transfect neonatal cardiac myocytes. Surprisingly, we find that the             expression of both alpha2 and alpha3 chimeric genes is                          significantly repressed by T3 in the presence of co-transfected T3              receptor. These observations are consistent with a preliminary                  finding of T3-mediated repression of endogenous alpha2 and alpha3               subunit gene transcription. In the proposed studies we intend to                examine the underlying molecular mechanism of T3 repression of Na,              K-ATPase alpha2 and alpha3 chimeric genes in rat neonatal cardiac               myocytes to test the hypothesis that subunit gene transcription                 rates are inhibited following an interaction of the T3-receptor                 complex with subunit DNA sequence motifs. Accordingly,the specific              aims of the proposed research are: (1) To determine the effect of               T3 on the rate of alpha2 and alpha 3 subunit gene transcription by              the run-on transcription assay. (2) To ascertain the location and               sequence of the element responsible for T3-mediated repression of               chimeric gene expression (nTRE) through an analysis of T3-                      responsiveness of various truncated subunit/luciferase chimeric                 genes. (3) To characterize the transacting factor which mediates                T3 inhibition of alpha2 and alpha3 subunit chimeric gene activity               by an assessment of binding of both unfractionated nuclear extracts             and purified T3-receptor to subunit gene fragments containing                   negative TREs. We expect that the accomplishment of these research              objectives will provide new and significant information concerning              fundamental features of T3 action at a molecular level.",
