 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the need of the applications specialist             for advanced mathematical programming methods without the heavy                 investment of time which is normally required.  It aims to provide              advanced modeling aids for setting up Lagrangean Techniques which are           usually indispensable when dealing with large complex problems.  This           will be accomplished by imbedding Lagrangean Modeling into an                   interactive environment under state-of-the-art systems such as GAMS             and MPSX/370.  The user will be guided in setting up models and                 associated Lagrangean Techniques without having to code the details.            He will be led by the system and will be able to try out various                options before committing to a final set of decisions (how to                   decompose, how to set the various parameters, how to select from a set          of specialized solvers, how to guide the Lagrangean Dual solution               procedures, etc.)  Various algorithmic devices will be provided as              needed, including: solving the Lagrangean Dual by subgradient                   optimization or dual ascent; providing an overall Branch and Bound              shell; making available special purpose algorithms; modifying GAMS to           take advantage of the decomposition; introducing advanced integer               programming (logical processing, probing) and heuristics.",
