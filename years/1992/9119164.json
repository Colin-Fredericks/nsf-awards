 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                      metallic Chemistry Program, Professor Teddy G. Traylor of the                   University of California, San Diego will continue his studies                   on the mechanisms of oxidation reactions catalyzed by                           iron-porphyrin complexes.  These reactions are models for                       biological iron-porphyrin based oxidations but may also be                      useful for laboratory or even industrial oxidations.  The                       design and preparation of new catalysts and detailed studies of                 the individual steps involved in catalyzed epoxidation of                       alkenes, hydroxylation of alkanes, oxidations of arenes and of                  phenols will be undertaken in this grant period.  Also to be                    considered are the utilization of dioxygen as the oxygen source                 and the use of recently discovered halogenated porphyrin                        catalysts, and especially polymeric versions of these, for                      oxidation reactions.                                                            %%%                                                                             Oxidation reactions are fundamental to many biological and                      industrial processes.  The mechanisms of many of these                          reactions are still unknown and limit the ability of scientists                 to design new oxidants and particularly catalysts for selective                 oxidation of organic compounds.  The research to be performed                   here has as its objective the determination of the way in which                 man-made mimics of biological oxidants react with various types                 of organic molecules.  Recently discovered forms of the iron                    based compounds have unique reactivities that have been                         retained in very stable polymeric forms of the compounds.                       These polymeric catalysts show promise for preparative scale                    laboratory reactions and possibly small-scale industrial                        processes.",
