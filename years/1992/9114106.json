 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of cycles in graphs has long been a central theme                in graph theory and combinatorics research.  A problem that                     traces its roots to the 1850's is that of determining when a                    graph G contains a cycle which traverses all the vertices of G                  exactly once.  Named after William Hamilton, those cycles are                   better known as Hamiltonian cycles.  Not only is this a                         structurally interesting problem, but also Hamiltonian cycles,                  and cycles in networks in general, have important applications in               scheduling, sorting, and even facility design.                                       This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research                    Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on Hamiltonian Graphs to                be held  May 26-30, 1992 at the University of Louisville.                       Professor Roland Haggkvist of the University of Umea (Sweden)                   will be the principal lecturer.  To stimulate interest and                      activity in mathematical research, the National Science                         Foundation each year supports a number of NSF-CBMS Regional                     Research Conferences in the Mathematical Sciences.  Each five-day               conference features a distinguished lecturer who delivers ten                   lectures on a topic of important current research in one sharply                focused area of the mathematical sciences.  The lecturer                        subsequently prepares an expository monograph based upon these                  lectures, which is normally published by the American                           Mathematical Society or the Society for Industrial and Applied                  Mathematics, or jointly by the American Statistical Association                 and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.  Certain features                 differentiate these conferences from typical research                           conferences.  These are: (1) Focus on a single important and                    timely area of research by a leading practitioner, (2) Continued                effect and local stimulation through regional emphasis, (3) Panel               review for quality, breadth, and timeliness, and (4) Published                  monographs for a wider audience.",
