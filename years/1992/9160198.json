 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pollution control field is in need of an efficient, cost-                   effective in situ treatment process to remediate aquifers                       contaminated with chlorinated aliphatic compounds such as                       trichloroethylene (TCE).  Successful in situ treatment of saturated             zone soils and liquid requires the presence of metabolically                    capable bacteria in the polluted target zone.  In many cases,                   metabolically desirable microorganisms may not be present in the                contaminated zone, or may be unevenly distributed throughout the                subsurface.  TCE is a common ground water contaminant that is very              efficiently degraded by the aerobic methanotroph Methylosinus                   trichosporium OB3b.  However, M. trichosporium, like most soil                  isolates, has natural adhesive properties which cause them to bind              to soil surfaces, thus limiting their accessibility to the                      contaminant.  We are generating an adhesion deficient mutant of                 OB3b capable of moving through an aquifer while actively degrading              TCE and related toxic substances. An organism with this capability              would serve as the basis for a cost-effective in situ treatment                 technology, or provide synergistic benefits when combined with                  current pump-and-treat methods of purifying aquifers.",
