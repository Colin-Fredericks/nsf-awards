 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot project will attempt obtain precise radiometric                 ages from critical levels to of an Ocean Drilling Program drill                 core (site 758).  Feldspar mineral grains will be separated from                18 different volcanic tephra layers and then subjected to analysis              using the laser 40Ar/39Ar dating technique.  This method has                    unprecedented sensitivity and precision, and if suitable material               can be extracted from these volcanic horizons, ages with accuracies             to within a few thousand years can be obtained.  Since this core                been studied using oxygen isotopic and paleomagnetic methods, the               time-scale derived could precisely calibrate the entire magnetic                and global climate change chronology over the past 5 million years.             Divergences between the theoretically expected periodicities of                 oxygen isotope ratio variations and the standard magnetic reversal              time scale have raised serious questions about its accuracy.  Laser             40Ar/39Ar dating has probably the greatest potential for resolving              these questions.  However, the project is 'high-risk' in the sense              that is not yet known if sufficient datable material can be                     obtained from ODP cores.  If successful, this project could not                 only improve the currently accepted time scale of global climatic               change, it also has the potential for being able to estimate the                response rate of the earth to the now well-established astronomical             inputs to the earth's climate system.",
