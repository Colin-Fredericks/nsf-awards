 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                       research project between Professor Raymond Viskanta, Department                 of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, and Professor                     Yasuo Kurosaki, Director of the Heat Transfer Laboratory,                       Department of Mechanical Engineering for Production, Tokyo                      Institute of Technology.  Professor Satish Ramadhyani of the                    Department of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue will also be                     involved in the project.  The goal of the project is to develop basic           understanding of both polymer flow in molds and the mechanisms                  of residual stress generation within molded polymers during                     injection molding processes required for production of precise                  molded polymer components.  This is to be achieved by use of in                 situ, noninvasive experimental techniques to obtain test data,                  modeling of the processes, and development of computational                     techniques for simulating real systems.                                                                                                                         The theoretical models will be developed at Purdue to simulate                  processing of polymers during injection molding.  Predictions of                these models will be compared with experiments carried out on the               apparatus at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.  The U.S. and                   Japanese researchers will work together to validate the                         mathematical models developed at Purdue using experimental data                 obtained in Tokyo employing non-intrusive optical (birefringence)               techniques for making temperature and flow measurements during                  the cooling stage of a polymer being molded.  This is a unique                  method that has the potential of determining the frozen layer                   thickness, melt front position, shear stress, and temperature fields            without interfering with the process.",
