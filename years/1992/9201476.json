 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zooplankton are the major pathway for carbon transfer to                   higher trophic levels, and to deeper water and the sediments.                   Estimates of zooplankton production are critical in understanding               how short and long term variations in primary production affect                 these rates of carbon transfer.  Drs. Huntley and Lopez have                    hypothesized that copepod growth is predictable with first-order                precision from habitat temperature alone.  If this relationship                 proves to be robust, we will have a powerful tool for estimating                zooplankton production.  However, the apparent simplicity of this               relation raises major issues about plankton dynamics since it                   denies the usual assumption that zooplankton are food-limited.                       These investigators from the Universities of California and                Hawaii will investigate the thesis that, at the population level,               food limitation of copepods operates mainly through changes in                  mortality rate.  They suggest that there is strong evidence for                 this in fish populations where density dependence operates on the               mortality of the early life stages.  Thus, the general solution of              the Malthusian dilemma for marine populations is to die young                   rather than starve later.  They will address these key questions in             the following ways:                                                             -    (1) Direct measurements of the generation times of a variety               of warm-water copepod species, to fill a critical gap in the                    database;                                                                       -    (2) Experimental testing of the hypothesis that size-specific              predation pressure can compensate for the effects of food-limited               growth rate by increasing apparent development rate at the                      population level.",
