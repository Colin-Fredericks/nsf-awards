 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                       metallic Chemistry Program, Professor Richard Schrock of MIT                    will continue his research on the chemistry of compounds that                   contain metal-nitrogen and metal-carbon multiple bonds with                     emphasis on their use as metathesis catalysts for function-                     alized olefins.  The metals of most interest are molybdenum and                 rhenium.  Kinetic and mechanistic studies to determine the                      effects of coordinated ligands on catalyst activity will play a                 central role in the catalyst development.  The chemistry of                     recently discovered polyimido osmium complexes and compounds                    that contain rhenium-rhenium double bonds will be explored as                   part of this project; in both of these new classes of compounds                 the metal atoms have only two d-electrons.  Finally, studies                    directed toward the development of metal-carbon multiple bond                   chemistry of ruthenium in the +6 oxidation state will be                        initiated.                                                                      %%%                                                                             Olefin metathesis, which refers to pairwise scrambling of                       substituents in compounds that contain carbon-carbon double                     bonds, is an extremely versatile reaction with great tech-                      nological significance.  The single biggest drawback to even                    greater use of this reaction is the failure of known catalysts                  to promote the reaction when there are groups other than                        hydrogen or alkyl attached to the carbon atoms of the double                    bond.  A primary objective of this project is to develop                        practical catalysts for metathesis of such olefins.  Other                      aspects of the work are directed to the synthesis of new                        compounds with unusual structures and/or in which the metal                     atoms have unusual oxidation states.",
