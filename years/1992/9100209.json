This is a renewal award for support of research conducted                       under NSF Grant No. 86-17408 on the adsorption behavior of                      cadmium and lead in water solution to solid surfaces that                       had become coated with biofilms.  Results led to                                development of a mechanistically-based, structured model                        that can be used to predict the behavior of these metals                        in an experimental system consisting of a single bacterial                      species, its extracellular polymer and a solid surface                          under conditions of constant pH and ionic strength.  The                        objective of the renewal project is to extend this                              approach by introduction of ferric iron as a competing                          trace metal to provide a degree of complexity more                              analagous to conditions found in the natural environment                        where adsorption of metals to solid surfaces is of                              environmental significance.                                                                                                                                     Results of this research are expected to develop knowledge                      of factors that influence the formation of biofilms on                          solid surfaces including fixed-film, biofilm reactors that                      are used for the treatment of wastewaters.  Insights                            obtained during this project are expected to lead to                            improvements in the engineering design of fixed-film                            processes for wastewater treatment and may be applied to                        obtaining a better understanding than now exists of                             mechanisms for biofilm formation in sediments underlying                        natural surface waters and in subsurface formations that                        affect the movement of groundwater pollutants.",
