 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator Award from the Inorganic,                  Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports                     research in biologically relevant inorganic chemistry.  The                     emphasis of the project is the elucidation of the role of metal                 ions in important biological transformations.  Of particular                    interest is the participation of transition metal ions in the                   terminal steps of the reduction of dioxygen by cytochrome                       oxidase and the evolution of oxygen by the photosynthetic                       apparatus.  Small molecule analogs of the metal centers of                      these and other metalloproteins, especially                                     manganese-containing proteins, will be synthesized and                          characterized.  The general strategy involves the design and                    synthesis of organic ligands, preparation and purification of                   their complexes with transition metals, and thorough                            characterization of such systems by a variety of structural,                    magnetic, and spectroscopic techniques.  In addition to the                     systems mentioned above, others of interest include the                         magnetically-coupled siroheme and diron-sulfur cluster in                       sulfite reductase, and the participaton of nickel in                            hydrogenase and methanogenesis activity.  Finally, the role of                  low valent vanadium in catalyzing the conversion of dinitrogen                  to ammonia and hydrazine will be explored.  Comparison of the                   spectroscopic and chemical properties of the model compounds is                 expected to yield valuable insight into the detailed workings                   of the modeled biological systems.",
