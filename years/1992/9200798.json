 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ten undergraduates will be selected to participate in research                  projects on the Juneau Icefield, Alaska.  For more than 40 years,               research emphasizing geology, glaciology, geophysics, glacio-                   meteorology, geobotany, and surveying, has been conducted on this               icefield.  With cooperation between the University of Idaho's                   Glaciological and Arctic Environmental Sciences Institute and the               Foundation for Glacier and Environmental Research, this                         research/educational activity aims at a total systems study of                  one of North America's largest icefields.   Under supervision of                professors of unique experience, drawn from the University of                   Idaho and other universities, each undergraduate will select a                  research project and be encouraged to exercise as much                          independent judgment and initiative as possible in its                          development.  Undergraduates selected will be earth science                     students who demonstrate scholarly aptitude, motivation, and                    research potential.  The staff will be available throughout the                 season for advice and help, including lectures, seminars and site               specific instructions in methodologies to insure and effective                  research experience.",
