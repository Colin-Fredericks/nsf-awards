 "awd_abstract_narration": "This standard renewal project involves six three-week                           workshops (2/summer) spread over three summers.  There will                     be approximately 25 teachers/workshop.  Thus, a total of 150                    elementary teachers (2 per school) will be trained to become                    science mentor specialists for 75 Los Angeles area elementary                   schools.  The workshops will provide the mentor teachers with                   lesson plans and kits of materials for hands-on physical                        science units, as well as training to effectively utilize the                   units in inservices for colleague teachers at each grade                        level.  Two support sessions for all mentor teachers will                       occur during the academic year following the workshop.                                                                                                          This leadership project is appropriate for the Teacher                          Enhancement Program because it enhances the physical science                    education of elementary and middle school teachers and                          because it includes a practical plan for participants to                        provide science inservice for all of the teachers in their                      respective schools.                                                                                                                                             Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 30% of the amount                         requested from NSF.",
