 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                  will help the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University                 acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used in                        research by six major users engaged in chemical synthesis.  Of                  the six programs, four have active NSF grants.  Four of these                   organic chemistry projects involve the stereospecific synthesis                 of natural product analogs of bioactive molecules which will                    require high field NMR to characterize complex products.  One                   of these will also use NMR to determine the structure of                        natural products isolated from marine organisms.  The inorganic                 project will use variable temperature and multinuclear NMR to                   characterize new organometallic species and reactions.  The                     sixth project will use variable temperature NMR to study the                    kinetics of free radical reactions.                                                                                                                             Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                      useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.",
