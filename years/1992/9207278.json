 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ponderosa pine is one of the most ubiquitous forest                    trees of western North America, spanning both large altitudinal                 and latitudinal gradients.  It is extensively harvested for                     timber.  This species is very tolerant of drought and abnormal                  soils, is fire resistant, and it regenerates prolifically across                a wide range of environments.  Several varieties exist, and                     morphological, biochemical, and growth trials indicate that these               varieties can be further differentiated into geographic races.                  Several questions remain to be addressed in light of the overall                genetic diversity of the species, its ecological history as a                   recent invader of the forests of the western United States, and                 its susceptibility to range extensions and contractions linked to               future climatic change.  This research project will focus on                    marginal, disjunct populations of ponderosa pine in eastern                     California to determine levels of genetic diversity, to isolate                 the abiotic factors that control their distribution, and to                     document the life histories and demographies of these                           populations.  Ecological sampling will be used to assess                        population variation and demography, and isozyme analyses of                    intra- and inter-population variation will measure genetic                      variation within and among populations.  The approach integrates                two levels of ecological analysis to examine biogeographic                      implications of climate change and geographical isolation for                   populations of this long-lived, widespread species.                                  The distribution of genetic diversity in forest tree                       populations represents the potential of that species to adapt to                and survive environmental change.  Genetic diversity also                       reflects the evolutionary history of a species.  This project                   will advance our current understanding of how genetic diversity                 is distributed among marginal and disjunct populations of a                     genetically wide-spread species.  This information is crucial to                breeding programs and efforts aimed at conservation of genetic                  diversity.",
