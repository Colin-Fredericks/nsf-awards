 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator intends to work on three projects.  The                   first, joint with Avner Ash (Ohio State), deals with arithmetic                 subgroups G of SL(3,Z).  A cuspidal cohomology class for G which is             a Hecke eigenclass generates an automorphic representation which                should be attached to a family of Galois representations.  They                 will study these Galois representations in two special cases.  The              second project involves a general approach to understanding the                 cohomology of G(N) in SL(3,Z) for prime N.  The third project is                joint with Robert MacPherson (M.I.T.).  For any torsion-free                    finite-index G in Sp(4,Z), they have built a G-equivariant                      deformation retract (a \"spine\") inside the symmetric space for                  Sp(4,R); it has properties like those of the well-rounded retract               for SL(n).  They intend to attempt to extend their construction to              non-torsion-free G, and to build a similar object for Sp(6) and                 higher-rank groups.                                                                  The intricate computations envisioned here are intended to                 shed light on structures which arise in important ways in several               different mathematical areas.  The so-called arithmetic locally                 symmetric spaces interest number theorists as well as geometers,                while some of the questions about them have been transformed by the             investigator into pure topology.  No transformation removes their               difficulty, but when looked at in the right way, some difficulties              can be seen to have been addressed by earlier generations of                    geometers.  Seventeenth and nineteenth century geometers studied a              beautiful class of objects known as projective configurations, and              bearing out the mathematical dictum that beautiful objects repay                study because they recur again and again in different guises,                   properties of these configurations have turned out to bear on the               cohomology of certain arithmetic groups, normally considered a                  purely twentieth century invention.",
