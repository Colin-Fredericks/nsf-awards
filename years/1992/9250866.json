 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a novel remotely controlled telescope                     used for undergraduate astronomical laboratories.  The                          telescope is at an existing University-owned Observatory with                   very low light pollution and excellent observing conditions.                    The telescope and camera system are operated via a telephone                    link to the student laboratory on campus.  This relatively low                  cost system allows students direct access to a powerful, highly                 functional instrument which is capable of demonstrating many                    astronomical objects studied in the lecture and textbook but                    which would be difficult or impossible to observe with                          telescopes located on campus.  Both hardware and software is                    designed to be completely hands-on and user-friendly so that                    average students can design and run their own observations with                 minimum assistance.  After an initial period of use at the                      University of Iowa, use of this instrument will be extended to                  other regional colleges who would jointly operate the telescope                 on a shared basis.",
