 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a high                        performance computationally efficient method for real-time                      production control of complex manufacturing systems.  Attention                 will be focused on distributed production control methods that are              \"guided\" by the solution of a continuous flow (fluid) approximation             of the production system.  The continuous flow model will                       incorporate important production control decisions such as part                 release, routing, and machine scheduling, and will provide part                 release and operation-specific production targets for the system                over a sufficiently long time.  These targets will guide the actual             discrete production control decisions via simple distributed                    (local) feedback policies implemented at each machine.                               The vast reduction in computational complexity of the                      production control problem achieved by the continuous flow                      approximation allows the computation (and updating) of the                      continuous production targets in real time.  The actual distributed             control decisions require very little computation.  Thus the                    approach is expected to provide a viable real-time production                   control method.",
