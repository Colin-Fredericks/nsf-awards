One                  long-term goal of this research is to develop and exploit                       techniques to make it possible for scientists to study and solve                problems in mathematics and physics that could not be undertaken                without automated assistance.  Another long term goal is to                     deduce general principles about the nature of human capabilities                and limitations in mental engagement with abstract data spaces.                 intelligent constraint-based interaction (rule-based) methods                   will be combined with semi-automated optimization techniques                    develop a domain-independent interactive system of constraints.                 This system will be designed to allow manipulation of objects                   that are transforms of non-observables which are conceptually                   difficult mathematical properties.  Simulations that transform                  non-observables into manipulatable observables are useful to                    exploit human learning processes to master abstract problems.                   The abstract concepts range from issues of relative size and                    speed estimation, unfamiliar dimensions, and chaotic processes in               physics and interactions in many-body problems.  Domain-dependent               constraints on representations are used to form a model of a                    desired class of spatial configurations.  This leads to a                       rational automation methodology.  Direct, context-free                          manipulation of objects, rather than manipulation of objects,                   rather than manipulation of corresponding surrogate \"control\"                   objects, will also be examined.  This effort seek to lay a                      foundation for understanding human capacity for mental engagement               with visual representations of abstract concepts.  This will be                 useful as a basis for subsequent experiments on psychophysical                  theories of visualization.//",
