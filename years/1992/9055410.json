 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year demonstration project is designed to                            educate 75 New York City elementary school teachers from                        approximately 15 schools to develop materials from the                          urban environment as the vehicle for science teaching in                        their 4th, 5th and 6th grade classrooms.  Objectives that                       are unique to the project are: (1) to  identify issues from                     the urban environment which lend themselves to elementary                       classroom learning; (2) to provide opportunities for                            teachers to use artifacts and issues from the children's                        immediate urban environment as the raw material for                             elementary science investigation; and (3) to demonstrate                        how the NY State Elementary Science requirements can be                         motivated using issues which are both familiar and                              important to children.  Participating schools will remain                       part of the project for all three years, and active                             involvement of administrators will be engaged to guarantee                      school-wide dissemination.                                                                                                                                      This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because it targets a needy urban student population                     and because it plans to develop a cadre of master teachers                      who will mentor their colleagues and work with school                           administrators to plan school-wide dissemination of the                         project.
