Such judgments then provoke hostile retaliation.  This robust                   empirical finding is elaborated in the current research, using                  attribution theory to illuminate the dynamics of aggression and                 to guide the creation of an attributional intervention with                     African American school-aged boys labeled as aggressive.  In                    seven studies, sociometric procedures will be used to identify                  aggressive males and matched groups of nonaggressive subjects.                  Laboratory paradigms taken from social psychology will then be                  used to investigate the antecedents of judgments of intent and                  responsibility.  Among the topics to be examined are: a) whether                aggressive children over-attribute hostile intent to others in                  both aggressive and nonaggressive contexts; b) the likelihood                   that race (i.e., perceived prejudice) is used by black subjects                 as an attributional cue in judgments of self-responsibility; and                c) whether aggressive children understand the communication                     strategies and excuses that are used to mitigate anger from                     others.  These findings will then be used to create an                          intervention designed to reduce hostile behavior among African                  American boys labeled as aggressive.  The intervention will be                  tested in an actual school setting and its development is guided                by the belief that a change in cognition (i.e., attribution to                  intent) should lead to changes in the feelings and behavior that                logically follow this causal inference.",
