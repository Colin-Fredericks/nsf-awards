 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated at transcriptional, post-               transcriptional, and translational levels.  Although the importance             of transcriptional, mechanisms is understood, the role of post-                 translational controls is only beginning to be elucidated.  Several             observations suggest that the iridovirus, frog virus 3 (FV3), may               be an excellent model in which to study post-transcriptional/                   translational gene regulation:  (a) the steady state level of FV3               early messages does not decline in infected cells, whereas host                 transcripts are rapidly degraded; (b) FV3 messages are translated               more efficiently than host or heterologous messages in vitro; (c)               early mRNA is not degraded and, after extraction, actively directs              protein synthesis in vitro; and (d) late viral messages, which are              major gene products in vivo, are translated poorly in extracts from             uninfected cells.  Taken together these phenomena suggest that FV3              gene expression is controlled, at least in part, at the post-                   transcriptional/translational level.                                            %%%                                                                             In this proposal, the nature of putative post transcriptional/                  translational controls will be explored.  To accomplish this, two               specific aims have been established.  Sp. Aim                                   whether the expression of FV3 genes is regulated at the                         translational level by cis-acting mRNA control sequences and/or                 trans-acting mRNA-binding proteins.  Sp. Aim                                    nucleotide sequence of a representative panel of FV3 immediate                  early, early, and late mRNAs and ascertain whether viral messages               possess unique regulatory signals that control translational                    efficiency.  successfully completed these studies will provide                  important information on the mechanisms of virus-mediated                       translational control and on the cis and trans elements that                    regulate viral protein synthesis.  In addition, these studies will              extend our understanding of translational control mechanisms in                 eukaryotic systems.",
