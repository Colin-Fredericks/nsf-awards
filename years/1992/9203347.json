 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a recent series of papers, the principal investigaors                   have explored the use of a correction to the Akaike Information                 Criterion, AICc, and a further-improved version AICi, for model                 selection in linear regression and artoregressive time series                   analysis.  Substantial small-sample improvements in model                       selection performance are found in all cases as the bias of the                 estimator for Kullback-Leibler discrepancy is greatly reduced.                  The investigators propose to build on the above work by                         developing a general theoretical and pracitcal foundation for                   AICc as it applies to small-sample model selection problems in                  time series and regression.                                                          A central problem in statistics is that of selecting an                    appropriate model from a potentially large class of candidate                   models to apply in a particular situation of practical interest.                The selection of an inadequate model can have very serious                      consequences: forecasts of future events may be substantially                   distorted and inaccurate, resulting in incorrect decisions, and                 financial losses.  The development of an effective decision-                    making process therefore depends on the ability to decide which                 model seems best for the data at hand.  The investigators propose               to develop and test improved methods of selecting a model on the                basis of a reasonably small amount of observed data.",
