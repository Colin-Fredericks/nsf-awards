 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human beings generally find their way through environments with                 ease and without injury.  During a normal walk, a pedestrian must               judge direction of movement with an accuracy of about 4 degrees of              visual angle (about the width of two thumbs held at arms' length).              Otherwise he or she risks injury; a driver or pilot risks worse,                and must attain considerably greater accuracy.                                                                                                                  Previously it has been shown that people can find their way based               on information in the global pattern of movement at the back of the             eye, called the retinal flow.  More particularly, as one moves                  through the environment, an individual's natural mode of looking                entails a cycle of pursuit fixations and saccades.  That is, an                 observer looks at a given object (say to the left of his or her                 path) while moving forward on a linear or curvilinear path.  The                pursuit fixation entails a smooth counterclockwise eye rotation                 during locomotion.  He or she then saccades rightward to a new                  object, entailing an abrupt clockwise eye movement.  This cycle                 generally repeats, either again on the left side or reversing to                the right.  Several sources of information are available in the                 retinal flow during pursuit fixation.  The two most important are               differential motion parallax (DMP), the relative motion around a                fixated object where near objects move faster than, and in the                  opposite direction from, far objects, and inward motion (IM), the               motion of objects toward the fovea.                                                                                                                             These studies will continue this basic line of research,                        investigating further the utility of DMP and IM, and exploring new              sources of information, including several entailed in a constant                gaze-movement angle which may be useful in detecting collisions.                In particular, the experiments will determine how moving observers              negotiate moving objects in a rigid environment.  The research                  should result in a deeper theoretical understanding of the limits               and nature of human beings' wayfinding ability, with a long-term                aim of promoting traffic safety.  Stimuli will be presented to                  individual viewers on a computer screen and will be manipulated in              ways that obey the mechanics of the real world and the biomechanics             of human locomotion.",
