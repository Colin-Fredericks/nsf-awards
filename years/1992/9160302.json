 "awd_abstract_narration": "A low cost GPS Time sensor is proposed to be                                    developed which will be suitable for power system fault                         detection and control.  GPS provides a highly precise                           time reference which allows data to be synchronized to                          within 100 nanoseconds between substations and                                  control centers.                                                                Applications of precise time in power control include                           data logging, relay testing, fault isolation and phase                          angle measurements.  Failures can be isolated in a grid                         to a precision of 100 meters by measuring the relative                          time of arrival of a fault at two stations.  Phase angle                        measurements can be determined to a precision of 40                             micro-rad.  As part of this effort, a simulation will be                        performed on the network state estimation                                       performance improvement possible using these precise                            time measurements.                                                              Currently, the least expensive GPS timing receivers cost                        over $10,000.  Such equipment would be very expensive                           to install at tens of thousands of substations throughout                       the electric power grids.  It is proposed under this                            effort to develop a low cost precise time                                       synchronization GPS sensor for use in electric power                            system monitoring.  The proposed sensor will provide a                          highly reliable, time reference accurate to 100                                 nanoseconds for a cost of less than $1,000.",
