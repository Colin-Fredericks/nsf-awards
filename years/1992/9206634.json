 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present body of knowledge in monotone regression is                    confined to some isolated existence theorems about point                        estimation and hypothesis testing.  The investigator plans to                   implement these general methods for as many aspects of regression               analysis as possible.  In particular, formulas for confidence and               prediction intervals will be derived by inverting hypothesis                    tests, since usual methods are inapplicable because of lack of                  pivotals.  The proposed study will also involve construction of                 user-oriented tables to bring the restricted procedures to a                    level comparable to the unrestricted ones.                                           In regression analysis one tries to predict one variable in                terms of another.  In many applications, especially in social                   sciences and economics, it is reasonable to assume that the                     predicted variable tends to increase (or decrease) as the                       predictor variable increases.  Statistical inferences under such                assumptions are at a very primitive stage at present, and consist               primarily of some general mathematical theorems.  The proposed                  study aims at developing concrete formulas and tables so that                   users can apply them directly to real-life problems.",
