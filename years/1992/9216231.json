 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Evan                   Williams' postdoctoral research fellowship. A combination of                    capillary zone electrophoresis and Fourier transform mass                       spectrometry will be used to develop methods for the analysis                   of complex biological mixtures at the attomole level. The                       research involves the construction of instrumentation to do the                 work, the development of experimental methodology to enhance                    sensitivity and minimize sample size, as well as the                            development of Hadamard transform methods which could lead to                   methods for rapid, simultaneous analyses.                                                                                                                                                                                                       %%%                                                                                                                                                             This research will develop methods for analysis of very complex                 mixtures of biochemicals. Such techniques could have major                      impact on the early detection of disease and in forensic                        chemistry. The work is also important to basic research                         scientists who are studying metabolism and toxicity problems.",
