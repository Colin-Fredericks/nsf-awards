 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of an investigation of the inverse                   scattering problems for the multidimensional Schrodinger                        equations when the potential is independent of energy and when                  the potential is proportional to energy.  In the former case, the               Wiener-Hopf factorization and the generalized Muskhelishvili-                   Vekua technique will be used to investigate the characterization                of the scattering data, the relationship between bound states and               partial indices, the inversion from partial data, and the                       stability of the inversion.  In the latter case, the inverse                    scattering problem will be formulated as a Riemann-Hilbert                      problem with a discontinuity of almost periodic type and its                    solution will be obtained through a generalized Wiener-Hopf                     factorization technique.                                                             The solution of the inverse scattering problem with energy-                independent potentials is equivalent to determining molecular,                  atomic, and nuclear forces in terms of the scattering data                      obtained in collision experiments, and the determination of these               forces is one of the fundamental problems in physics.  The                      inverse scattering problem with energy-dependent potentials is                  equivalent to the determination of the properties of a medium                   using only the measurements made on the boundary; such a problem                has many important applications in wave propagation, seismology,                nondestructive testing, oil exploration, atmospheric profile                    inversion, and other areas.",
