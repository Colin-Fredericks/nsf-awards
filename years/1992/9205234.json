 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether                       variations in the cholesterol content of plasma membranes from                  various cell types of the rainbow trout account for the thermal                 adaptation of membrane function characteristic of these animals                 (i.e., the ability of trout and other cold-blooded animals \u0131those               animals at the same temperature as their environment! to maintain               similar levels of membrane-related activities \u0131such as nutrient and             ion transport! at different body temperatures, even though membrane             structure and function are markedly perturbed by temperature), and              the means by which the cholesterol content of these membranes is                modified in response to temperature change. The results of the                  proposed experiments will provide a broadly applicable definition               of the role of cholesterol in membrane structure and function. The              proposed experiments will determine the effects of growth                       temperature on i) the plasma membrane content of cholesterol; ii)               the distribution of cholesterol between the plasma membrane and                 intracellular stores; iii) the capacity for cholesterol                         biosynthesis in liver and intestine; and iv) rates of cholesterol               transport from its site of synthesis into the plasma membrane. In               addition, the influence of modulation in cholesterol content on                 various membrane functions (membrane fluidity, permeability, and                rates of transport) will be assessed. The rainbow trout is an ideal             animal model in which to address these basic questions in membrane              biology because: 1) trout remain active and behave normally over                a wide range of temperatures, indicating that they acclimate well               to variations in temperature; 2) in marked contrast to homeotherms              (e.g., humans or, more generally, mammals) the membrane lipid                   composition can be readily manipulated in a noninvasive and                     physiologically meaningful context, simply by altering the water                temperature, thus providing a powerful tool for probing the                     relationships between membrane structure and function not available             in higher animals; and 3) the membranes of vertebrate, cold-                    blooded animals are more similar to those of higher vertebrates                 with respect to both lipid composition and diversity than are those             of microorganisms, which have also been extensively employed to                 study this problem.",
