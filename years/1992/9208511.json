Three thrusts are considered:             1) Exploratory synthesis of new nonlinear optic active host                     framework materials; 2) Nonlinear optic active host systems                     generated by selectively induced anisotropic stress coupled with                compositional driven phase instabilities; and 3) Nonlinear optic                nanocomposites synthesized by the self-organization and alignment               of hyperpolarizable atomic and molecular entities on the surface                and within the channels of polar inorganic molecular sieves.                    Exploratory synthesis using hydrothermal, flux, solid state, sol                gel and thin film techniques are proposed along with the use of                 guest/host ion exchange, sorption, and solid state substitution                 chemistry to modify nonlinear optic behavior.  A second objective               of this research is to examine atomic displacements externally                  induced by temperature and pressure and their relation to elecro-               optic related phase changes.  Inclusion guest and host chemistry                can be used to control second harmonic generation response over a               wide range.  The chemistry and characterization needed to better                understand this relationship will be studied and theoretically                  modelled during the proposed funding period and applied to the                  exploratory synthesis of new nonlinear optic materials.",
