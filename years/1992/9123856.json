 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will continue his research on the                    quantum invariants of 3-manifolds, first defined by Witten (in the              context of quantum field theory) and by Reshetikhin and Turaev (in              the context of quantum groups).  The overall objectives of the                  project are:                                                                    1) to study the structure of the known quantum invariants and their             refinements, and to explore possible generalizations;                           2) to study connections between quantum invariants and other 3-                 manifold invariants;                                                            3) to explore the relationship of quantum invariants with number                theory;                                                                         4) to apply quantum invariants to problems in low dimensional                   topology.                                                                            There is a long tradition of mathematicians involving                      themselves in the problems of physics, often to the mutual                      enrichment of both subjects.  Tools are developed to solve physical             problems and then turn out to have much greater generality and                  become widely used in mathematics.  The story of the new quantum                invariants of 3-manifolds is similar.  Mathematicians interesting               themselves in problems of quantum field theory were led to a                    certain geometric construction.  The construction led in turn to an             invariant that depended only on the topological character and not               the full geometric character of the underlying manifold.  There are             now variations on the original construction and numerous resulting              quantum invariants.  Their origin is sufficiently different from                that of other previously known invariants that they can be expected             to detect things the traditional invariants cannot.  It now                     behooves topologists to demonstrate this as well as to sort out the             different quantum invariants and their relationships to more                    traditional invariants.",
