 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors Robert Meyer and Seth Fraden and                 some graduate students of Brandeis University to collaborate                    in studies of colloids and liquid crystals with Professor H. N.                 W. Lekkerkerker and his group of the Chemistry Department of the                University of Utrecht, the Netherlands.  The two groups have                    complementary expertise in the field of liquid crystals (U.S.                   side) and colloids (Dutch side) and have overlapping interests                  in the area of colloids which form liquid crystals.  Joint                      research will be carried out on specialized materials on which                  each of the laboratories is expert, in order to advance                         understanding of these important systems.  For example, the                     Brandeis group has been working recently on filamentous                         bacteriophage viruses that are susceptible to magnetic field                    induced ordering.  The Utrecht group has been able to synthesize                rod-like colloidal particles of the crystal Boehmite, and has                   developed expertise in preparing colloidal particles with                       specialized organic coatings.  These lines of research come                     together in the current collaboration in studies of rod-like                    colloidal particles which form ordered states in suspension in                  a liquid.  The collaborators will experimentally control the                    properties of the colloidal particles and their interaction, and                will make a detailed theoretical analysis of the systems.                                                                                                       The topic of colloids and liquid crystals is one of increasing                  importance, as the field of complex fluids and their                            applications grow.  As well as being interesting in their own                   right, and the basis of many important applications in                          technology and industry, these colloidal systems serve as model                 systems for testing fundamental ideas about many other important                physical systems.",
