 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many natural and man-made media vary randomly                                   in space and time, and therefore electromagnetic,                               optical, and acoustic waves propagating in these                                random media experience random fluctuations in                                  space and time.  Examples are microwave, optical,                               and acoustic wave scattering by ocean waves,                                    atmospheric turbulence, solar wind, rain, fog, snow,                            terrain, vegetation, biological media, composite and                            disordered materials, and rough  surfaces.  These                               interactions between the wave and the random                                    media affect a broad range of practical problems                                such as communications, identifications and remote                              sensing of these media, inverse scattering, and                                 imaging of objects in the medium.  For almost 20                                years, we have been conducting extensive basic                                  research on waves in random media, and we have                                  been successful in making substantial contributions                             in this field.  On the basis of our background and                              experience, we propose to conduct extensive                                     theoretical investigations, numerical studies, and                              controlled laboratory experiments on multiple                                   scattering.  Our objectives are the understanding of                            the physical processes of these multiple scattering                             phenomena and the development of mathematical                                   models useful for practical applications.                                       Our proposed work will be centered on several                                   specific topics including the backscattering                                    enhancement from scatterers and rough surfaces,                                 pulse scattering in particles and rough surfaces,                               lateral and range resolutions, depolarization and                               degree of polarization of scattered waves, higher                               order moments of the scattered wave, vector                                     radiative transfer for dense spherical and                                      nonspherical particles, imaging of objects in random                            media, and application of neural network technique                              to inverse scattering problems.  We propose to                                  conduct carefully controlled optical, millimeter                                wave, and acoustic experiments in order to guide                                the development of the theories.  We also propose                               to conduct extensive numerical Monte Carlo                                      simulations to help construct theoretical models.                               This combination of theoretical, numerical, and                                 experimental studies has proved to be most                                      effective in our research.  These studies encompass                             fundamental research as well as practical                                       applications and should lead to improved or new                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 statistical wave theories which will be useful in                               applications such as atmospheric optics, ocean                                  acoustics, geophysical remote-sensing, radars,lidars,                           ultrasound imaging, optical diffusion in tissues,                               inverse scattering of random media, and disordered                              and composite materials.",
