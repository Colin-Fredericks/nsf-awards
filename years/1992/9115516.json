 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science               research project between Professor Ralph Nicholson, Department                  of Botany and Plant Pathology, Purdue University, and Professor                 Hitoshi Kunoh, Laboratory of Plant Pathology, Mie University,                   Tsu, Japan.  The project will also involve Professor Robert Hanau               of Purdue and two co-investigators from Okayama University in                   Japan, Professors Tomonori Shiraishi and Tetsuji Yamada.  These                 researchers have considerable expertise in diverse areas of plant               pathology.                                                                                                                                                      The subject of this project is Erysiphe graminis, a fungal pathogen             of barley.  Understanding the molecular basis of disease                        interactions and its relationship to changes in plant physiology is             important to both the United States and Japan.  Plant diseases                  represent a significant problem in the production of all food and               fiber crops.  This collaborative research project will expand on                previous work by the investigators to discern the molecular basis of            the peptides released and their influence on the physiology of the              host as well as their importance to the successful                              thigmodifferentiation of the fungus.  Future research will be based             on using the information obtained to elucidate logical control                  strategies based on the better understanding of the infection process           and what specific sites in the process might be considered as targets           in a control scheme.  It is expected that researchers in both                   countries will benefit from this project because it will result in a            new understanding of plant disease caused by obligate pathogens.                It will also bring together researchers with considerable expertise in          diverse areas of plant pathological research.",
