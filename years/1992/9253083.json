 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to improve the quality of science                           instruction in the elementary classroom. The project will                       focus on the development of activities that will improve the                    science content knowledge and pedagogical skills in ten school                  districts in the state of Arkansas. To determine where                          enhancement in science is most needed, an assessment will be                    conducted during the planning period utilizing the teachers,                    science supervisors, principals, superintendents and other key                  personnel in the assessment process. Organizations that impact                  science education will be contacted so that a coordinated                       effort will be made for the development of a science program                    that will have a tremendous impact on science teachers in the                   state of Arkansas.                                                                                                                                              The PI has identified some critical elements of the planning                    activity that will require support, as this is an attempt to                    coordinate a large scale reform of teacher enhancement in                       elementary science education. The project will result in a                      restructuring of science activities for the teachers through                    a full  proposal which will be submitted later for funding.",
