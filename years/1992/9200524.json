 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research employs analytical methods and numerical                     simulations to investigate (in the context of relativistic                      astrophysics) the accretion processes around a black hole                       immersed in an external magnetic field.  The black hole's                       exterior spacetime is modelled by a solution of the combined                    Einstein-Maxwell equations (the magnetized Schwarzschild                        metric).                                                                             Equipotential surfaces and Von Zeipel cylinders of                         relativistic rotating thick disks are analytically                              investigated.  Computer algebra systems will be used to tackle                  some of the cumbersome calculations expected in this part of                    the project.  A numerical approach is also needed in regions                    where the analytical method fails (outside the closed                           potentials).  This numerical approach involves converting the                   relativistic hydrodynamic equations into finite difference                      schemes to be solved on a supercomputer.  Image processing                      techniques and color images will be necessary to interpret the                  numerical output.                                                                    One important aim of the project is to involve                             undergraduate science majors in research experiences.  This                     project will provide talented students with the opportunity                     for planning, carrying out, and reporting scientific research.                  Moreover, by using advanced computational tools, they will                      develop computing skills needed for their future advancement                    in science or engineering.",
