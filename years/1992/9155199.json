 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) plans to                        establish a Trainer-of-Trainers Center and a state-wide                         network of six Teacher Development Centers (TDC) in Colorado.                   Each center will be a collaborative partnership involving a                     university, Cooperative Educational Services, a regional                        branch of the Colorado Alliance for Science, and several                        school districts.  The project design, which is consistent                      with the Colorado plan for the State Systemic Initiative, has                   four major components: 1) the teacher development network, 2)                   the trainer-of-trainers program, 3) the master-teacher                          program, and 4) the school-based teacher development program.                   During the 60-month period for which NSF funding is sought,                     project staff will build a network to provide teacher                           development and follow-up implementation support for 540                        master teachers and at least 1,080 additional classroom                         teachers of grades 4-6 (48,600 students).                                                                                                                       Four staff members from each of the six regional Teacher                        Development Centers (the Center director, the project                           evaluator, a master teacher, and an administrator) will be                      trained at the Trainer-of-Trainers Center.  Each of these six                   teams will then develop and implement plans for the                             improvement of science education via the regional Teacher                       Development Center (TDC) in their respective regions.  Each                     TDC will offer a series of courses on science and science                       teaching for the master teachers from their region.  The                        master teachers will be involved in an intensive, long-term                     program to improve their science teaching and that of their                     colleagues.  Teacher development networks will provide follow-                  up support to the master teachers as they implement                             improvements in their science curriculum and instruction.                                                                                                       This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because of its systemic plan to enhance in a                            substantive way the science teaching of a large number of                       elementary school teachers throughout the state of Colorado.                                                                                                    Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 163% of the amount                        requested from NSF.",
