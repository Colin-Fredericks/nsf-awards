Model-based Group Decision Support:  The Impact of Shared  Simulation Models and Tailorable Information Viewing on Group  Decision Making Outcomes and Processes             This is the third year funding of a three-year continuing  award.  Simulation models can be useful decision aids for many  kinds of problems, and have been incorporated into Decision Support  Systems for single users.  But many important problems require  group decision making, and effective ways of making simulation  models available to groups need to be developed.  This research  evaluates the usefulness of computer simulation models in group  policy negotiations, using laboratory and real-world tasks in the  domain of river basin management.  It compares five different modes  of model access during negotiations, ranging from no access at all  to free access controlled by the group of negotiators as a whole.   Since different negotiators in a group typically have interests in   different aspects of a policy decision this research explores the   usefulness of permitting negotiators to create tailored views of   model results, so that they can quickly evaluate the impact of a   policy alternative on their particular interests.  Tailored views   may exclude unimportant data and may compute and present useful   transformations of raw model results.  The results of the proposed   studies should be of direct value in exploiting advances in   computer simulation technology and user interface design in support  of group policy negotiations.",
