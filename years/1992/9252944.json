 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data sets--one primarily on women in a study of publicly                  funded housing, and a second on the \"hidden homeless,\" who are                  primarily men, will be provided by the host institution, and will be            used to examine:  1) how men's and women's responses to                         destitution vary; and 2) the range of strategies women and men                  use to survive destitution, the relationship among those strategies,            changes over time in their use, and their consequences for various              aspects of well-being.  Appropriate data analytic techniques--both              qualitative and quantitative--will be used to compare women and                 men as well as to make comparisons among different groups of                    women.                                                                                The proposed research will examine survival strategies in                 the face of destitution, especially as they are shaped by gender.                     This project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                   opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    collaboration with an ongoing project at the Institute, a seminar for           graduate students, mentoring individual graduate research                       assistants, consulting with undergraduates in the Honors College,               as well as presenting talks to both the Department of Sociology                 and other units on campus.",
