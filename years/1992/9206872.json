 "awd_abstract_narration": "During gastrulation the embryo undergoes a dramatic reorganization,             as massive morphogenetic movements and tissue differentiation                   result in the formation of patterned structures arrayed along the               body axis.  The cells that participate in morphogenesis at the                  gastrula stage must presumably \"read out\" information regarding                 their position along the axes of the forming embryo, and use that               information as they produce patterned structures.  Dr. Harden's                 laboratory has focused on pattern formation during gastrulation in              a seemingly simple system, the sea urchin embryo, in order to                   discover general rules that all embryos use to produce patterned                structures during gastrulation.  Using experimental approaches that             are unique to this system, we have found that mesenchyme cells in               that sea urchin embryo form patterned structures in response to                 spatially localized target information in the ectoderm or                       underlying basal lamina.  This proposal is aimed at gaining a                   greater understanding of these target recognition events, using                 molecular biology, computer-enhanced imaging techniques, and                    classical embryology.  Specifically, this proposal seeks to answer              the following questions: (1) What is the nature of the interaction              between cells and their targets? (2) When and how do these targets              arise during development? (3) What is the molecular nature of these             targets? Our long term goal is to understand the rules that cells               use to interact with one another in a coordinated fashion to                    transform the structure of the embryo during gastrulation.",
