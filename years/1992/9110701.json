 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past twenty years at least seventy different chemical                  compounds have been detected from interstellar gas.  The                        overwhelming majority of these molecules have been identified on                the basis of their rotational spectra, which for the most part were             measured in the laboratory prior to their observation with radio                telescopes.  Successful observation and identification of                       interstellar molecules have therefore been accomplished through the             symbiotic relationship of radio astronomy and high resolution                   molecular spectroscopy in the laboratory.                                                                                                                       Dr. Ziurys will use this award to initiate a new research program               which will combine her observational work with a supporting                     laboratory effort.  The laboratory work will enable her to measure              the rotational spectra, and hence rest frequencies, of potential                new interstellar molecules.  The species to be studied are those                likely to be associated with high temperatures in interstellar                  clouds.  These include molecules of silicon, magnesium, iron,                   aluminum, and calcium.  This award is made under the Research                   Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award program at the                 NSF.",
