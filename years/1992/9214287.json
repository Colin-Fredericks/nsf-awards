The advent of research                               activities requiring environmental controls has                                 overtaxed the electrical system of the building.                                Neither the capacity nor the reliability of the                                 existing electrical distribution system is                                      commensurate with the needs of modern science.                                  Appropriate temperature and humidity control                                    equipment will be installed in laboratories,                                    instrumentation rooms, faculty/student research                                 and research training areas.  A state-of-the-art                                electronic energy management system will be                                     installed and integrated with existing systems,                                 and insulation will be added to the roof and attic                              of the building.  Walk-in refrigeration facilities                              will be upgraded.  An existing dumbwaiter will be                               converted to a passenger elevator to provide                                    handicapped access.                                                                  The provision of an adequate electrical                                    distribution system will permit the continued                                   installation and use of new instrumentation, with                               appropriate environmental controls.  Air                                        conditioning will be installed to provide an                                    appropriate environment for equipment and                                       researchers.  Summer research opportunities for                                 sophomores and juniors will be offered as well as                               provision of in-service training for teachers and                               special summer modules to stimulate interest among                              high school students in the natural sciences.",
