Project funding will enable Dr.              Haluk Sucuoglu of METU to participate in a data collection survey               on the behavior of window glass panels during earthquakes in both               the U.S. and Europe, especially Turkey; he will then spend three                months in the laboratory of Dr. C.V.G. Vallabhan at Texas Tech                  University jointly interpreting the survey data and developing the              mathematical model.  The research will continue when Dr. Sucuoglu               returns to METU; Dr. Vallabhan will travel to METU and spend one                month with Dr. Sucuoglu to complete the project.  This project is               important because understanding and predicting the dynamic load                 properties of window glass panels during earthquakes has widespread             implications for construction planning and safety.                                                                                                              This project in structural systems and construction processes                   fulfills the program objective in advancing scientific knowledge by             enabling leading experts in the United States and Turkey to combine             complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of                   strong mutual interest and competence.",
