 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of ten U.S. researchers in            a joint seminar on \"Enhanced Thermal Contact Conductance in                     Microelectronics,\" to be held in Melbourne, Australia, March 1992.              Dr. T. Nejat Veziroglu, Director of the Clean Energy Research                   Institute, University of Miami, will chair the seminar.  Co-                    chairpersons will be Dr. John W. Sheffield, University of Missouri-             Rolla, and Dr. Arthur Williams, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria,           Australia.  The seminar takes place under the U.S.-Australia                    Cooperative Science Program.                                                                                                                                    Thermal contact conductance plays an important role in many practical           applications where heat transfer is a significant operational                   factor.  Examples are to be found in microelectronic devices, rotating          machinery, cryogenic fluid containers, the fuel-cladding interface              in nuclear fission reactors, and aircraft structural joints subject             to aerodynamic heating.  For cooling microelectronic devices, most              research has been on improving active convective systems for                    removing heat, such as cooling jets and through-flow.  However, new             technologies developed for the application of thin films offer                  opportunities for utilizing thermal conductance as a means of                   transporting heat away from \"hot spots\" in electronic and other                 systems.  U.S. and Australian scientists and engineers are among                those doing significant research in thermal contact conductance.                Participants at this seminar will share their research results in               this field, describe various novel surface preparation techniques               (such as metallic vapor deposition onto contact surfaces) to                    optimize surface heat transfer behavior, discuss applications to                microelectronics and other technological areas of industrial                    importance, and make recommendations regarding future cooperative               research activities that should prove mutually beneficial.  A one-              volume report of the proceedings will be prepared that will give                broader dissemination of the information presented at the seminar.",
