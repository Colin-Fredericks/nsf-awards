 "awd_abstract_narration": "Public authority in the United States is at a particularly low ebb.             This has not always been so.  Well into the nineteenth century, the             United States had a much more popular and participatory public life             than it does now, and public attitudes toward public authority were             more positive.  This project seeks to understand how and why this               change has taken place through an examination of the origins of                 public authority.  The project will examine the shaping of public               authority in one city (Philadelphia) during the nineteenth century              since the local level is where the discussion, debate, and                      development of public authority took place.  The data for the study             includes records from the court and prison dockets, grand jury                  presentments, annual reports of municipal agencies, and record                  books from various public and social service agencies as well as                newspapers, popular literature, and the papers of jurists and                   lawyers.  The project will concentrate on how an understanding of               public authority was manifested in the activities of local                      institutions, including local courts, and the circumstances of its              transformation as manifested in struggles over criminal law,                    education, public services, and social services.                                                                                                                Although there have been a number of studies of the formation of                the American state, few have illuminated aspects of public                      authority below the level of the state and federal governments.                 Most historians have explained the peculiarity of public authority              in the United States by emphasizing its weakness relative to the                market and demonstrating how private economic interests have                    determined public authority and policy.  This research offers a new             perspective in concentrating on localism and non-market authority               in the legal, social, institutional, and intellectual aspects of                public life.  Results of the research will add substantially to                 our understanding of the institutional structure and behavior of                American law in the post World War II era.  From a practical                    standpoint, such an understanding is becoming increasingly                      important because of both the pressing problems faced by public                 authority in the United States and the democratic revolutions                   sweeping through much of the world.",
