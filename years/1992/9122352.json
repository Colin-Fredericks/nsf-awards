Holmes of                   the Chemistry Department, University of Massachusetts at                        Amherst, for the investigation of high valent silicon and                       phosphorus compounds.  Anionic, hexacoordinated silicon                         compounds will be prepared and their characteristics will be                    compared to analogous phosphorus compounds.  Acyclic, pentaoxy,                 anionic silicates will be studied in order to understand more                   concerning the initial steps in silanol polymerization.  The                    structure and conformational properties of pentacoordinte                       phosphorus and silicon compunds containing rings varying in                     size from 6- to 8- membered will be studied, particularly as                    relevant to cAMP mechanisms.  Also to be investigated is the                    mechanistic pathway for nucleophilic displacement reactions of                  tetracoordinate phosphorus and silicon.  A wide range of tools                  will be used to characterize the compounds, including variable                  temperature NMR, X-ray diffraction, and molecular modeling.                     %%%                                                                             Only recently has it become possible to compare the behavior of                 silicon compounds with five or six groups attached to silicon                   to the behavior of analogous phosphorus compounds.  By                          comparing the details of reactions in which such compounds                      rearrange or lose the fifth or sixth group, it is possible to                   understand more about how spatial and electronic factors affect                 the chemistry of these compounds.  This fundamental research                    project may help provide insight into the formation of silicon                  polymers or into the hydrolysis of nucleoside cyclic                            3',5'-monophosphates, which play a central role in the                          regulation of cell metabolism.",
