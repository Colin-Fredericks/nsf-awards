 "awd_abstract_narration": "Local polymer dynamics in solution will be investigated using                   Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxation measurements, time-                 resolved optical experiments, and computer simulations.  NMR                    measurements will be used to investigate the nonlinear dependence               of local polymer motions upon the solvent viscosity in dilute                   solution.  These results will be combined with solvent rotation                 measurements to test a new hypothesis about the origin of the                   solvent modification effect first noted in viscoelastic studies.                Both optical and NMR experiments will be used to systematically                 explore the microscopic friction of polymer solutions on varying                length scales.  Computer simulations will provide new insights into             the fundamental nature of local polymer dynamics.  The cooperative              motion of torsional angles, atomic positions , and other degrees of             freedom will be examined.  The simulations can be critically tested             by the NMR measurements.  Together these studies will allow the                 investigators to address the relationship between molecular                     structure and local dynamics, the interaction of solvent and                    polymer motions, and the connection between local and global                    polymer motions.                                                                                                                                                This research deals with a fundamental investigation of dynamic                 properties of polymer molecules that are different from those found             in molecules of other materials.  Hence, the research is                        fundamental, but of potential significance in technology, (i.e.,                for viscosity and rubber elasticity).",
