 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Junior Advanced Laboratory at Princeton University is the                   core experimental course for physics majors.  A major overhaul                  currently underway, seeks to replace some old experiments with                  new ones, and to upgrade the instrumentation in the rest.  A                    significant fraction of the new experiments relate to                           techniques of modern optics or the detection of photons.  They                  have acquired two charge coupled device (CCD) cameras that are                  greatly facilitating the implementation of these experiments.                   (Some of these would not be possible without the CCD.)  In                      three of these experiments, the CCD is being used with a                        spectrometer and a home-built pulsed nitrogen laser which pumps                 a dye laser.  An introduction to the important technique of                     hole-burning transient spectroscopy is being offered in                         Experiment 1.  In Experiment 2, students are being introduced                   to modern non-linear optics by performing four-wave phase                       conjugation in sodium vapor.  The CCD detector greatly                          facilitates tuning of the pump lasers to the sodium transition                  lines.  The third optics experiment demonstrates the phenomenon                 of Raman scattering in water.  The capability of simultaneously                 capturing the full Raman spectrum in a CCD array makes this                     experiment feasible in an undergraduate lab.  Resonance-                        enhanced Raman scattering will also be used to study dilute                     concentrations of hemoglobin in solution.  Experiment 4 uses a                  CCD camera to record the orbits of the moons of Jupiter, and to                 measure their periods and orbit radii.  The last experiment                     demonstrates the interference of a single photon with itself in                 generating the classic Young interference pattern.  Although                    photographic film is competitive with the CCD detector, the                     latter is much more versatile and better suited for an                          instructional laboratory setting.",
