 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous research on threshold methods and extreme values is               in the process of being extended from the case of univariate time               series, to multivariate or spatial data.  This is particularly                  relevant in climatological research because of the need to                      combine data from many measuring stations.  The climatological                  objective is to come up with measures of trend among the                        crossings by a temperature series of a very high or very low                    threshold.  A second objective is to look at alternatives to the                standard models for time series.  In particular the concept of                  long-range dependence appears to be important in climatology, and               the research will explore methods of measuring this from the low-               frequency behavior of the periodogram.                                               An important theme of current climate research is the need                 for reliable statistical measures of greenhouse-gas-induced                     climate change.  Global warming would cause an increase in                      extreme temperatures.  This research will study the statistical                 aspects of these extreme values, paying particular attention to                 the problem of efficiently combining information from a number of               measuring stations.",
