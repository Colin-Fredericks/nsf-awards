 "awd_abstract_narration": "In science and mathematics education, leaders agree that                        instruction needs to focus more on understanding than                           coverage.  There is little evidence however that teachers or                    test makers do much directly to promote such higher order                       thinking.  To overcome this problem we will work with a high-                   stakes test maker to develop outcome measures of higher order                   thinking; assist a group of science and mathematics teachers                    in preparing assessment strategies which can be used to                         promote higher order thinking in their classrooms; study the                    effects of those strategies on student performance using the                    developed outcome measures and a related high stakes measure;                   and develop a teacher assessment inservice package which                        illustrates and explains sample classroom assessment                            strategies that promote higher order thinking.  The one year                    funding allows completion of steps one and two above.                                                                                                           If test makers see that higher order thinking is being                          promoted in the classroom they will emphasize such thinking in                  their high-stakes test development.",
