 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project under the direction of Dr. Thomas                 DeFanti, U of Illinois at Chicago.  Faculty, staff and graduate                 students at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications                 in Champaign-Urbana and the Electronic Visualization Laboratory                 in Chicago have been actively working with discipline scientists                to develope prototype software and user interfaces for doing                    remote computational science and visualization.  The High                       Performance Computing and Communication Visualization Project                   (HPCCV) is a combined exhibit and theater area designed for                     demonstrating computing, communications and visualization.  The                 project is a human resources and technology transfer project, one               that transfers computer science methods to the field of                         Computational science and one that aims to aggressively drive the               acceptance of this methodology by showcasing real applications.                 HPCCV will demonstrate what it is like for scientists and                       engineers to have gigaflop-per-second computing brought to the                  desktop on light fiber.  The exhibit will be displayed at                       \"SIGGRAPH '92 at McCormick Place in Chicago on July 28-30, 1992.                High speed networking within the exhibit and to the NSFnet will                 tie vector and parallel supercomputers all over the nation to the               SIGGRAPH 92 exhibits floor.  FDDI, HiPPI and TC technology will                 be extensively explored and utilized.  The exhibit will also be                 displayed at Supercomputing 92 in the fall of this year.",
