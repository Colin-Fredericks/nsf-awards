 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study consists of a series of experiments testing                     different models for the determination of power in social                       exchange networks.   The experiments will be set up so that it is               possible to test the effects of nine different types of social                  networks on the exchange that occurs among individuals in the                   networks.  Networks are different in size, in the number and                    direction of exchanges which can be made, in the values                         associated with an exchange between two individuals, and in the                 alternatives available outside the network.  In the experiments,                subjects will be playing a game where the object is to agree with               one or more other players on how to divide points between them.                 These points can later be exchanged with money.  Depending on the               type of network a subject is in and on his or her location in                   that network, one player may have more power than others because                he or she can negotiate with more players, have alternatives for                gaining points from outside the network, or because he or she is                forced to trade with certain other players in order to earn any                 reward.  The experiments provide tests of competing hypotheses                  about the effects of such structural conditions on the actions                  and decisions of the participants in the experiment.                                 Although this study is experimental, and thus highly                       abstract, the results will improve our understanding of the ways                in which social structures differ in the power embedded in                      different positions in a given social structure and how that in                 turn influences individual actors behavior and decisions.",
