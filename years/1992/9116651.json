 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research              project between Professor Wojbor Woyczynski, Center for                         Stochastic and Chaotic Processes in Science and Technology,                     Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve                  University, Cleveland, and Professor Tadahisa Funaki, Department                of Mathematics, Nagoya University.  The purpose is to establish a               sustained, direct cooperation in the area of hydrodynamic limits and            nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations between the two             centers in the United States and Japan.  Other investigators involved           in the project are Professor Peter Kotelenez, Department of                     Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve University, and                Professor Kohei Uchiyama, Department of Applied Physics, Tokyo                  Institute of Technology, and Professor Hideo Nagai, Department of               Mathematics, Nagoya University.                                                                                                                                 The objective of the research is to develop a broad spectrum of                 techniques in the area of stochastic models for physically relevant             phenomena, in particular in the areas of physical chemistry and                 geophysical fluid dynamics and oceanography,  The analysis,                     prediction and identification of the models would be based on                   statistical, mechanical, and probabilistic techniques that take into            account microscopic and mezoscopic behavior of interacting particle             systems to obtain, in the thermodynamic or hydrodynamic limits,                 the macroscopic behavior as described by kinetic often nonlinear                partial differential equations.  The project will bring together the            different techniques developed by the U.S. and Japanese scientists              that will permit development of new techniques that utilize the best            parts of the two approaches.",
