 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research integrates ideas from artificial intelligence                  (AI) and coordination theory to develop a Virtual Design Team                   VDT)-an object-oriented, discrete event, computer simulation                    model of the flow of decisions and information among participants               in complex, multi-disciplinary design projects.  Conducting                     controlled experiments in real organizations to assess the                      performance of alternative coordination structures is both                      expensive and fraught with practical difficulties.  Compounding                 this, powerful computer simulation tools to analyze the                         performance of organization structures by simulation-analogous to               finite element models for simulating structural behavior-have not               yet been developed.  The VDT addresses this need by using  AI                   techniques to model how the organizational structure of, and the                information processing technologies used by, managers in a                      multi-disciplinary project design team effect the richness,                     volume and timing of information passing among team members.  The               long range goal of this work is to provide a computerized                       analysis tool that can help researchers and practitioners analyze               the performance of organizations.  The first phase of the project               will model the impact of organizational structure and information               processing technologies on task duration.  The second phase will                extend the model to capture the impacts of organization structure               and information technologies on design quality and reliability.",
