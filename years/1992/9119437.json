 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Buss and Ruddle propose to initiate a research program                     directed at the resolution of the metazoan phyla. The current                   state of metazoan phylogeny is one of considerable uncertainty,                 with morphological and molecular data sets supporting conflicting               hypotheses. They suggest that examination of Antp-class homeobox                genes will prove capable of resolving the principle                             uncertainties. The extreme conservation of sequence of homeoboxes               and their distinctive pattern of genomic organization provide an                abundance of characters ideal for higher level phylogenetic                     analysis. In this proposal, they will re-examine the relationship               between annelids and arthropods by characterization of the                      genomic diversity, organization, and sequences of homeoboxes from               crustaceans, chelicerates, arachnids, molluscs, onychophorans,                  and annelids. Combined with the growing existing database on                    homeoboxes in cnidarians, nematodes, uniramians, echinoderms and                chordates, this work holds the realistic promise of resolving not               only the annelid-arthropod relationship, but also of shedding                   light on the relationships within and between the most speciose                 protostome and deuterostome phyla. The use of the homeobox system               for phylogenetic analysis is particularly compelling because                    these genes have proved to be central components of the                         regulatory networks involved in early embryonic pattern formation               and specification of cell fate. Thus, as our understanding of the               molecular genetics of development grows, it is likely that the                  information generated in the progress of this research will                     permit study of the origin of the developmental novelty. To                     accomplish these goals it will require the collaboration of                     developmental geneticists and evolutionary biologists.",
