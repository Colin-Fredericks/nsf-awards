The objectives of this program are to                       recognize the nation's most outstanding and promising women                     scientists and engineers in academic careers in research and                    teaching, to retain them in academia, and to facilitate the                     further development of their careers.                                                                                                                           This award will allow the investigator to pursue two important                  projects.  The first involves the investigation of three major                  questions in the area of industrial organization, making use of                 the wealth of data created by airline regulation and the policy                 shock created by deregulation in 1978.  The questions to be                     analyzed are: (1) What is the extent of price discrimination and                how is it affected by market structure?  (2) What determines                    firms' product quality choices?  and (3) How does entry into                    markets affect competitive interactions and what does this reveal               about theories of oligopoly behavior?                                                                                                                           The second project will explore the impact of government risk                   management on firms in the financial service sector.  The                       questions to be analyzed include  (1) What managerial objectives                do financial service firms pursue? and (2) How did the increased                competition resulting from the regulatory reforms and technology                changes of the late 1970's and early 1980's affect bank and                     thrift portfolio risk strategies?  This research will develop                   empirical models of firm's risk preference behavior that will be                interest both to scholars studying firm behavior and to policy                  makers interested in designing effective government risk                        management strategies.",
