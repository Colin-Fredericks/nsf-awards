 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paleomagnetic study of the Albian Contessa section (Umbria,                Italy) has defined several intervals of reversed characteristic                 remanent magnetizations (ChRM) carried by high unblocking-                      temperature hematite within the Cretaceous Normal Polarity                      Superchron.  The reversed intervals correspond with 2 reddish zones             (pigmentary hematite) found throughout Umbria which may reflect the             oxidation state of the seafloor during deposition.  The reversed                ChRM may represent a remagnetization acquired 18 m.y. after                     deposition in reversed polarity chron 33R (or later).  If a                     remagnetization, the process is of great interest since it can                  produce remagnetization patterns which resemble polarity intervals.             Alternatively, the reversed ChRM may record intervals of reversed               geomagnetic field polarity acquired during intense seafloor                     oxidation episodes during the mid-Albian (107-104 Ma).  If correct,             several of the intervals are of sufficient duration (>100 kyr) to               be of use in magnetostratigraphic studies and might provide markers             on oceanic crust of the Cretaceous Quiet Zone.  If primary, the                 intervals also suggest a modification of models of geomagnetic                  reversal frequency.                                                                  Recently, 2 zones of reddish, hematite-bearing sediments were              also identified in the Albian Breggia section (Switzerland).  The               reddish zones may have more than a regional significance; they may              mark rapid changes in paleoceanographic conditions analogous to                 (but opposite in oxidation) to the Cretaceous global anoxic events.             Paleomagnetic data suggest the presence of reversed ChRMs from the              Breggia sediments from which we can exclude a remagnetization                   scenario calling upon circulating fluids affecting only a portion               of the measured sections.  Reactivation of a preexisting mineral                phase, however, is another remagnetization mechanism which is                   presently being considered.  Nevertheless, the funding of reversed              ChRMs in a stratigraphically narrow interval at well-separated                  sites gives further support to a primary magnetization model.                        We propose an extension of our studies to a reference section              in Italy and the deep sea (ODP) aimed at characterizing the                     paleoclimate signature of the mid-Albian sediments through rock-                magnetic and cyclostratigraphic (bedding and geochemical)                       measurements.  First, we hope to determine the nature, duration and             extent of the oxidized intervals.  Second, we hope to use these                 data as a means to examine critically the lock-in mechanism of the              remanent components of magnetization observed in the Albian (and                other) pelagic sediments.",
