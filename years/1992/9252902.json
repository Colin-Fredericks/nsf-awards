The project will have several kinds                     of product:                                                                                                                                                       o  assessment packages for each of three grade ranges that                    exemplify national goals and related state guidelines - high                    quality, practicality, and balance in terms of nationally                       agreed curriculum objectives for mathematics (e.g. those in                     the two volumes of NCTM Standards);                                             o  explicit curriculum support, including both classroom                        materials and professional development resources, to                            facilitate the transition, enabling typical teachers to                         prepare their students to tackle effectively what are                           initially new kinds of task before they take on                                 comprehensive new curricula;                                                    o  active collaborative links between the assessment                            designers and those concerned with the design and delivery                      of curricula -- national curriculum development projects,                       the professional associations, states and others who have                       similar curriculum objectives; and                                              o  a driving force for curriculum enhancement through the                       pressures on the curriculum generated by this assessment,                       which will forward national curriculum objectives.                                                                                                              These products will be developed at three national sites (in                    California, Massachusetts, and Michigan) and the Shell                          Centre, in active collaboration with NSF-supported                              curriculum projects and the related State Departments of                        Education.",
