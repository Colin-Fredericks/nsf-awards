The                  courses goals are twofold: to provide students an opportunity                   to apply the methodological skills and substantive knowledge                    which they have acquired in previous coursework in the                          discipline and to hone their analytical and critical skills, so                 that they can compete more effectively for seats in graduate                    school and positions in the private and public sector.  A key                   audience of the course is African-American students, who                        presently comprise 20% of the majors.",
