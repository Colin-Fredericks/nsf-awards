 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan Cooperative                       Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Research Program project between                 Professor Ronald Christensen, Department of Chemistry, Bowdoin                  College, Brunswick, Maine, and Professor Keitaro Yoshihara,                     Department of Electronic Structure, Institute for Molecular                     Science, Okazaki, Japan.  The collaboration will focus on the                   spectroscopy and dynamics of the S1 and S2 excited states of                    simple tetraenes and trienes in supersonic molecular beams.  The                goal is to obtain a more detailed understanding of                              photoisomerization in phototypical polyene systems.                                                                                                             This project to study the electronic spectra of polyenes involves               cooperative experiments between scientists with complementary                   skills and facilities.  Their studies using fluorescence and                    fluorescence excitation techniques promise to make substantial                  contributions to ongoing research and will complement other                     methods based on multiphoton ionization.  Professor Christensen                 will travel to Okazaki to purify his compounds there and will                   participate in the conduct and interpretation of the spectroscopic              experiments.",
