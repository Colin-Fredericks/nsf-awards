 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the problem of                                   system design in an Hoo sense for interconnected                                and slowly time-varying systems.  The project starts                            with the modification of the Hoo method so that the                             effect of interaction among coupled subsystems can                              be incorporated into the design.  In particular, we                             will develop a design strategy which exploits the                               available design freedom contained in Hoo method                                to achieve coordination of subsystems.                                          Furthermore, we will investigate the design tradeoff                            and limits on achievable performance in Hoo design                              of interconnected systems.  The project continues to                            study the problem of stabilization and optimization                             in continuous-time slowly time-varying (possibly                                unstable) systems containing possibly time-varying                              delay terms.  The frozen-time approach will be                                  employed to derive practical design procedures, and                             will be examined for its limitations.  The local-                               global double algebra framework developed by the                                Principal Investigator and Zames will be used to                                study rigorously the issues of stabilization and                                optimization in slowly time-varying systems.  We                                will concentrate on the following fundamental issues                            in Hoo design problems for slowly time-varying                                  systems: (1) the development of analysis tools for                              robust stability and performance, (2) the                                       construction of feedback controllers, (3) the power                             of adaptation as compared with general time-                                    varying system design, and (4) the limits of                                    achievable performance imposed by plant dynamics.                               The project will be of practical importance in                                  providing constructive design tools, and of                                     theoretical significance in giving a better                                     understanding of the limitations of the frozen-time                             approach and adaptation, and the relationships                                  between modeling and design.",
