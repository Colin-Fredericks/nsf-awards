Langdon, Department of Materials Science, University of                         Southern California (USC), to pursue with Dr. Ho Chul                           Kim, Professor of Physics, Korea Advanced Institute of                          Science and Technology (KAIST), for 24 months, a program                        of cooperative research on the application of non-                              destructive techniques to the investigation of                                  cavitation in superplasticity.  Their research formerly                         was supported under NSF Grant No. INT-8803709.  These                           scientists and members of their research groups will                            continue their collaboration through the use of                                 destructive superplastic testing, at USC, with non-                             destructive ultrasonic velocity and photoacoustic                               spectroscopy (PAS) at KAIST.  They will (1) use                                 metallography, at USC to verify PAS results obtained at                         KAIST, (2) extent their procedures to include lower                             elongations, and (3) expand their investigations to                             include materials other than metals.                                                                                                                            Superplasticity refers to the ability of some metals to                         exhibit exceptionally high, neck-free elongations, often                        in excess of 1,000%, when pulled in tension at elevated                         temperatures.  This phenomenon is of considerable                               commercial interest because  of the many potential                              applications in sheet-metal forming.  A major problem in                        superplasticity is the nucleation and growth of internal                        cavities.  These cavities may lead to a significant                             degradation of the post-forming properties of the                               material.  It is important, therefore, to estimate the                          volume of cavities, non-destructively, and to verify                            these estimates using metallographic techniques.  The                           collaborators are highly respected scientists in the                            field of this research.  Their past collaboration has                           resulted in significant contributions to the literature                         of this field.  The U.S. scientist will benefit from                            access to facilities for non-destructive testing,                               available at KAIST, but not at USC.  This project is                            relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative                        Science Program which seeks to increase the level of                            cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and                              engineers through the exchange of scientific                                    information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                          collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean                            participation in the project is supported by the Korea                          Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).",
