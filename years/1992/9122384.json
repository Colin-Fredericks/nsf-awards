 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the technological                    implications of globalization.  Globalization is defined as a two               pronged process moving toward the creation of a world-wide                      integrated economy.  This process consists of the integration of                factor and commodity markets and the international coordination                 of economic policies necessitated by global environmental                       problems, the growing need for product standards, and ever                      tighter macroeconomic linkages.  Globalization affects all stages               of technological creativity-- initial invention, survival, and                  diffusion.  The over arching theme of this project is extremely                 important because it focuses on the issue of how globalization                  might affect the rate of invention, the diversity of new                        inventions, their likely survival, and their diffusion.                                                                                                         The research will first develop evolutionary models of decreasing               diversity that draw directly on the growing literature that                     recognizes technological change as an evolutionary process.  An                 historical analysis of the relation between institutions and                    technological change suggests that a certain level of inter-                    economy competitiveness is essential for the preservation of                    technological creativity.  The second part of the project will                  analyze the history of technology after 1871 from this point of                 view.  Third, the project will focus on the political economy of                technological progress by describing and analyzing resistance to                it, using both historical and simulation techniques.  This                      research is likely to suggest that a multitude of competitive                   economies is the best guarantee against such resistance.  How                   globalization might affect this resistance will also be analyzed.",
