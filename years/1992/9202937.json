 "awd_abstract_narration": "Year to year variations in the number of fish which survive the                 first year of life (termed recruitment or year class strength) are              often sufficient to control the success or failure of the fishery               a few years later.  Despite the scientific and economic benefits                which would result if year class strength could be estimated before             fish reached a marketable size, recruitment prediction has proved               to be an elusive goal.                                                                                                                                          Likely mechanisms contributing to year-to-year variations in the                year class strength of Atlantic croaker include variations in the               location and timing of spawning, the age and date of subsequent                 advection to the estuarine nursery area, the duration and relative              growth rate while in the estuary, and the age and date of migration             of the estuary as an adult. In conjunction with age-structured                  measures of growth and survival based on otolith daily growth                   rings, this project will test these hypotheses using a new laser-               based elemental analysis technique (LS-ICPMS) to retroactively                  determine the hatching site and estimate the age and date of                    subsequent migrations in individual fish.  The technique is based               on the acellular nature of the fish otolith (earstone), which forms             through the concentric daily additions of mineralized tissue around             a central nucleus.  Given the fact that the elemental composition               of a given daily ring reflects the elemental composition of the                 water which passed through the fish's gills on that same day,                   migration between water masses at some age and/or date will be                  recorded as a change in the elemental composition of the otolith at             the appropriate daily increment.  By corollary, water mass                      differences at the time and place of hatching will be reflected in              elemental composition differences in the otolith nucleus.                                                                                                       At present there are few (if any) markers of marine fish                        populations, let alone indicators of past movement and water mass               association.  Successful completion of this project has                         implications not only for recruitment predication of Atlantic                   croaker, but for studies of recruitment, stock structure, migration             and fisheries management around the world.",
