 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Turkana Basin of Kenya and Ethiopia has long been known                as a critical locality for the understanding of vertebrate                      evolution in East Africa.  The geologic record of the basin spans               a broad range, including Cretaceous through Holocene sediments with             intercalated volcanics.  Cretaceous through Oligocene history has               yet to be characterized, but Miocene to Holocene strata are well-               known.  They record the stratigraphic evolution of the basin from               a volcanically active, localized sediment trap, to an integrated                fluvial basin with periodic lacustrine phases, and finally to a                 structurally-controlled rift basin.  Research over the past decade              on the context of vertebrate evolution in the basin has greatly                 altered our perspective on the history of the region and                        development of the East African Rift.  Within the stratigraphic and             temporal framework established for vertebrate studies, it is now                possible to examine in detail the evolution of the region in terms              of its volcanic, tectonic and sedimentary history, and to                       reevaluate the history of geologic processes in this portion of                 Africa.  We intend to focus our attention on the unstudied southern             portion of the Turkana Basin, and to investigate exposures in the               Loiyengalani region, the Chalbi Desert, on Mt. Kulal, and in the                Suguta and Kerio Valleys.  Understanding of the geologic record                 from these regions is critical to evaluating the history of major               geologic events in the basin, including basin integration,                      hydrographic connections, and structural development.",
