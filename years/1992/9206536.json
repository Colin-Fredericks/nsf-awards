 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plasma physics of the magnetopause is the central                      problem of magnetospheric research and our proposed impulsive                   penetration process is truly innovative in the sense that it                    (i) provides solar wind plasma onto closed field lines in the                   boundary layer in sufficient quantities to drive magnetospheric                 and auroral processes, and (ii) changes the state of                            interconnection between interplanetary and geomagnetic field                    lines.  We intend to proceed along three approaches in our                      research effort: (i) Particle simulation. We plan to cooperate                  with others on computer simulation, notably Dr. H. Okuda from                   Princeton University.  He is doing state-of-the-art computer                    simulation of the physics of the magnetopause. (ii) A test                      particle approach.  Starting from M. Gorton's model,                            perturbations of the magnetopause will allow us to calculate the                inductive electric field and the magnetopause currents. (iii)                   Analysis of Experimental Data. Finally, we plan to take the                     September 6, 1981 event as a primary test case for the theory and               modeling.  On that unique occasion, DE-1 went outside the                       magnetopause during a period of very high magnetospheric                        compression while DE-2 traversed the foot of the field line on                  several orbits.  Either a clear disconfirmation of the impulsive                penetration process or a clear confirmation of it would be very                 important for advancing magnetopause physics.",
