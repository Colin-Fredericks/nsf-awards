 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ontogeny and genetic variation are two topics that are thought to               be crucial for our understanding of patterns and processes of                   evolutionary change.  Although the basic concepts for the study of              developmental systems and the reaction of norms of genotypes to the             environments had been formulated during the first half of this                  century, only recently have they become a central focus of                      experimental and theoretical work.  The developmental aspect                    focuses on the concept of ontogenetic trajectories, which describes             the change in phenotype during growth.  The environmental                       variation, which elicits a genotype-specific response called                    phenotypic plasticity, is described by a function that relates                  environments and phenotypes through the genotype:  i.e., the                    reaction norm.  The aim of this proposal is to couple the                       developmental and environmental aspects in a study of genetic                   variability in two species, Lobelia cardinalis and Lobelia                      siphilitica (Lobeliaceae).  The research project is divided into                two distinct experiments:  (I) Experiment I is a description of the             plasticity for ontogenetic trajectories to different level of                   shading in the genotypes samples from two populations for each                  species.  The objective is to gain information about 1) genetic                 variation for reaction norms across development and 2) how                      environmental changes can modify the developmental trajectory.                  (II) Experiment II is an artificial selection experiment which -                based on the information obtained from Experiment I - will test the             ability of the genetic systems of Lobelia spp. to respond to                    selection on additive genetic variance of their reaction norms.  A              proximal objective of this type of research is to obtain reliable               models of phenotypic evolution, using some of the parameter values              from actual experiments.  Attempts in this sense have already been              published, but focused only on the ontogenetic component of                     variation.  A more comprehensive model is desirable, which includes             environmental variation and is consistent with our general                      understanding of biological complexity and with actual experimental             possibilities.  The ultimate goal is to gain a basic understanding              and a general phenomenological description of the ways in which                 phenotypic novelties can arise and eventually be fixed during                   macroevolution.  These notions, together with the parallel increase             in our knowledge of the physiological and molecular basis of such               phenomena, would eventually lead us to less vague statements about              how population biology and molecular genetics can be coupled for a              more complete understanding of evolutionary phenomena.",
