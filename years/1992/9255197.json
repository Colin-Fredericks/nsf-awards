Designed to enhance and strengthen the                                          chemistry program while facilitating the                                        recruitment and retention of students, the                                      proposed three-year program includes many                                       facets, the goal of which is to increase the                                    number of minority students who complete B. S.                                  degrees in chemistry and choose chemistry                                       careers.                                                                                                                                                        Program participants will represent various                                     sectors of the campus and community which play                                  major roles in the development of chemistry                                     careers.  All faculty members of the Chemistry                                  Department will be involved in the program.                                     Chemistry majors at the graduate and                                            undergraduate levels will participate as \"Big                                   Sisters and Big Brothers\" and as tutors for                                     students chose to be RCMS participants.                                         However, some tutors will be from other                                         scientific disciplines.  Faculty members in                                     the Counseling Program will provide counseling                                  services to the students.  Parents and                                          guardians will participate through their                                        involvement in selected workshops,                                              conferences, and interactions with students                                     and faculty members.  Chemistry Department                                      alumni will provide input through serving as                                    lecturers at selected seminars and as resource                                  persons.  High school personnel and persons                                     from other colleges and universities will                                       provide valuable information through their                                      recommendations and suggestions about                                           students.  Partners (e.g., national research                                    centers, private sector firms, universities)                                    will facilitate the completion of objectives                                    through their services as sites for research                                    experiences for students, sources of lecturers                                  and other experts who will provide needed                                       information, resources, and services in                                         enhancing and strengthening the chemistry                                       program.                                                                                                                                                        As a result of this program, a stronger                                         program of academic advising and support                                        services will be provided along with career                                     motivation and enrichment.  A more concerted                                    effort will be made to provide students with                                    the tools and encouragement needed to succeed                                   in chemistry careers.  Students will develop                                    their research skills through the faculty                                       mentoring relationship.  The results of their                                   work will be presented at national conferences                                  and published, when appropriate, in                                             scientific journals.  Junior and senior                                         students will be provided opportunities to                                      conduct research at non-campus research                                         centers.  Ultimately, the entire Chemistry                                      Department will be strengthened and                                             revitalized.  Tuskegee University's position                                    will be fortified in terms of recruiting and                                    retaining students in chemistry.  This                                          program, although small, will aid in the                                        provision of adequate numbers of well                                           qualified students to help offset the Nation's                                  shortage of scientists.",
