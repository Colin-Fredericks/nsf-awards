 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rathjen intends to work on the following four problems and                 related issues.  (1) Give an ordinal analysis of Pi-1-2                         comprehension.  (2) Develop strong ordinal representation systems               on the basis of recursively large ordinals in lieu of their large               cardinal analogues.  (3) Determine the proof-theoretic strength of              restricted foundations in weak set theories.  (4) Is Feferman's                 theory T-0 together with least fixed point axioms for monotone                  operators conservative over T-0 with respect to arithmetic                      sentences?                                                                           Proof theory concerns itself with axiomatic systems and                    methods of proof within them, particularly with the relative                    strength of different systems.  The system A is said to be properly             stronger than the system B if every proposition that has a proof in             B also has a proof in A but the converse is not so.  The                        investigator is pursuing a number of questions along these lines,               varying in technical difficulty and degree of interest to the                   experts, but none is really susceptible to a brief discussion in                laymen's terms.",
