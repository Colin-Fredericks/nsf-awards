 "awd_abstract_narration": "A codimension-one foliation F in a hyperbolic 3-manifold lifts             to a foliation F' in the universal cover, which is hyperbolic 3-                space.  The investigator will study the asymptotic behavior of                  leaves of F' and how fast they approach their limit sets.  He will              also analyze to what extent the topological structure of F                      determines the geometry of the manifold.  Finally, a non-singular               flow is Anosov if it induces hyperbolic behavior transversally to               the flow direction, so that in dimension 3 it determines two                    transverse codimension-one foliations.  The investigator plans to               examine the structure of the induced foliations in the universal                cover.  This is strongly related to homotopic properties of closed              orbits of the flow.  He also plans to study metric properties of                flow lines, for example, whether all flow lines can be                          quasigeodesic.                                                                       A foliation of a manifold is a way of filling the manifold                 with lower dimensional pieces.  In the case of a codimension-one                foliation, these pieces are of dimension one less than that of the              given manifold.  Think of an onion or an artichoke.  The topology               of a manifold is strongly related to the kind of foliation which it             will support, and in skillful hands this relation has been forged               into a powerful tool for investigating the topology of manifolds.               Foliations are also intimately related to the types of flows                    possible on a manifold.  Particularly in low dimensions, where the              standard algebraic techniques of topology work less well, using                 foliations to investigate manifolds and the possible flows on them              is a very welcome addition to the arsenal.",
