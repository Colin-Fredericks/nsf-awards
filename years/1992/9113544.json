 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of interfacial structure and                      dynamics.  During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant,               Professor Wirth and her students will investigate the dynamics and              orientational distributions of guest molecules interacting with                 covalently bonded, monolayer organic film hosts.  The specific                  theme of this work is the control of guest behavior through                     structural design of the host monolayer.  An understanding of                   guest-host monolayer interactions will facilitate the design of                 sensors for rapid and specific molecular recognition.  The                      particular aspects of host monolayer architecture being                         investigated in this project are the development of structurally                ordered monolayers, the control of defect shapes in dense                       monolayers, and the role of density in covalent, liquid crystal                 monolayers.  The guest properties of orientation and rotational                 diffusion dynamics in these host monolayers will be probed by                   picosecond fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence microscopy.                 Professor Wirth and her students will derive corroborative data                 from scanning tunneling microscopy and ellipsometric and contact                angle measurements.                                                             %%%                                                                             This research furthers the basic understanding of guest molecules               with covalently bound thin film hosts that is essential to the                  rational design of sensor devices which have a significant degree               of sensitivity and molecular selectivity.",
