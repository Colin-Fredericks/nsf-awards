 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although many people now agree with the premise that human activities        reduce the number of plant and animal species, few comprehensive                analyses have been undertaken to identify and analyze the human                 processes that alter biological diversity.  Among the human activities          that have had the most significant impacts on plants and animals is             agriculture.  This project will begin an analysis of the ways that basic        production of oilseeds and processing of those products encourages              expansion of biological diversity through development of new hybrids            while simultaneously altering the mix of vegetation within regions.  The        project will begin with a pilot study of canola (rapeseed) production in        western Canada.  Sources to be examined include histories of the                industry; scientific and technical journals; laws and administrative            rulings; standards published by seed companies, elevators, processors;          and data on production, exports, prices, and other variables.                   Information also will be gathered through interviews with farmers,              processors, and others engaged in canola production and hybrid                  development.  This information will be assessed in order to identify the        role of various human factors, including market forces, in activities           that alter biological diversity.                                                   This pilot project will provide valuable new insights about a dynamic        industry that exemplifies the ways that human activity can create and           alter biological diversity.  Of even greater future significance, it            will enable the investigators to develop a consistent methodological            approach for use in studying other oilseed industries in other settings,        and it will provide them with an opportunity to identify information            sources for other industries.  Through expansion of this line of                inquiry, comparisons will be drawn across a range of agricultural               activities, thereby providing an enhanced base from which to generalize         about the processes through which humans interact with the natural              environment.",
