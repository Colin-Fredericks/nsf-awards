 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards supports the research of Professor Y. Ye to work               in algebraic geometry.  He will work on the ample bundles on Fano               manifolds, extremal rays on projective manifolds, rationality of                a minimal degree curve and propagations of linear systems on                    curves on algebraic surfaces.                                                        The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                 the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                 to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems                that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures                  defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                       polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from                       algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it                 is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved                    itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical                      computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.",
