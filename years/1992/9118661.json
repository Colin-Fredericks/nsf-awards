 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objective of this laboratory is to elucidate the             molecular mechanisms and the functional components involved in the              regulation of plant gene expression in response to environmental                stimuli. Comprehension of these sensory and response pathways is                essential for understanding the dynamic nature of plant                         development. The expression levels of five genes, the TCH genes of              Arabidopsis, are rapidly and sharply increased in response to                   diverse stimuli, such as rain, wind, touch, heat shock and                      darkness. Three of the TCH genes encode calmodulin-related                      proteins, suggesting roles for calcium ion and calmodulin in the                signal transduction pathways.                                                                                                                                   The focus of this work is to characterize the regulation of the                 calmoduln-related TCH  genes in plants and cultured cells in                    response to diverse environmental stimuli. First, the transcription             initiation sites, intron/exon boundaries and polyadenylation sites              will be defined and the full-length cDNA sequences will be                      determined for the calmodulin-related TCH2 and 3 genes.                         Subsequently, the tissue- and developmental-specificity of TCH 2                and 3 mRNA accumulation in plants will be examined, with the                    emphasis on comparing the characteristics of the responses to                   different stimuli. The processes of habituation, desensitization                and recovery will be investigated using TCH mRNA accumulation as                an assay. Additionally, the regulation of TCH 2 and 3 gene                      expression by mechanical stress, heat shock and calcium ion will                be addressed using cultured root cells that are relatively                      homogeneous and easily manipulated. Because of the universal role               of calcium ion a second messenger in eukaryotic cells, elucidation              of the regulation of expression of genes that encode calcium ion                receptors will likely be relevant for the great variety of plant                and animal cells that transduce extracellular stimuli into calcium              signals.",
