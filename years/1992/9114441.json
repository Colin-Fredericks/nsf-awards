 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lindzen will continue his research on a broad set of problems              in dynamic meteorology which follow from studies conducted under                his previous grant.  Five specific topics for further research over             the next three years are planned:  (1) a special hydrodynamic                   mechanism that may allow energy extracted from a region of shear                flow to be transported away by waves,  (2) gravitational tides on               Jovian planets,  (3) a possible cause of the 100,000-year quasi-                periodicity of ice ages,  (4) a new procedure to produce initial                data for numerical weather forecasts, and  (5) the role of the                  water vapor budget of the upper troposphere in climate and climate              change.                                                                              His research on the first topic could uncover a process essen-             tial in shaping the atmospheric general circulation. The atmo-                  spheres of other planets, or the paleoclimatology of ours, are so               remote in space and time that these studies might appear, superfi-              cially, to be only of pedagogical and theoretical interest. They                will, however, add to our body of knowledge and understanding of                the behavior of planetary atmospheres. Lindzen is a member of the               National Academy of Sciences and, arguably, the leading present-day             dynamic meteorologist. His continued attention to refining the sys-             tem that produces our routine, daily computerized weather forecasts             serves as an example to the younger members of the research                     community in atmospheric sciences. He has also been an outspoken                public critic of the global warming numbers calculated by the                   present generation of climate models. He bases his skepticism on                their imprecise treatment of the feedbacks linking water vapor,                 cloud, and solar and terrestrial radiation. Improving this aspect               of the models is generally acknowledged to be one of most                       challenging problems in climate science, and has the highest                    research priority in science planning and policy. With his work on              the final topic he will contribute to intensified international                 efforts on the quantitative specification of these links.",
