 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will employ focal intracerebral                     microinfusions of drugs stereotaxically directed at specific                    regions of the medial temporal lobe:  perirhinal piriform                       cortex, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and                           amygdala.  These microinfusions will be administered to awake,                  behaving monkeys via chronically indwelling cappulas,                           immediately prior to evaluating performance on a visual                         recognition memory task.  The drugs to be used for the                          intracerebral infusions are selected for their effects on                       specific amino acid neurotransmitter receptors:  1) drugs                       which block excitatory transmission mediated via glutamate                      receptors (NMDA and non-NMDA subtypes) and 2) drugs which                       enhance inhibitory transmission mediated via GABAA receptors.                   The brain regions to be investigated have been selected on the                  basis of studies in the literature which have demonstrated                      significant deficits in visual recognition memory following                     individual or conjoint lesions of those regions.  In the                        experiments proposed, each subject will be repeatedly tested                    under drug and control conditions so that each subject serves                   as its own control and different drugs and infusions into                       various brain areas can be compared within the same subject.                    Once one or more brain areas (alone or in combination) have                     been identified in which the drug treatments impair                             performance on the recognition memory task, the anatomic                        site-specificity of the drug effect will be evaluated.  It is                   expected that blockade of excitatory transmission in                            perirhinal and entorhinal cortex, as accomplished by the focal                  application of glutamate antagonists in GABA agonists, will                     rapidly and reversibly impair performance on a visual                           recognition memory task.  Furthermore, it is expected that                      this acute impairment will require only unilateral drug                         application, in contrast to the bilateral damage required in                    chronic ablation studies.  It is hoped that the results of                      these studies will: (1) provide the basis for a more detailed                   investigation of the neurochemical and neuroanatomic                            substrates of memory functions subserved by neural networks in                  the limbic cortex; and (2) provoke additional studies in the                    nonhuman primate using focally applied chemical agents to                       probe brain regions crucial for cognitive function.                                   The use of reversibility-acting intracerebral focal drug                  infusions is expected to offer several advantages in studying                   the role of specific brain regions for memory functions in                      non-human primates.  In particular, a) the ability to use each                  subject as its own control reduces experimental variability                     and decreases the number of monkeys needed to generate                          interpretable data; b) the ability to test the same subject                     repeatedly using different drugs or different anatomical sites                  of infusion, maximizes the amount of experimental data that                     can be generated from a single monkey and increases the                         anatomical resolution that can be obtained; c) the ability to                   avoid damage to fibers of passage and problems with                             secondary degeneration which complicate the interpretation of                   lesion studies; and d) the ability to avoid permanent damage                    to the monkeys allows for non-terminal experiments in which                     the animals can be used subsequently for other studies.  These                  advantages could greatly enhance the feasibility and utility                    of pursuing this important field of research in monkeys.                              The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                    opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's                        enhanced visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The                    proposed activities which contribute to the second objective                    include:  training and mentoring graduate and undergraduate                     students by involving them in the experiments proposed;                         teaching a graduate elective course in Psychology (also open                    to undergraduates); leading a workshop for Women in Science                     through the Department of Women's Studies; presenting research                  accomplishments in lectures/colloquia sponsored by the                          Psychology Department and also in a forum sponsored by the                      Northwest Center for Research on Women; regularly attending                     student-faculty journal clubs in the Psychology Department, as                  well as weekly Student Research Seminars in physiological                       psychology.",
