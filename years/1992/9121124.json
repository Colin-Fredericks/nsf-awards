 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant from the Organic Dynamics Program will                        provide a portion of the expenses required for US scientists to                 attend the XIV IUPAC Symposium on Photochemistry at the                         University of Leuven in Belgium from July 19-25, 1992. The                      conference will focus on various aspects of both applied and                    basic photochemistry and photophysics. Issues involved in                       photobiology, photopolymers, small molecule photochemistry,                     interstellar photochemistry, and the environmental implications                 of photochemical events will be highlighted by presentations                    from a distinguished array of speakers from around the world.                   The challenge travel grants provided to US investigators will                   insure that there will be an adequate representation from the                   United States at this strategic scientific meeting in the field                 of photochemistry.                                                              %%%                                                                             Formal presentations at the meeting will range from discussions                 of the factors which govern the use of light to make and                        process silicon chips for electronics applications to                           the use of energy from pulsed lasers to probe the way in which                  many biological processes are stimulated by the absorption of                   light. The role of light in the oxidation of contaminants in                    water supplies, as well as the reactivity of chemical species                   in interstellar atmospheres, will also be discussed.",
