 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal continues a long term study of the structure and                  specificity of antibodies to a homopolymer of glucose alpha(1-6)                dextran and its oligosaccharides, and on blood group A, B and                   H substances.  It characterizes their primary and higher order                  structures by a variety of techniques.  The cavity-and groove-type              sites were defined, the former specific for terminal non-reducing               alpha(1-6) linked glucoses plus 3 or 4 additional residues, and the             latter reacting with internal chains of up to six or seven glucoses             not including the non-reducing end.  Anti-idiotypic sera and                    monoclonal antibodies recognizing either groove-or cavity-type                  sites have been obtained.  Model-building studies show that two                 cavity-type sites vary in size.  The hybridoma repertoire of                    anti-alpha(1-6) dextrans is being compared with E. coli expressed               Fab repertoire.  The role of Vl-CDR3 and J(kappa) on antigen                    binding, idiotype expression and combining sites structure of the               groove-type anti-alpha(1-6) dextrans with V(kappa)-Oxl light chain              is being studied by the generation of recombinant Fab and computer              modelling.                                                                      %%%                                                                             The research will concentrate on the following aspects of                       monoclonal antibodies to .(1-->6) dextrans: a) Mapping the                      structures of the combining sites by immunochemical methods and                 studies of anti-.(1-->6) dextrans with cavity and groove type                   antibody combining sites and their idiotypic specificities;  b)                 Providing quantities of the various characterized anti-.(1-->6)                 dextrans to various crystallographic laboratories for                           crystallization and high resolution x-ray diffraction studies.  c)              Continuation of replacement studies of a cloned antibody (amino                 acid residues 31 to 35) by glycines that have shown an                          extraordinary effect in greatly reducing anti .(1-->6) dextran                  reactivity and substantial restoration of 80% of the original anti              .(1-->6) dextran specificity by replacing glycine 32 and 33 by                  tyrosine and tryptophan. d) Studying the effects of similar                     substitutions in other interaction domains of the antibody.",
