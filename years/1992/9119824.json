 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, which is part of a joint package from Drs. Brunt,                 Michener, and Stafford, will support a symposium for the exchange               of information and technology among computer scientists, Geographic             Information system/Data Management specialists, and environmental               scientist (atmospheric, marine, and terrestrial) engaged in                     scientific database development, management of complex long-term                and broad area data sets, and addressing questions at ecosystem                 through biosphere scales.  The symposium will be organized along                four related themes:  (1)  ecosystem, regional and global scale                 environmental research; (2)  scientific databases for broad scale               research; (3) data/information management technical aspects; and                (4) management and analysis of broad scale spatial databases.  A                number to technical and scientific experts involved in each of the              four thematic areas have been contacted and tentatively agreed to               participate in the symposium and assist the symposium organizers                in identifying internationally recognized experts in the respective             fields.  The knowledge exchange and cross-fertilization of ideas                among scientists from a wide spectrum of disciplines fostered in                such a form, are essential for the development of the scientific                databases, data management, and analytical tools which will be                  necessary to address the problems facing environmental scientists               at a variety of scales.  A high quality volume of the proceedings               will be produced in a timely fashion and preliminary manuscripts                will be shared electronically.",
