 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Emeritus Foundation plans to network volunteer retired                      scientists, engineers, and mathematicians with approximately                    700 elementary school teachers in the Washington D.C. schools                   over a three year period.  Building on an existing program,                     the project will enable retired professionals to supplement                     science and mathematics offerings at the elementary level by                    working closely with teachers and students both in and out of                   the classroom. Activities include classroom hands-on                            demonstrations, field trips, mentoring, and workshops for both                  teachers and volunteers to maximize the effectiveness of the                    other activities and to design instructional activities and                     materials.  In addition, manuals will be created to assist                      with the training of new volunteers for the program.  The                       project is designed as a model which can be                                     replicated in other urban areas which have large populations                    of underrepresented students.",
