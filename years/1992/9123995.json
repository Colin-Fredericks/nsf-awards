 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maintaining genetic diversity within an endangered species                 is an important goal of conservation biology.  However, the                     threat of disease to endangered plants has been neglected in past                                                                                               studies.  Disease may cause plant numbers to decline and/or the                 disease may reduce the genetic diversity within a population.  An                                                                                               example is a white rust disease of the Menzies'wallflower,                      Erysimum menziesii, an endangered plant restricted to vanishing                 native dune communities along the northern California coast.                    Some populations of the plant suffer from the disease and,                      although the wallflower has been the object of extensive                        research, the destructive effect of the disease has not been                    investigated.  Both ecological and genetic studies are required.                                                                                                This research will closely examine the relationship between the                 wallflower and its disease to assess if disease has caused the                  plant to become endangered or is keeping the plant form                         recovering.  In addition, the genetic diversity within both the                 plant and pathogen populations will be measured for three years                 and this  will provide an indication if diversity is being                      maintained during conservation or if there is any change in the                 genetic structure.                                                              Many aspects of this research are unique.  It is a collaborative                                                                                                effort between The California Nature Conservancy, a conservation                                                                                                management organization, and Michigan State University, a                       traditional basic research institution.  This partnership will                  provide needed cooperative effort between basic science and                     applied conservation.  By combining genetic studies with                        population monitoring, management options specifically for                      Menzies' wallflower will be addressed.  In addition, this                       approach will introduce a generalized strategy to assess the                    impact of disease on other endangered plants.  The results will                 provide the basis for future predictive mathematical models which                                                                                               can be used to evaluate how specific conservation activities                    would affect recovery.  From this, conservationists will be able                                                                                                to choose between management options.  Included with these                      applied aspects is the basic study of plant disease in natural                  populations.  This project will expand the discipline by                        introducing a new type of model system, one with different                      attributes than those currently under study.",
