 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at Austin proposes to establish                         an Alliance for Minority Participation in Mathematics                           (AMPM) with the goal of eliminating the                                         underrepresentation of African Americans, Hispanics,                            and Native Americans in mathematics and related                                 disciplines.  As part of the Alliance, AMPM will                                establish (1) an alliance of twenty-five mathematics                            departments each working to achieve the above aim, (2)                          expand the capacity of fifty mathematics departments                            that already have Emerging Scholars Programs.  The                              Emerging Scholars programs are designed to help both                            freshmen excel mathematics and science.  These programs                         will serve at least 1,500 minority students during the                          course of the award.                                                            AMPM builds on more than ten years of work at Berkeley                          in creating programs that increase participation in                             mathematical and physical sciences.  These programs                             have been widely copied and now exist in various forms                          on more than 50 college and university campuses.  AMPM                          will work with the major professional organizations of                          mathematicians to make the operations of these and                              similar programs a legitimate and mainstream activity                           of mathematics departments.  It is the aim of this                              proposal to assure that the next generation of                                  mathematicians represents the full diversity of                                 American life.",
