 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program aims at studying the structure, function                  and organization of the Photosystem I reaction center complex in                cyanobacteria and green plants.  Our ability to resolve P700-                   FA/FB complex into the P700-FX core, the P700-A1 core, and P700-A0              core, and our ability to reconstitute each preparation with                     altered cofactors and genetically-modified polypeptides, has                    provided new research opportunities in Photosystem I.  The                      proposed program is based on the ability to resolve and                         reconstitute the Photosystem I reaction center in terms of                      polypeptides and cofactors, and has five major objectives:                      1)  To determine the involvement of FA and/or FB in the                             photoreduction of NADP+.                                                    2)  To confirm the ligands to the FX iron-sulfur cluster on PsaA                    and PsaB.                                                                   3)  To determine the roles of PsaD, PsaE and PsaF in Photosystem                    I function.                                                                 4)  To solve the 3-dimensional structure of the PsaC, PsaD and                      PsaE proteins.                                                              5)  To measure the spectroscopic properties of A1 with                              reconstituted quinones.                                                     %%%                                                                             Green plants are able to utilize sunlight as an energy source                   with the use of photosynthetic reaction centers to power the                    organism's growth, metabolism, and reproduction.  Two different                 kinds of reaction centers are located in the chloroplasts of                    green plants, and each contains chlorophyll, proteins, and metals               ions necessary for transforming solar energy into chemical                      energy.  In the last several years, we have learned how to remove               the proteins and metals from one of these reaction centers, and                 we have learned how to rebuild the reaction centers from the                    constituent parts.  In this proposal, we will rebuild the                       reaction centers using proteins that have been altered using                    techniques of modern genetic engineering.  We will obtain these                 proteins through a close collaboration with several molecular                   geneticists.  We will then use sophisticated measuring techniques               to determine the function of the individual proteins in the                     process of photochemical energy conversion.  By altering one                    protein while retaining the function of the others, we will be                  able to determine which protein provides a certain function in                  the process of the photosynthesis.  The proposal, therefore,                    relies on the marriage of two very powerful, but disparate                      techniques, genetics and biophysics, to solve the complicated                   problem of green plant photosynthesis.",
