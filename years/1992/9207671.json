 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will use comparative evidence from the               ontogeny of flowers to address phylogeny of legumes.  Polarization              methods will use outgroup comparison.  Preliminary trees based on               33 taxa representing major tribes of the three subfamilies of                   Leguminosae and 30 traditional characters from mature flower and                vegetative structure were developed for comparative purposes.  To               date, 17 qualitative ontogenetic characters with discrete character             states have been derived based on direct observation of floral                  ontogenies with SEM; most are heterochronic.  Preliminary results               show some unexpected relationships among tribes and subfamilies                 that need to be assessed in terms of characters used: i.e.,                     caesalpinioids Gleditsia and Ceratonia are a basal sister group to              the rest of the legumes; and Caesalpiniodeae appears non-                       monophyletic.  The research will also test the hypothesis that                  specialized character states are first expressed late in floral                 ontogeny, using species of Sophora, a papilionoid with diverse                  pollinators.  In addition, presumably different development                     pathways leading to convergent floral structure will be documented              in three caesalpinioid genera (Cassia s. str., Chamaecrista, Senna)             that are strikingly alike in specialized character states.",
