 "awd_abstract_narration": "Treeless parks dominated by sagebrush or grasses and herbs               are a conspicuous feature of the montane and subalpine vegetation               zones in the central Rocky Mountains.  Carbon-dated pollen                      records taken from cores of pond sediments can be used to                       reconstruct the vegetation history of a site or region.  The area               around Fish Creek Park in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming                   will be studied in this way to determine the pattern of spatial                 and temporal vegetation change.  An effort to reconstruct the                   vegetation history of the Taylor Park, Colorado area might also                 be warranted, depending upon preliminary findings.                                     Information about the age and spatial stability of the                   landscape will be used to test three hypotheses of park origin;                 these hypotheses (which involve persistence, remnants, and                      natural fire regimes) have been invoked to explain the existence                of parks, but have never been tested.  Further study of findings                might be extended to explain the origins of other parks in the                  region.  The timing and sequence of vegetation change that                      accompanies park formation will suggest new hypotheses related                  to specific mechanisms responsible for park establishment and                   maintenance.",
