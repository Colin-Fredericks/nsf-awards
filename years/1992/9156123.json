 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students in the freshman chemistry laboratory will be exposed                   to a variety of chemical principles in the context of                           environmental chemistry. The goals of the program are three: 1)                 to interest students in science early in their academic                         careers, particularly women and minority students; 2) to expose                 students to real-life issues that chemists face; and 3) to                      increase both the scientific literacy and the writing skills of                 all students who participate. The program is module-based,                      where each module focuses on a specific question that the                       students must answer about a site of environmental interest.                    The questions are related to the analysis of drinking water                     quality, lead deposition near freeways, and toxic waste sites.                  A \"discovery\" method of teaching the course will be employed,                   in which the students will be presented with a question and                     then must propose answers themselves instead of being presented                 with a solution. Teamwork and discussion in the area of                         decisionmaking will also be emphasized. After deciding how they                 will answer the central question, the students will visit the                   sites, take samples, and bring them back to the laboratory for                  testing. A variety of sophisticated techniques will be                          utilized, including ion chromatography, atomic absorption                       spectrometry, and gas chromatography. The students will hand in                 written reports on their work instead of the usual \"fill-in-                    the-blanks\" type of form used in many freshman chemistry labs.                  The final module will consist of independent projects, with the                 topic chosen by the student. The projects will require the                      student to use his or her knowledge of sampling, site                           assessment, laboratory techniques, and writing skills to study                  an environmental problem and present the results of that study                  to the rest of the class in a poster session during the final                   laboratory period.  An Advisory Committee and symposium on its                  findings and products will accompany the project.",
