 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compile-time analysis techniques to aid the development of software             in sequential and parallel programming environments will be the focus           of this research.  There are two trusts:  (i) the maturation of work            in designing incremental data flow algorithms for semantic impact               analysis of source code changes in software systems, and (ii) the               investigation of how compile-time analysis can aid the compilation and          debugging of programs that have implicit and/or explicit parallelism.                                                                                           In debugging of concurrent systems, compile-time analysis is used to            help programmers debug software written with explicit parallelism.              Typical problems include races in shared memory machines,                       indeterminately ordered accesses to the same memory location where at           least one access is a write, and deadlocks, non-terminating                     computations which cannot continue because of improper                          synchronizations.  For detection on shared memory machines, use of              interprocedural data flow information and good internal                         representations of parallel primitives are being explored, as well as           a case study analyzing Ada rendezvous mechanisms.  It is intended to            combine compile-time analysis with run-time testing for these                   problems, using the former to guide the latter.  This work will                 culminate in development of prototype software tools demonstrating the          techniques on actual Ada and Fortran programs.  Desired extensions              include studying the applicability to a broad range of synchronization          primitives and classifying their properties with respect to these               problems.",
