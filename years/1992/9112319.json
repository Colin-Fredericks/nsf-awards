 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of how spatial and temporal environmental                      variation affects an ecological mutualism could reveal clues                    about mechanisms for the persistence and evolutionary origins of                the mutualism.  This study will focus on seasonal, site, and                    gender variation in the phenology of two dioecious fig species                  (Ficus, of which there are more than 500 altogether) and their                  pollinator wasps (including Ceratosolen marchali and Kradibia                   gestroi).  The dioecious fig - fig wasp mutualism is of special                 interest because: 1) its persistence requires that wasps                        regularly enter and pollinate female fig flowers in which the                   wasps die, leaving no offspring, and 2) according to ideas                      relating seasonality to the evolution of dioecy, maintenance of                 the obligate pollinators requires that male trees flower at times               when their success as pollen donors to female trees is small.                   How this mutualism persists seems therefore rather problematical.               This study will investigate predictions formulated from studies                 of monoecious figs and a dioecious fig (Ficus carica), an                       ecological outlier exhibiting unusual phenology.  Detailed                      observations of known (mapped) individual branches, together with               hand pollinations, self-pollination, and choice experiments will                facilitate tests of hypotheses regarding the persistence of this                mutualism and various possible outcomes for each of the                         participating components.                                                             Studies will be conducted in protected deciduous and                      evergreen forests of Karnataka State, India. It may be that these               figs, like many others, reign as keystone species in the forests                in which they occur, heavily influencing the occurrence/absence                 of other particular plant or animal species within the same                     habitats.",
