 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will test the working hypothesis that \"the                         distributions of the respective chemical species follow a                       predictable annual pattern, with interannual variability falling                within a characteristic 'envelope' driven by  discharge effects                 on the sequences of (a) tributary inputs, which can be described                by a regional chromatography model (b) in situ carbon oxidation,                which is maintained through a dynamic equilibrium, and (c)                      mainstemvarzea linkages, which are a function of basin structural               features.   Specific research objectives include:                                                                                                               Objective 1. The Regional Chromatograph: (1) Developing a                       regional-scale research paradigm (2) Examining the chemical basis               for a regional chromatographic model.  (3) Developing the                       capability to model water, chemical, and sediment routing at                    subbasin scales, and (4) Developing a sampling network for                      tributary basin and upriver sampling.                                                                                                                           Objective 2: Mainstem Dynamics: (1) Determining interannual                     variability by continuing the Marchantaria monthly time series                  for routine parameters and augmenting these with more detailed                  chemical characterizations and maintaining data input from the                  DNAEE hydrologic data base.  (2) Examining the \"dynamic                         equibrium\" concept through analyses of the patterns of biogenic                 gases, bacterial carbon dynamics, temporal variability inorganic                composition, and selected N and P forms.  (3) Modeling mainstem                 routing and mainstem-floodplain exchange through the extension of               a 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model, incorporating remote sensing                data on water and sediment exchange.                                                                                                                            The research is pertinent to resolution of major ecological                     questions at the continental scale within the preview of global                 change.  Past work has been productive, and collaborative                       arrangements with Brazilian scientists are excellent.",
