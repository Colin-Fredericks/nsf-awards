 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Anjan Bose and a                                  graduate student of Arizona State University to                                 collaborate in electrical engineering research                                  with Professor Edmund Handschin and his research                                team at the University of Dortmund, Germany.                                    The subject of their collaboration is the                                       dynamic security analysis of electric power                                     systems.  Both groups are actively involved in                                  research in this important new area of electric                                 power engineering, but they bring different                                     strengths and different research approaches to                                  the problem.  For example, in the area of                                       parallel processing, the Arizona group is                                       concentrating on finding parallel algorithms                                    that will operate on available multiprocessors,                                 while the German group is seeking the best                                      parallel architecture to solve the dynamic                                      equations.  Both are involved in the development                                of worst case contingency screening tools for                                   power system control centers.  In this area, the                                Arizona group has concentrated on faster, though                                less accurate, analytical methods while the                                     German group is developing expert systems that                                  are more accurate than analytical methods but                                   more limited in other ways.  A major objective                                  of the collaboration is to find a balance                                       between these approaches that will optimize                                     dynamic analysis.                                                                                                                                               The continual on-line assessment of security of                                 the large interconnected power transmission and                                 generation grid is a complex problem of great                                   importance to North America and Western Europe,                                 both of which have suffered regional blackouts                                  that have had serious economic consequences.                                    The security of the electric power network lies                                 in its ability to withstand unexpected                                          disturbances or contingencies.  Yet current                                     state of the art assumes stable operation of the                                system during any disturbance, because                                          calculations required for realistic modeling of                                 a dynamic, fluctuating operation cannot be done                                 fast enough for on-line operation.  The ongoing                                 U.S.-German research assisted by this award                                     focuses on solving this dynamic security                                        analysis problem.",
