 "awd_abstract_narration": "The instrumentation requested will strengthen experimental                      approaches to environmental biology.  The automated toxicity                    bioassay using bioluminescent bacteria and the computer                         controlled respirometer requested will bring recent advances in                 environmental research capability into the undergraduate                        laboratory. Introductory biology students will operate in small                 research groups and play an active role designing the                           experimental approach used to answer meaningful scientific                      questions and thus gain a larger sense of what it means to do                   modern science.  Once introduced to advanced instruments as                     freshman, students can employ them with increasing                              sophistication in intermediate and advanced courses.  Toxicity                  tests on heavy metals provide the context for examination of                    general dose response curves and synergistic effects of other                   environmental variables on toxicity.  Respiration measurements                  will allow freshmen to explore the effects of temperature on                    metabolism.  Advanced students will conduct an intensive                        investigation into physiological responses of estuarine animals                 to hypoxia and anoxia, simulating low oxygen levels typically                   found in the Chesapeake Bay.",
