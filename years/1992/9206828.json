 "awd_abstract_narration": "A joint analytical and experimental investigation is to be                      conducted of the viscous decay, evolution and interaction of                    vortex couples at large Reynolds number.  Analytically,                         boundary layer ideas are used to derive their behavior from                     known inviscid solutions.  The interaction of vortex couples                    with weak background vorticity or shear is studied using                        singular perturbation theory.  By studying mixing in the large                  Peclet number limit, estimates on the efficiency of vortex                      couples in transport are derived.  The experiments employ a                     novel use of stratification to create two-dimensional flows.                    Mixing is studied quantitatively by the optical tracking of                     tracer particles and dye.  Data processing determines the                       velocity and vorticity fields as they evolve.                                                                                                                   Vortex couples, localised dipolar regions of vorticity,                         possess nearly closed streamlines, are self-propagating, and                    persist for long times.  Consequently, they efficiently                         transport vorticity, momentum, heat and contaminants.  Vortex                   couples arise in the shear layers and plumes observed in                        atmospheric chemistry, ocean mixing, convective cooling, and                    turbulent transport and mixing.",
