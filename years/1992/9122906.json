 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study proposes to examine the placement of the order                  Carnivora as well as several other groups, among the eighteen                   extant orders of eutherian mammals.  DNA sequence data will be                  gathered from four different loci: Cytochrome B, Ubiquitin,                     Histone H3, and the oncogene K-ras.  The use of nucleotide                      sequence data from several different loci, rather than all the                  sequence of one large gene, yields comparisons of codon bias,                   rate of evolution, and retention of phylogenetic signal between                 genes as well as avoiding the evolutionary, peculiarities of any                one locus.  Each order will be represented by at least two taxa,                which will be chosen to be as diverse as possible based on prior                systematic analyses.  A parsimony approach combined with down-                  weighting of saturated sites will be used to analyze the data.                  Additionally, molecular information will be combined with the                   pertinent morphological data in a separate analysis.  This                      combination of phylogenetic sampling, use of multiple loci, and                 total information analysis makes it likely that the so far                      equivocal information on relationships of many of the mammalian                 orders will be better understood and that current theories of                   mammalian molecular evolution will be better tested and expanded.",
