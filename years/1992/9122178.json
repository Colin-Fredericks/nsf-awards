 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to understand the cognitive models, assumptions,              and inference methods the comprise the layperson's system of                    \"intuitive toxicology\" and to compare this system with the                      cognitive models, assumptions, and inference methods of                         toxicologists and risk assessors.  Such comparisons would expose                the similarities and differences within the expert and lay                      communities as well as the differences between lay perceptions and              expert views.  Several empirical studies will be designed,                      conducted, and reported during the course of this project.  These               studies should produce clearer, better articulated representation               of the conceptual frameworks that exist for experts and laypeople               with regard to chemical hazards and the scientific methods used to              assess chemical risks.  Such representations are crucial for                    improved methods of risk assessment and for the development of a                risk-management process that replaces polarized social conflict                 with effective multi-way communication about chemical risks and                 benefits.",
