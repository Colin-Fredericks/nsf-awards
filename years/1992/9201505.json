 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide supplementary support                                   to enable Dr. Dorothy Rountree of Duke                                          University to conduct collaborative research                                    with Dr. Sho Sakurai for 12 months at Kanazawa                                  University in Japan.  Rountree and Sakurai will                                 utilize Rountree's expertise in molecular                                       endocrinology to investigate ketoreductase and                                  its role in regulating insect physiology and                                    development.                                                                                                                                                    Insects are encased by a chitinous exoskeleton                                  which is shed or molted when the insects grow.                                  This molting process is controlled by a family                                  of steroid hormones known as ecdysteroids.                                      Synthesis of these ecdysteroids in the insect's                                 prothoracic glands is triggered by the release                                  of a prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH),                                         ecdysone, from the insect's brain.  Recently                                    another ecdysteroid, 3-dehydro-ecdysone, was                                    discovered to be the PTTH secreted by some                                      insects.  This PTTH is reduced to ecdysone by                                   an enzyme, ketoreductase.  Dr. Sakurai is                                       currently the world's premier investigator of                                   ketoreductase and Dr. Rountree's experience                                     with molecular and endocrine techniques will                                    facilitate the study of ketoreductase at the                                    molecular and genetic level, providing                                          information on the enzyme's vital regulatory                                    role in insect development.",
