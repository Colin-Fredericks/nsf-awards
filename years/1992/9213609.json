 "awd_abstract_narration": "CEDAR is a 3-phased aeronomy initiative that is recognized                 within both national and international communities.  Since the                  fundamental concept of the program involves collaborative and                   community-wide use of resources as well as multi-institution                    campaigns and science analysis activities, there is a clear need                for coordination.  The basic role of the CEDAR Science Steering                 Committee (CEDAR-SSC) is to provide for coordination and                        information transfer throughout the U.S. aeronomy community as well             as in the international realm.  CEDAR is currently in Phase II of               the program, durieng which time there will be extensive funded                  science campaign activities as well as activities involving                     instrument and facility development and upgrades.  Members of the               steering committee are selected by the NSF Program Directors for                the Aeronomy and Upper Atmospheric Facilities sections of the                   Atmospheric Sciences Directorate in consultation with the current               SSC members.                                                                                                                                                         During the next two years, the committee will meet regularly               to discuss the various issues involving campaign organization,                  instrument operation, the program for the annual CEDAR summer                   workshop, promotion of CEDAR in the national and international                  sphere, facility operation, and science symposia planning.",
