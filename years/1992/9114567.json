Mason of Oregon State University to the University of Queens-                land, Australia, to work with Dr. Joan Margaret Whittier on                     reproduction in the tropical colubrid brown tree snake, Boiga                   irregularis, which is native to Australia, New Guinea, and the                  Solomon Islands.  During World War II, the snake was introduced                 onto Guam, where it clearly established itself as a serious threat              to native fauna and to humans.  This snake is responsible for the               extinction of three species of native birds on Guam, and the                    serious declination in the populations of most, if not all,                     remaining small vertebrates on the island.  B. irregularis is a                 prolific colonizer and it has now been found on several additional              islands, including Hawaii.  Little is known of the biology in                   general of these snakes.  Of particular importance in terms of                  managing this emerging threat to Pacific island fauna is the                    investigation of the reproductive potential of female brown tree                snakes in their natural range in Australia.  Specifically, the                  investigators will (1) characterize histologically the cycle of egg             and sperm production, and sperm storage; (2) determine by                       radioimmunoassay sex steroid hormone secretion in both sexes; and               (3) investigate the chemical ecology of these animals by isolating              and chemically characterizing potential sex attractant pheromones               produced by females.",
