 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two parts.  The first deals with innovation, the               second with human capital accumulation of a conventional sort.                                                                                                  Growth in the most advanced economies is fueled by the development              of new products and processes, and growth in the developing world               by successful adoption of existing technologies.  The first part                of the research is a more systematic examination of the factors                 that determine the aggregate level of innovative activity in each               setting.  Chief among these are the degree of substitutability                  among products and the nature of competition in the product market.             A key question is under what circumstances a less developed economy             will tend to catch up to a more advanced one.                                                                                                                   During the 1980's real wages in the U.S. rose for professional                  workers and stagnated or fell for other groups.  The second part                of the research is directed toward explaining the dynamics of the               relative wages of skilled and unskilled labor as an economy                     develops.  Trade between economies with different mixes of skilled              and unskilled labor, and the incentives for skilled and unskilled               labor to migrate from less to more developed economies will also                be examined.",
