 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study the role of somatic mutation of                    immunoglobulin variable (V) genes in development of antibody                    diversity. A fusion protein containing a rearranged V gene with a               stop codon 5' to the lacZ gene will be constructed. The lacZ gene               can be easily detected by fluoresence or histochemistry. The fusion             protein will be used to make transgenic mice and in cell lines. The             stop codon prevents translation of the lacZ \"exon\" unless a somatic             mutation occurs, causing reversion of the stop codon and expression             of lacZ. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) will be used to             isolate cells expressing lacZ; and putative mutations will be                   confirmed by sequencing after PCR. The expression and location of               somatic mutation during ontogeny will be determined by                          histochemistry and FACS analysis of isolated cells. This should                 help determine the mechanism of somatic mutation.                               %%%                                                                             Antibodies are proteins which react with millions of different                  kinds of compounds, and among other things are a major source of                defense from disease-causing organisms.  Antibodies to each                     compound are not identical to those against other compounds. The                mechanism by which this specificity is obtained is still not                    completely understood. A method to study the role of somatic                    mutation in producing antibody diversity involves making a fusion               construct which contains a piece of rearranged V gene and the gene              for a reporter protein called lacZ. The rearranged V gene contains              a \"stop\" signal which will prevent synthesis of the lacZ protein.               The product of the lacZ gene can be easily detected. Only if a                  mutation occurs in the \"stop\" signal can this product form. Mice                containing the fusion construct will be used for several studies,               to see where and when the lacZ can be detected. This may help                   increase our understanding of antibody diversity.",
