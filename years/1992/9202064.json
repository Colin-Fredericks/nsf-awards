 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solitary internal waves are common features in the ocean,                  due to existing temperature and salinity variations, and play an                important part  in the transport of energy and momentum.  Our                   current theoretical  understanding of internal solitary-wave                    dynamics is based, to a large  extent, on weakly nonlinear long-                wave theories which are derived on the  assumption that only long               waves are present.  On the other hand, there  is evidence from                  laboratory and field observations that, in general,  large-                     amplitude solitary internal waves do not remain locally confined                as suggested by these approximate theories, but, rather, they                   develop  short-wavelength oscillatory tails that cause radiation                damping.  This  radiation, in turn, provides a nonlinear                        mechanism for coupling  large-amplitude solitary-wave                           disturbances with short-scale oscillatory  waves of different                   modes.  For example, it is possible for solitary  internal waves                to transfer energy to short-scale surface waves that  remain                    phase-locked with the internal waves P a situation reminiscent of               the surface rips that often accompany internal waves in the                     field, and  are visible in radar images of the sea surface.                          In order to fill the gap currently existing in our                         theoretical  understanding, this research program investigates                  the generation of  oscillatory tails and the related radiation-                 dampling mechanism of  solitary internal waves, using singular-                 perturbation and numerical  methods.  Particular emphasis is                    placed on calculating the amplitude of  short-wave tails under                  realistic conditions, including the possibility  of deep fluids                 and the presence of a free surface.  For this purpose, a                        nonlinear WKB technique will be developed for weakly nonlinear                  disturbances, and fully numerical computations will be carried                  out for large-amplitude solitary waves.  In addition, the                       transfer of energy  from solitary waves to small-scale                          disturbances of different modes  (short-scale surface or lower-                 mode internal waves) will be examined in  comparison with other                 physical processes, like viscous dissipation, that  occur in                    practice.",
