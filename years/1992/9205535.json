 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators continue research on homoclinic and                      heteroclinic bifurcation and on several important applied                       problems in which homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcation theory                are crucial.  They continue work begun by Lin on spatially                      patterned solutions of reaction-diffusion wquations near                        spatially homogeneous solutions, represented by homoclinic orbits               on heteroclinic cycles of the reaction equation.  They                          investigate a new approach, based on earlier work, to the                       stability of stationary solutions of reaction-diffusion equations               with small diffusion that consist of regular and transition                     layers, in which the stability would be checked layer by layer.                 They continue work begun by Schecter using heteroclinic                         bifurcation theory to study the solutions of systems of                         conservation laws.  They also continue work on the stability and                convergence of numerical methods for finding homoclinic and                     heteroclinic orbits to nonhyperbolic equilibria.                                     It can happen that if one starts a dynamic process near one                of its steady states, the resulting orbit of the process goes far               from that state, then returns to the same or a different steady                 state.  Such an orbit is called homoclinic or heteroclinic                      respectively.  These orbits turn out to be key to understanding                 numerous phenomena in the sciences.  The investigators continue                 their studies of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, and of                     mathematical aspects of them that are important in applications.                One subject they investigate is how two interacting dispersed                   populations can spontaneously become organized into spatial                     patterns of varying population densities that fluctuate over                    time, because of homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits in the                       underlying dynamics.  The second subject is an idea of Lin for                  understanding the stability of propagating fronts, in chemical                  reactions, for example, by viewing the fronts as heteroclinic                   orbits.  The third subject is complicated waves that arise in                   solutions of equations such as those that model the recovery of                 oil from an underground reservoir when water is pumped in to                    force it out.  These waves can be viewed as heteroclinic orbits.                The fourth subject is the robustness and accuracy of numerical                  methods used to compute homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits.",
