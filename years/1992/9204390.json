 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important issue in the design of host-network interfaces is             how much protocol processing should be done in hardware (i.e. on                the network device) and how much should be done in software (i.e.,              on the host).  THis issue is becoming increasingly important as                 improving network performance puts more and more stress on the end              host.  Recent work in this area has focused on moving one or more               high-level protocols from the host to the network device.  In                   contrast, the principal investigators propose to investigate                    another point on the design spectrum. --a chip that implements a                collection of protocol-independent functions.  The PIs have                     identified key functions that span multiple  protocols, and plan to             provide these functions in hardware.                                                 The chip, called the x-chip is an outgrowth of the PIs' work               on the x-Kernel--software architecture that supports protocol                   implementations.  One of the design philosophies of the x-Kernel                has been to identify tasks that are common to all protocols, and to             provide general software tools that support these tasks.  The                   x-chip takes this philosophy one step further by moving certain                 aspects of the support tools into hardware.  The ultimate goal is               to integrate the network device and the network software                        infrastructure vertically.",
