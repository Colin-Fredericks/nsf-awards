 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sustainable agriculture and environmental preservation are                 important topics in research on development in Third World                      settings at present.  It is important that this research be                     informed by longitudinal studies of agroclimatological change                   which document change, explain the processes and events leading                 to change, and consider the consequences of change in the lives                 of people living in developing societies.  Longitudinal studies                 of change in agricultural regions of developing countries are                   uncommon.  This project offers a unique opportunity to revisit a                region in East Africa that was studied twenty years ago.  The                   Tanga Region of Tanzania lies along a climatic transect where                   rainfall distribution changes from two seasons in the northeast                 to one season in the southwest.  This situation presents                        interesting and potentially significant questions of agricultural               potential and management.  The research will analyze                            climatological data, crop productivity, and agricultural risk in                this area of great climatic variability and uncertainty.  A                     random sample of farmers will be interviewed about their                        agricultural practices, management decisions, and social                        behavior, and these data will be compared to those collected in                 the same region two decades earlier.  These data will be used to                assess changes in the effects of rainfall variation, moisture                   stress in crops, crop yields, and management interventions on                   agricultural practices.  The objective will be to enhance the                   ability to predict which practices will produce different crop                  yields under conditions of environmental uncertainty.                                This research should provide basic knowledge about whether                 and how agricultural practices have changed over the twenty year                interval since the original survey.  It will also improve our                   understanding of the relationship between climate variation over                space and time and its effect on agricultural management                        practices.  These insights will be helpful in formulating                       agricultural policy which attempts to foster sustainable                        development practices in sensitive agricultural areas of                        developing nations.",
