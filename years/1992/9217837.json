 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a decapeptide that was                 isolated from brain in 1971.  With the development of sophisticated             antibody technology, the GnRH neuronal network was demonstrated to              be a complex, heterogenous system, comprising three or more                     discrete neuronal groups and spanning vastly different regions of               the brain, including the ganglion of the terminal nerve within the              olfactory bulb and nerve, the basal forebrain including the                     preoptic area, and the caudal diencephalon or midbrain region.                  Moreover, GnRH neurons project to targets within and outside the                brain and serves as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter.  It is               implicated in controlling the expression and maintenance of                     neuroendocrinological traits underlying behavioral reproductive                 mechanisms.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research award to Dr.             Bass will facilitate the development of sensitive and specific                  molecular tools which will be instrumental in providing new                     insights into the cellular and molecular bases for hormonal control             of sexual differentiation of brain and behavior.  He will complete              the sequence analysis and sequence comparisons of cDNAs for GnRH                in a specific species that serves as a model to examine intrasexual             dimorphisms in brain and behavior.  Dr. Bass will use the antisense             ribonucleic acid transcripts generated from the cloned cDNAs and                in situ hybridization histochemistry to identify the expression                 patterns and quantitate levels of novel GnRH transcripts in the                 brain of juvenile and adult animals with distinct reproductive                  phenotypes.  The development of these new sensitive molecular tools             will open up new avenues into this emerging research area.  The                 research will lead to a better understanding of the role that GnRH              plays in basic mechanisms underlying reproducive maturation,                    physiology and species-typical behaviors.",
