The objective of                                     this proposal is to generate intense terahertz                                  bandwidth microwave radiation pulses form                                       semiconductor photovoltaic devices, and apply                                   it to the study of transient electric and                                       optoelectronic properties of dielectric materials                               under an extremely high field with a                                            contactless approach.  The technique consists                                   of using a picosecond laser beam to illuminate                                  semiconductor solar cells, and generates                                        electron magnetic radiation produced by rapid                                   current transients due to optical injection of                                  free carriers into the static electric field.  The                              radiation is directional and diffraction-limited.                               Since the microwave energy comes mainly                                         from the static energy stored in the                                            semiconductor devices rather than from the                                      incident laser energy, with the proper design                                   of device structure and high external bias, the                                 total power of the radiation can well exceed                                    the incident power of the laser beam.  A                                        study of the power scaling properties suggests                                  that the scaling up to GigaWatt peak powers                                     is feasible in semiconductor photovoltaic                                       structure sizes up to 100 cm2.  It is possible                                  to study transient electric and optoelectric                                    properties of dielectric materials under an                                     extremely high field with a contactless                                         approach, and to pursue a new subject:                                          nonlinear microwave measurement of dielectric                                   materials.",
