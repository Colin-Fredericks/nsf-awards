 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concentrates on several theoretical                         investigations and applications of Bayesian methods to small area               estimation,  as well as the study of Bayesian robustness in finite              population sampling ,  and Bayesian information.                                                                                                                      Recently the use of small area estimation has been increasing             in survey sampling.  Agencies of the Federal Government have been               involved in obtaining estimates of unemployment rates,  per capita              income,  crop yields,  and so forth,  for state and local                       government areas.  In typical instances,  only a few samples are                available from an individual area,  and an estimate of a certain                area mean,  or simultaneous estimates of several area means,  can               be improved by incorporating information from similar neighboring               areas.                                                                                                                                                                Empirical and hierarchical Bayes methods are  particularly                well-suited to meet this need of \"borrowing strength\"  from related             small areas.  The principal investigator,  over the years,   has                developed general univariate Bayesian methods with applications to              small area estimation.  The present research is concerned with the              extension of such methods to multivariate small area estimation                 problems and with the analysis of repeated survey data,  which                  amounts to time series analysis.  Specific applications will be                 made to the study of undercount adjustment in the 1990 census,                  estimation of median incomes of three-, four-, and five-person                  families as needed by the Department of Health and Human Services,              and the estimation of all employee totals in non-agricultural                   industrial establishments as needed by the Bureau of Labor                      Statistics.                                                                                                                                                           The principal theoretical investigation will consist of the               robustness study of Bayesian procedures,  that is,  how robust a                Bayesian procedure is against departures from the assumed prior.                Specific applications of these robustness ideas will be made in                 the context of finite population sampling.  The final theoretical               investigation will consist of an analytical study of the                        information content in different priors through a pure posterior                analysis.                                                                                                                                                             Profession Ghosh is well equipped to perform the proposed                 research.  His past work in this area has had substantial impacts               and the present quartet of projects should yield  both important                methodological and applied results.",
