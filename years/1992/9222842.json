 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major unresolved problem in fisheries oceanography is the                mechanism by which water column density stratification affects                  growth and survival of larval fish populations.  These initial US               GLOBEC field and modeling studies will evaluate the potential                   effects of climate change of larval survival due to changes in the              stratification process on Georges Bank.  Water column density                   stratification has been shown to have a significant influence on                the feeding and survival of larval cod and haddock on George Bank               by providing a concentrating mechanism for their prey organisms.                Changes in wind, precipitation and temperature suggested by climate             change models could significantly alter the stratification process              on Georges Bank and affect the feeding and survival of larval fish.                  This project will involve scientists from NOAA/NMFS, Woods                 Hole Oceanographic Institution, Bigelow Labs, and the USGS.                     Cooperative funding is provided by NOAA, NSF and USGS; the NSF                  contribution in FY1992 via this award.",
