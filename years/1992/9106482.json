 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Richard J. Lagow of the Chemistry Department at the                         University of Texas at Austin is supported by the Inorganic,                    Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program for continued research                 on the synthesis, structure, and bonding of polylithium organic                 compounds.  In these species, two or more lithium atoms are                     attached to the same, adjacent, or nearly adjacent carbon                       atoms.  Two of the novel compounds that will be attempted to be                 prepared are tetralithioethylene and perlithioadamantane.                       Thermal rearrangement synthesis will continue to be used for                    substituted dilithiomethanes and lithium-halogen exchange                       techniques will also be explored.  Formation of silicon,                        germanium, and oxygen compunds containing lithium as a                          substituent will be attempted.  Four-center, two-electron                       bonding has been proposed to rationalize the structures thus                    far observed so attempts will be made to apply that model in                    new compounds.  Noble gas matrix isolation, mass spectrometry,                  and crystallographic techniques will be used to characterize                    the products.                                                                   %%%                                                                             The polylithium compounds proposed for synthesis and                            characterization are unusual and highly reactive molecules.                     They may find utility as new materials or in new types of solid                 or liquid batteries, but their immediate usefulness will likely                 be in expanding methods available for synthesis of other                        organic and organometallic compounds.",
