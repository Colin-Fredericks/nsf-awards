 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is estimated that the steel industry generates 5 percent of                  all greenhouse gases produced by human activity.  This is a                     consequence of the intensive use of carbon as a reductant to                    extract metallic iron from its ore.  The purpose of the                         proposed work is to examine the feasibility of electrolytic                     steelmaking, a process of direct electrolysis of molten iron                    oxide to produce pure liquid iron and oxygen gas.  While                        electrochemical processing in molten oxides has enormous                        potential for the carbon-free extraction and refining of                        metals, to date there has been no sustained effort to develop                   a commercial process based on this technique, in part due to                    the inadequacy of the database.  The question under study in                    the proposed investigation is the following:  is it possible                    to conceive of a chemistry to support the direct electrolysis                   process described? To answer this question the high-                            temperature physical chemistry of molten oxide solution will                    be studied.  Their electrical properties will be investigated                   by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).  A new cell                    for electrical conductivity measurements of highly reactive                     oxide melts has been designed for this purpose and is being                     certified in tests with aqueous KC1 solutions and melts of                      NaC1 and KC1.  The thermodynamics of molten oxide solutions                     will be investigated by emf measurements.  Reference                            electrodes have been designed for this purpose and will be                      examined during the course of investigation.  Finally,                          electrolysis trails will be conduced in laboratory-scale cells                  designed to operate in the parameter ranges indicated by the                    data taken earlier.  On an empirical basis, such tests have                     been conducted with feed consisting of oxide mixtures                           containing iron oxide and chromium oxide and oxygen evolution                   has been observed on an inert anode made of platinum.  This                     confirms that faradaic processes can be made to operate in                      these melts.  With a deeper understanding of the fundamentals                   it will be possible to optimize the system.                                                                                                                     Successful completion of the work will enable the development                   of a new carbon-free steelmaking process which in principle                     has the capability to be modified in accordance with different                  feedstock chemistries.  For example, one could make                             ferroalloys such as ferrochromium (as a precursor for                           stainless steel) by electrolysis of the mixed oxides of iron                    and chromium.  Similarly, one could produce ferromanganese by                   electrolysis of iron oxide-manganese oxide.  Thus, metal                        production by direct electrolysis in molten oxides would not                    only solve a wide array of environmental problems facing the                    steel industry but also would serve as the basis for leapfrog                   technology to strengthen the U.S. industry's international                      competitive position.",
