Rackham School of Graduate Studies, the College of                 Engineering, and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts               at the University of Michigan hereby apply for $1,149,642 under the             Research Careers for Minority Scholars Program.  These funds will               be used to conduct the University of michigan Research Careers for              Minority Scholars (UM-RCMS) Programs, a program of undergraduate                research, faculty mentoring, and related support activities to                  identify highly talented students who are from minority groups                  underrepresented in science, engineering, and mathematics and                   encourage them to pursue doctoral study in these fields.                                                                                                        The UM-RCMS program will annually appoint twenty students as UM-                RCMS Scholars.  Ten of these students will be from the Ann Arbor                Campus undergraduate program; the others will be visitors invited               from Historically Black, Hispanic-serving, or Native American-                  serving Universities, or from colleges and universities serving                 large proportions of students from these underrepresented                       populations.                                                                                                                                                    A unique aspect of the proposed UM-RCMS program is the Scientific               Executive Committee, composed of a distinguished group of minority              faculty with exceptional science research credentials and Associate             Deans from the three sponsoring units.  The Scientific Executive                Committee, will oversee the RCMS Scholars Program and engage in all             decisions regarding its execution, including selection of the                   students who will be designated as UM-RCMS Scholars each year and               selecting research mentors most appropriate for these students.                                                                                                 The primary direct benefits will be an increase in research and                 mentoring opportunities for talented students.                                                                                                                       1.   Um-RCMS will provide a forty percent increase in the                            available placements for visiting students in our Summer                        Research program, most of which are now directed toward                         SEM field.                                                                                                                                                 2.   UM-RCMS will permit a doubling of the full year                                 placements available for University of Michigan                                 undergraduate students in Science, Engineering and                              Mathematics, and the opening of such positions for the                          first time to juniors and seniors in SEM fields such as                         Geology, Astronomy, Biology, and Economics.                                                                                                                3.   UM-RCMS will enable the University to make a significant                        increase in the duration and quality of the research and                        mentoring experience available to the most talented                             students in the SEM fields.                                                                                                                           Extended benefits will be realized by faculty and students at the               University of Michigan, by the University as a whole and the                    communities it serves, and by colleges and Universities which have              joined in partnerships with the University in order to increase the             diversity of this nation's academic and scientific community.",
