 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication is an essential process in the development of                     science.  Without communication of results, it is impossible for                science to advance, for positions to be challenged, etc.  The                   \"scientific paper\" has been the traditional means of communication,             but to say this leaves out the content.  In fact, each scientific               specialty is unique in the development of its own system of                     communication.  Mathematicians may communicate using numbers and                symbols; anatomists may communicate by using drawings (rather than              photographs) of organs and their parts.  Recently, communications               have changed in molecular biology.  With the advent of genome                   sequencing projects, a whole electronic network has been                        established to communicate long strings (sequences) of letters                  constituting the letters of DNA sequences.  The current network                 allows only letter after letter to be listed.  With the development             of faster computers, etc., these communications should be sent out              in a two dimensional format where the position of sequences of DNA              can be shown in relationship to each other.                                                                                                                     One of the most important issues of the social study of science and             technology is how these communications conventions develop.  How is             it that molecular biologists agree that a particular sequence of                letters is meaningful?  How is it that physicists accept electrical             displays in a cloud chamber as communication proving the existence,             say, of a quark?  It is this process that Dr. Van Helden is                     examining. He is looking at a critical time in the development of               a new language of communication in one of the most ancient of                   sciences:  astronomy.  Before the advent of the telescope,                      astronomy was a science communicated by words, mathematical                     symbols, and diagrams, but not by naturalistic representations of               the heavenly body.  The telescope, however, revealed celestial                  phenomena that were often impossible fully to describe in words,                and therefore astronomers had to learn to communicate information               by means of pictures drawn by the observer and reproduced as                    accurately as possible.  Dr. Van Helden is studying the process by              which these pictures were first developed and how this visual                   language gradually came to be accepted.  He hopes to show how a                 fully articulated visual language, including the many essential                 conventions, was developed and became standard in the astronomical              community.  In order to complete this project, Dr. Van Helden is                examining original manuscripts with their illustrations contained               in libraries in London, Leiden, Paris, and Florence.",
