The exploratory work will involve the design of a testbed for              simulating and analyzing the cooperative design process and for                 experimenting with strategies for its decision support.  The domain             for this work is the simultaneous process selection and design for              manufacturability of thin-walled parts.  Interaction with                       industrial sponsors will be used to extend the work to other                    environments.",
