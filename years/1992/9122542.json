 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to investigate genetic and demographic effects of human-             induced population subdivision on the wood frog (Rana sylvatica),               an aquatic-breeding, terrestrial-dwelling amphibian of mesic                    woodlands.  Our study will examine patterns of genetic variation                within and divergence among 25 subpopulations of wood frogs in a                heavily urbanized area of southern Connecticut, U.S.A., where                   subpopulations vary widely in size (10-1,000 individuals), length               of isolation (O, 10, 100, and 10,000 years), and degree of habitat              connectivity.  Features of the landscape intervening subpopulations             will be correlated with estimates of genetic similarity between                 subpopulations to examine which geographic features act as barriers             versus paths to gene flow.  A novel experimental procedure,                     involving placement of artificial breeding pools in selected                    landscape configurations, will be used to assess the \"porosity\" of              human-created barriers to disperse froglets.  An examination of how             habitat and population fragmentation has proceeded in the study                 area during the last century (by inspection of maps and aerial                  photographs) will aid in understanding how both zoogeographic                   factors and historical demography shaped population-level                       phylogenies of wood frogs.  Such information is of particular                   interest to conservation biologists. who are increasingly concerned             with long-term maintenance of genetic diversity in artificially                 fragmented populations.",
