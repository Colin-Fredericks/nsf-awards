 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary aim of this project is to create a modern                           laboratory environment for the introductory physics student in                  which the student is allowed to focus his or her attention as                   completely as possible on the physics of the system under                       study.  A secondary aim of this project is to create a                          technologically literate introductory student.  These have                      meant removing the distractions of poorly functioning                           equipment, outmoded data collection techniques, and                             mathematical tedium.  These have meant adding the support of                    up-to-date computers, electronic data collection via a variety                  of transducers, and software for sophisticated data analysis.                   This new laboratory environment has been put into place and it                  allows the student to identify more easily the underlying                       physical principles in a wider range of real-world phenomena                    than was possible with the previously existing equipment, thus                  the students understanding of physics and its relevance to his                  or her own field of interest has been improved.  Care has been                  exercised in the design of laboratory experiments so that the                   student can use the power of this technologically advanced                      equipment without treating it as just another blackbox.  In                     achieving the aims of this project, one ensures that the                        physics student of today will approach the problems of tomorrow                 with a better grasp of physical principles underlying those                     problems and of the technology necessary to solve them.",
