 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in              applied mathematics.  The investigators are Christopher I. Byrnes,              T.J. Tarn and Alberto Isidori of Washington University in St.                   Louis and Jean-Pierre Aubin of the University of Paris-Dauphine.                The objective of their research is to utilize and coordinate diverse            methodologies in algebraic and differential equations for resolving             problems on the regulation and control of nonlinear systems.  They              will study output regulation, stabilization of systems by feedback              and system tracking.  Dr. Byrnes and his group at the University of             Washington bring to this collaboration expertise in applying                    differential geometry to theories of nonlinear control.  This is                complemented by the French group's algebraic approach to                        problems in nonlinear systems.  The project will benefit from the               synthesis of the different methodologies and theories.                                                                                                          The problem of controlling or influencing nonlinear systems is of               interest to researchers in industry.  For example, in the aerospace             industry, flight control systems for aircraft are nonlinear systems,            where small changes can affect performance.  The methodology                    developed by these researchers could be applied to control                      problems for wind shear in take-off and landing.  This research                 will also advance our understanding of fundamental theories on                  nonlinear systems and modern control theory.",
