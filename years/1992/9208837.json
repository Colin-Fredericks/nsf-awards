The investigators plan on                              determining the duration of the persistence of this                             nucleic acid after the virus has lost its ability to                            infect cell cultures.                                                                                                                                           This proposal was submitted to NSF under conditions                             outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory                             Research (SGER).  Results of prior studies reporting the                        presence of nucleic acids \"homologous\" to the Human                             Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in wastewater concentrates                         suggest the importance of determining whether these                             nucleic acids are degraded after the ability of this virus                      to infect cell cultures has been lost.  This, in turn,                          would assist in assessing the potential of infectious                           viral transmission through environmental media.",
