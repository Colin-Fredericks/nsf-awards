 "awd_abstract_narration": "A basic property of sensory systems is the opponent, center-surround            organization of individual receptive fields of neurons. This                    organization results from the convergence of inputs from separate               sensory cells, some of which contribute excitation, and others                  contribute inhibition.  A single sensory cell in the leech synapses             with a motoneuron involved in a simple reflex. This sensory cell                generates an opponent receptive field in the motor neuron by means              of conduction block and an inhibitory interneuron.  Experiments                 being conducted under this award use electrophysiological recording             and stimulation, marking of cells with intracellular tracers, laser             microsurgery and electron microscopy to characterize the                        distribution and nature of synaptic contacts involved in the reflex             connection and to analyze integration of those inputs by                        postsynaptic neurons.                                                                                                                                           These experiments should reveal activity-dependent mechanisms that              influence qualitative properties of the mechanosensory receptive                field and the reflex connections of which it is a part.  They will              also help understand how postsynaptic cells such as motor neurons               integrate sensory signals to reach threshold for firing action                  potentials and provide insight into the mechanisms by which cell                geometry, particularly axonal and dendritic branching, influence                neural signalling.",
