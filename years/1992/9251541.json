 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most recent labor studies predict a shortage of health                          physicists during the next several decades.  Failure to prevent                 this shortage will leave the United States in a disadvantage in                 a number of areas: nuclear power, radiological waste                            management, nuclear medicine, etc.  One solution to this                        shortage is to expand existing training programs and to create                  new training programs.  Another solution is to improve the                      effectiveness of the training programs.  A major part of health                 physics training is devoted to learning how to use radiation                    detection and monitoring instruments.  This is accomplished by:                 1) using instruments and radioactive sources in a classroom                     laboratory situation, and/or, 2) on-the-job training.                                                                                                           This project is developing an innovative new approach to                        laboratory training in health physics, i.e., the development of                 a computer simulator that can be used in place of actual                        radiation sources in laboratory training.  Such a simulator                     will result in much lower cost of training, provide for a wider                 variety of training situations, and eliminate the safety                        hazards associated with actual radiation sources.  We are                       building a computer system that will simulate the presence of                   various types of radiation sources in a variety of                              environments.  This system, based on the IBM PC, will have                      three modules, Surveyor, Radiation Physics Laboratory, and                      Examination.  The Surveyor will simulate an environment where                   radiation exposure potential exists.  This environment will                     include pre-defined locations (known or unknown to the trainee)                 of radiation sources (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Neutron) and the                   ability to simulate the radiation level at any given point in                   the radiation environment.  This module will be connected                       (through a digital to analog converter) to an actual instrument                 (or facade) so that the trainee can hold the instrument in                      his/her hand.  The Radiation Physics Laboratory module will                     teach the principles of various types of radiation and the                      Examination module, based on the Surveyor, will test the                        knowledge of the trainee of the properties of various types of                  radiation and the ability of the trainee in the radiation                       environment.                                                                                                                                                    A simulator of this type will have far reaching effects on the                  health physics industry.  It will streamline the way health                     physics professionals are trained and will facilitate an                        increase in the number of personnel trained in the health                       physics discipline.  In addition, this system will be used to                   train personnel working in and around potential hazards, will                   improve their understanding of the principles of radiation                      physics and radiation protection and will decrease the cost of                  training.",
