 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychological researchers often administer more than one                   measure during the same research session in order to test                       hypothesized relationships among contructs.  However,  initial                  measures might influence subjects in ways that affect their                     responses to subsequent measures.  Demonstrations of such \"context              effects\"  have important methodological implications,  since                    correlations obtained in studies that fail to control for context               effects may significantly differ from those obtained with proper                controls.                                                                            Three studies are proposed in order to demonstrate that the                phenomenon is robust and should be of general concern in research               on personality and individual differences.  Two basic conditions                will be employed:  In the Same Context condition,  measures will                be administered together in one research session,   so that                     subjects may infer an association.  In the Separate Context                     condition,  scales will be administered in separate sessions,  as               parts of independent studies.  Thus,  subjects will be unlikely to              perceive any connection  among them.  Three established                         relationships will be investigated to determine whether                         relationships have been confounded by context effects:  a)                      hypnotizability and absorption;  b)  depression and attributional               style;  and c) childhood traumata and adult personality.                             Professor Council is an internationally known scholar in the               area of hypnosis research.  His proposal to test for the presence               of context effects in several different substantive areas is of                 considerable importance.  Much work on  personality,  social                    psychology,  and psychopathology consists of studying relationships             between measures obtained from subjects on a single occasion.                   Thus,  if context effects are shown to contribute significantly to              relationships between measures,  many well-known facts may turn out             to be artifactual. Likewise, the experimental results may  lead to              a change in the methodologies customarily employed to collect                   information in these fields and may spur new theoretical                        investigations.",
