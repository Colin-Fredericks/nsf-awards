 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a series of short and long-term visits to               Japan by students and faculty located at the Center for Microbial               Ecology at Michigan State University.  These visits will be under               the auspices of a five-year agreement that the Center has with                  the Japan Research and Development Corporation (JRDC).  The joint               research project is headed by Professor James Tiedje, Director of               the MSU Center for Microbial Ecology at the University of                       Michigan and Professor Keiji Yano at the Nagaoka University of                  Technology.  In Japan the research will be preformed at Nagaoka                 University of Technology and at the Institute for Physical and                  Chemical Research (RIKEN) in the Tokyo area.  The Center for                    Microbial Ecology is dedicated to understanding the underlying                  principles of microbial and function of microorganisms in natural               and managed habitats.  Research projects will include identifying               microbes that have some ability to degrade pollutants, examining                the genetic chemistry that gives them that ability and                          determining what evolutionary changes may be taking place to make               them more effective.                                                                                                                                            Research results should reveal new information about natural gene               transfer among microbial species.  Although the focus of the                    research is on basic knowledge, it is also expected to produce                  practical benefits in areas of environmental protection such as                 the microbial degradation of toxic wastes, groundwater quality,                 plant productivity and the regulation of agricultural and                       environmental biotechnologies.  Americans are generally                         acknowledged leaders in microbial ecology whereas the Japanese's                expertise lies in the area of molecular biology of genes involved               in biodegradation.  It is expected that this research, and the                  exchanges, will provide intellectually and culturally broadening                experiences for every researcher taking part in the program.",
