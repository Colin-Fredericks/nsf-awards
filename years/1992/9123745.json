 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been a longstanding debate as to the rate at which our                ancestors, the australopithecines, matured and developed.  Some                 say they had a long period of childhood dependency as we do;                    others say they followed the development pattern of modern apes,                while others propose a unique pattern.  The resolution of this                  debate will tell us much about the evolution of learning ability                and culture, for a long childhood dependency accompanies the need               for a long period of learning.  This dissertation improvement                   project will help to clarify the issue by carrying out extensive                examination of the one relatively complete australopithecine of                 juvenile age - Laetoli Hominid 21.  Metric and non-metric aspects               of the skeleton will be compared with samples of modern apes and                humans and thereby give us a better picture of the developmental                pattern in this ancestral form.",
