 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is directed at providing teachers with a direct                   \"hands-on\" experience with field science.  The program is                       designed to involve 180 teachers in grades 5-8 in summer and                    academic year workshops on marine biology and provide them                      with opportunities to engage in research emphasizing the use                    of mathematics for problem solving in science.  During the                      summer the teachers will be involved in field experiences in                    biology and marine mammal science that will expose them to                      data gathering and research methodology. Teachers will develop                  knowledge and skills in hypothesis formation, data collection,                  and analysis.  The teachers will build on the summer                            experience during the academic year by being involved in                        curriculum development and the development of computer                          simulations, analysis programs and approaches and models which                  they adapt to classroom situations to make science interesting                  and exciting for their students.  The approach is                               interdisciplinary emphasizing the use of mathematics in                         science.",
