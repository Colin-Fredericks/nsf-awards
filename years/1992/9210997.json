 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the attractive generality of domain independent planning                techniques, their inefficiency has severely hampered the attempts               to scale them to complex real world planning domains.  One very                 promising solution to this involves enabling the planner to improve             performance from experience by reusing previously generated plans               to solve new planning problems.  Developing effective plan reuse                frameworks is thus currently a very active area of research in                  automated planning, machine learning and case based reasoning                   communities.  Successful design of such planning systems requires               a thorough understanding of the fundamental tradeoffs between                   storage, retrieval and modification in plan reuse.  In the previous             work, a domain independent planning framework called PRAIR which                facilitates flexible modification of existing plans to solve new                planning problems in the context of hierarchical least commitment               planning has been developed.  Experiments with PRAIR have                       demonstrated its potential to bring about order of magnitude                    improvements in planning performance by incrementally modifying                 existing plans in a variety of domains.  PRAIR framework thus                   promises to be an ideal test bed for investigating the issues of                utility of reuse.  This research, a unified reuse framework is                  proposed based on PRAIR modification framework, an is used to study             the utility tradeoffs involved in plan reuse  This framework will               also be used to study ways of integrating reuse with other speedup              learning techniques such as abstraction and search control rules.               The effectiveness of the resulting reuse framework will be                      demonstrated by experimenting with the classical planning domains               and more complex real world applications such as process planning.              Results from this research will help to design plan reuse                       frameworks with demonstrably favorable utility tradeoffs thereby                facilitating scaling up of domain independent planning techniques               to more complex domains.  This research will thus have a                        significant impact on automated planning, machine learning, and                 case based reasoning communities.                                                  //",
