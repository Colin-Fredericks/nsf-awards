 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is to examine the effects of             pregnancy loss on birthspacing patterns in women of Matlab Thana,               Bangladesh.  Special attention will be paid to how the risk of                  pregnancy loss varies among women, the effects of maternal age on               the risk of loss, and the stage of gestation at which loss occurs.              A sample of 375 women will be monitored over an eleven-month                    period, and urine samples will be collected from them twice a week.             The study will use new, highly sensitive assays of urinary                      chorionic gonadotropin, which allow detection of pregnancy within               a few days of conception.  These assays will permit the first                   community-wide study of early pregnancy loss ever to be conducted.              It is necessary to carry out this research in a developing country              because, in western women, the relevant patterns are obscured by                family planning.  This research is of theoretical importance in                 elucidating the factors that determine reproductive rates under                 conditions of natural fertility.  It is also of clinical importance             in developing methods for the identification of women at high risk              of pregnancy loss, and in counseling older women who wish to become             pregnant.",
