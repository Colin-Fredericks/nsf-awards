 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his investigation                 of problems in integral geometry and related areas of geometric                 analysis. He will attempt to extend his earlier work on the                     maximal flat transform on a symmetric space of compact type to                  construct all symmetric coverings of such spaces. He will also                  study integrals attached to the distinguished class of maximally                curved spheres and look for higher homotopy group information.                       This award will support research in the general area of                    integral geometry. The geometry of a set may often be analyzed                  and described by a decomposition of the set into slices. The                    geometry of the slices is often fairly simple and easy to                       describe. The main difficulty in the analysis is usually the                    reconstruction of the underlying geometric features of the entire               set from the geometry of the slices. One well know application of               this area of mathematics is the CAT scan.",
