The following are scheduled to                give one-hour addresses:  W.P. Thurston, S.C. Ferry, D.L.                       Sumners, L.G. Oversteegen, J.D. Stasheff, S.E. Newhouse, Jan van                Mill, F.X. Connolly, F.A. Raymond, Mike Reed, and Dmitri                        Shakmatov.  There will be an additional dozen half-hour talks and               numerous fifteen-minute talks.  Attendance in excess of two                     hundred is expected.                                                                 The series of conferences of which this is the latest member               have become important annual events for topologisis,                            particularly, but not exclusively (as the above roster                          indicates), those in general topology, point-set topology and                   continua theory.  The proceedings will be published in Topology                 Proceedings, a refereed research journal published by Auburn                    University.  The external conference advisory committee consists                of Morton Brown (University of Michigan), Peter J. Nyikos                       (University of South Carolina), Mary Ellen Rudin (University of                 Wisconsin), and Richard B. Sher (University of North Carolina at                Greensboro).                                                                         A novel aspect of this year's conference is the one-day                    conference on issues in mathematical education to be held April                 1, the day immediately before the regular sessions begin.  This                 will capitalize on William Thurston's presence and his interest                 in such issues.  Other more usual aspects of the conference                     arrangements seem equally well thought out.",
