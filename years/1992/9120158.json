 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Henry Taube, Chemistry Department, Stanford University,                     supported by an award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                     Organometallic Program, will conduct research in three areas.                   First, he will study vanadium complexes in non-aqueous                          solvents.  The effects of back-bonding on the chemistry of                      V(II) will be explored using acetonitrile as a solvent, but                     some effort will also be devoted to characterizing the higher                   oxidation states of vanadium and generating higher oxidation                    state species by aerobic oxidation.  The second area is the                     study of mixed valence molecules.  Here work on molecular                       hysteresis will continue.  In specific systems in which                         electron transfer is accompanied by structural change, light of                 energy corresponding to that of the mixed valence band will be                  used to convert one isomeric form to the other and determine                    the efficiency of the conversion.  Also, molecules based on                     aromatic poly-ring systems with osmiumammines bound in the                      eta-2, -4 or -6 modes will be investigated.  Linkage isomerism                  in mixed valence molecules based on simple derivatives of                       benzene will be studied.  In the third area, the mechanism of                   activation for substitution on a ligand by a co-ligand which is                 an oxidizing agent will be explored.  The particular system                     will involve cyclopentadienone bound to Ru(II), the effect of                   which on the rate of substitution of co-ligand                                  cyclopentadienide has been measured.                                            %%%                                                                             These fundamental studies involve electron transfer and                         substitution reactions of transition metal complexes of                         vanadium, ruthenium and osmium.  The results of these studies                   are relevant to the mechanism of action of catalysts for                        organic reactions and to conversion of solar to electrical                      energy.",
