 "awd_abstract_narration": "Community Television of Southern California (KCET/Los Angeles)                  proposes to create a national television series supported by                    outreach activities designed to motivate parents to participate                 in and support children's learning and enjoyment of mathematics.                This proposal requests National Science Foundation funding of $1                million towards a total twenty-two month project costing                        approximately $1.7 million.                                                                                                                                     The proposed television series Math Smart (working title) will                  include 5 lively half-hour programs designed specifically to aid                parents and other adult family members of children in first                     through third grade.  The series will be offered for broadcast                  nationally on the Public Broadcasting System (PBS).                             Videocassettes of the series and an accompanying Resource Guide                 will also be made available for home use.  National promotional                 and outreach activities will complement the PBS broadcast,                      including presentations of national educational conferences and                 one-day orientation workshops for parents and teachers at                       selected sites.  Over the course of the project, process and                    outcome evaluation will be conducted to ensure the effectiveness                of the MATH SMART materials and activities.                                                                                                                     The primary goal of the MATH SMART Project is to empower parents                to participate in and reinforce the learning of mathematics and                 a vital par t of everyday life.  It is from parents that                        children develop the foundation for their educational success.                  Unfortunately, many parents do not possess the mathematical                     skills or confidence needed to help their children.  By                         providing examples of hands-on learning activities which                        families can do together at home, MATh SMART offers parents the                 tools to help excite young children about mathematics.  While                   special emphasis will be given to encouraging minority                          participation, this project seeks to help all parents and other                 primary caretakers prepare children for the 21st century.",
