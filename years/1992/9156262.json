 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently, many implementations of multimedia into a community                  college involve using commercially produced laser disc                          technology.  The results from this type of implementation have                  been excellent (Miles, 1990).  But this community college                       environment requires addressing the specific cultural,                          vocabulary, and nontechnical background of the students. The                    campus is a Community College branch of the New Mexico State                    system and serves a population which is 65% women, 24% Native                   American, and 26% Hispanic. Satellite programs are held on                      nearby reservations where the population is 99% Native                          American. The Branch, therefore, will produce its own                           interactive video material (Griffith, 1988; McCool, 1984).                      Until the recent development of the PC-VCR, the cost for                        developing interactive video presentations in-house was                         prohibitive.  The general procedure for this institution is to                  integrate interactive video systems, in-house production                        facilities, and the creative talent of Branch faculty and                       students.  Implementation will affect four major areas: the                     Computer Literacy course, presentations to public and                           reservation schools, the Branch faculties class preparation                     work, and the Branch students' assignment preparation.",
