 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to provide funding for sixteen faculty members             from minority and women's institutions to attend the 1992 Snowbird              Conference of the Computing Research Association, and for four                  individuals identified by the Computing Research Association to                 participate in the 1992 Conference of the Association of Department             Heads of Computer Science and Engineering at Minority Institutions.             This is an extremely worthwhile endeavor which should establish                 lasting links between the major research institutions in computer               science and the group of institutions that service a significant                number of students from underrepresented populations in computer                science and engineering.  It is critical that more individuals from             underrepresented populations become involved in research activities             in computer science and engineering, and this project represents a              strong effort in that direction.",
