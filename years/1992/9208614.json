 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of electrosynthesis.  It is part of               a joint National Science Foundation/Electric Power Research                     Institute program of research on electrochemical synthesis.                     During the tenure of this three-year standard grant, Professors                 Natan and Allara and their students will carry out experimental                 studies of the extent to which structured interfaces can be used                to induce selectivity in electrosynthetic processes.  Three                     research thrusts will be pursued: electrocatalysis at conducting                inorganic materials, enantioselective electrochemistry at chiral                self-assembled monolayers and at chiral semiconductors, and                     functionalization of gallium arsenide with organothiolate films.                In the first two thrusts, the electrode structure is tailored to                function in a highly specific way using established criteria from               biological and organic chemistry.  The research on gallium                      arsenide is exploratory and capitalizes on recent discoveries in                the principal investigators' laboratories.  All three thrusts                   involve extensive characterization of the electrochemical                       interface using both in situ and ex situ techniques.                            %%%                                                                             This research should lead to an enhanced understanding of those                 factors which control chiral electrosynthesis.  The successful                  attainment of the goals of this project could enable the design of              efficient and environmentally benign electrosynthetic routes to                 the production of specialty chemicals.",
