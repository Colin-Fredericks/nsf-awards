 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical investigations will be carried out on two-dimensional               quantum semiconductor systems studying effects of disorder, finite              temperatures and unique device structures with and without a                    magnetic field.  The behavior of edges in the Wigner crystal regime             in a strong magnetic field will be considered and a method for                  calculating relaxation, reconstruction and melting of the edge                  electrons under various circumstances will be studied.  The                     consequences of transport and electromagnetic absorption of such                effects will be considered.  A detailed study of defects in the                 Wigner crystal  will be undertaken using a variational wavefunction             approach which should help determine the importance of quantum                  fluctuations and will be a first step in understanding both the                 melting transition and finite temperature transport.  Edge states               in the quantum Hall regime will be studied with emphasis on the                 effects disorder may have on the low-lying excitations of such                  systems.  Finally, a careful study of the influence of potential                inhomogeneities in a two-layer system on interplane tunneling will              be undertaken.                                                                  %%%                                                                             This theoretical study will focus on the properties of a new state              of matter associated with a gas of strongly interacting electrons               confined to two-dimensions.  Usually this state of matter is found              at the semiconductor interface in a strong magnetic field.  One                 possible outcome of this electron gas is to condense into a                     crystalline state, the Wigner crystal.  The research will study the             behavior of this Wigner crystal.  Besides being of fundamental                  physical interest, there may be ramifications of this research on               microelectronics.",
