 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents an accomplishment based renewal for                     continuing studies of upwelling new production processes.  The                  major goals are to test hypotheses developed from coastal and                   equatorial measurements and to modify current models of upwelling               system new production accordingly.  The region selected for the                 study is Monterey Bay where nitrogen uptake has been measured at 2              weeks intervals for 2 years.  The seasonal cycle shows an                       alternation between open ocean and upwelling conditions allowing a              comparison of the 2 regimes, one expected to show open ocean,                   oligotrophic characteristics and the other eutrophic coastal                    upwelling parameters.  The project seeks to understand the factors              which trigger the transition from the one ecosystem to the other.               The basic hypothesis is that the process of nitrate incorporation               into the primary producers is the key factor in determining the                 trophic status of a marine ecosystem.  Further, previous results                indicate that the critical factors in development of new production             of bloom proportions are nitrate concentration and ambient                      irradiance.  These 2 factors set boundaries for the acceleration                process between low new production conditions and high new                      production.  The results of this project will contribute to global              models of new production and its impact on carbon cycling.  The                 results should be especially helpful in understanding the role of               upwelling ecosystems in global new production and carbon cycling.",
