 "awd_abstract_narration": "The abundance of arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) and other                    glycoconjugates at the interface between the plasma membrane and                the cell wall of rose cells suggests that these molecules serve as              mediating agents between the surfaces of these two distinct                     structures.  This hypothesis will be tested on whole cells and                  model systems by analyzing the effect of perturbations of AGPs on               both lateral diffusion of plasma membrane components and on linear              motion between the plasma membrane and cell wall.  Characteristics              of these types of motions will be determined as a function of                   turgor or applied pressure.  Perturbations of AGPs will include                 aggregation, enzymatic cleavage, and altered synthesis.  Such                   characterization will provide further information on the effects                of both turgor and AGPs on membrane dynamics.  Enzymes capable of               cleaving plasma membrane AGPs on live protoplasts will be further               purified and their mode of action elucidated.  Analysis of the                  biochemical structure of plasma membrane AGPs and molecules that                copurify with plasma membrane AGPs during isolation will also be                conducted.  Structural analysis of plasma membrane AGPs will                    include determination of glycosyl linkage composition, predominant              anomeric configurations, and amino terminal sequence. The                       biochemical studies will provide important information towards                  understanding the role of AGPs as mediating agents or/and as                    specific recognition molecules during development.                                                                                                              The cell walls of plants are complex extracellular matrix                       structures containing protein and polysaccharide components, the                detailed organization of which is largely unknown.  As a result of              the cellular high water pressure state known as turgor, the plasma              membrane must be tightly appressed to the wall by about 7                       atmospheres of pressure.  However, the components of the membrane               must be free to undergo rapid lateral diffusion, even while                     appressed against the wall.  This is particularly true during cell              growth.  A number of protein-linked glycoconjugates have been found             in the plasma membrane, the carbohydrate portion of which is                    external to the cell and extends between the membrane and the wall.             Some of these are analogous to proteoglycans of animal cell                     membranes.  The functions of these are totally unknown.  This                   project will explore functional and structural aspects of one group             of these glycoconjugates, the arabinogalactans, with the hypothesis             in mind that the arabinogalactans may serve as physical mediators               or cushions between the membrane and the wall of plant cells.",
