 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal provides a plan for improving the quality of                      laboratory instruction and assessment techniques in the middle                  school. More specifically, the goals of the project are: (a)                    to improve the quality of laboratory instruction at the middle                  school level; (b) to increase the use of practical assessment                   techniques in middle school classrooms; and (c) develop                         leadership teams to inservice and mentor peers. To accomplish                   these goals, 30 middle school teachers in the school system in                  West Lafayette, Indiana will be involved in content,                            pedagogical knowledge based on a laboratory system which                        sequences laboratory instruction.                                                                                                                               The project initially involves 30 teachers that will receive                    direct training throughout the three years of project                           duration. During year three, the thirty teachers will conduct                   staff development programs pyramiding the teacher impact of                     the project. The pyramiding effect has been estimated at 10                     new teachers impacted per original participant for 300 peer-                    trained teachers (30 x 10 = 300). Thus, the project will                        impact 30 teachers plus 300 peer-trained teachers for a total                   of 330 teachers over a three-year period.                                                                                                                       The ultimate goal of the proposal is to provide a laboratory                    instructional system, as well as the training necessary to                      improve laboratory instructional practices and teachers                         attitudes toward laboratory instruction. The system involves                    the teachers in three different types of laboratory                             activities: (1) Confirmation Laboratory Activities which deal                   with direct experience with materials designed to demonstrate                   or verify principles or concepts that have been previously                      discussed and are already part of the teachers experience; (2)                  Generalization Laboratory Activities which provide teachers                     with a wide range of experiences that can be used to link                       direct experience with abstractions - concepts, principles,                     and theories; and (3) Resolution Laboratory Activities which                    engage teachers in problem solving situations that will                         require them to resolve problems in the laboratory. These                       three different types of laboratory experiences will prepare                    teachers in ways to  sequence laboratory activities in their                    classrooms to better achieve conceptual understanding of                        science by their students.                                                                                                                                      Cost sharing is equivalent to 6% of the NSF award.",
