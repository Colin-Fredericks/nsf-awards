 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the proposed research is to delineate                the mechanism of opsonin-mediated cell recognition of nonself in                insects.  The hemolymph lectin of the beet armyworm having                      characteristics similar to those reported for soluble vertebrate                lectins, has been demonstrated to e an effective opsonin of fungal              cells.  Based on prior experiments we believe that when the S.                  exigua lectin binds to the fungal wall, it undergoes a                          conformational change, exposing sites which bind to receptors on                the hemocyte membrane.  Initial experiments will examine the                    ability of 125I-labeled S. exigua lectin-substrate complexes to                 bind to hemocyte monolayers.  Secondly, S. exigua lectin affinity               matrices will be utilized to pluck the receptors from labeled                   hemocytes and identify the receptor complex present in the hemocyte             cell membrane.  The data generated form these experiments will                  provide novel information as to how humoral lectins operate as                  opsonins or transport molecules in insects.                                                                                                                     This proposal addresses a fundamental issue in insect immunology.               The prevailing belief in the field is that lectins, proteins which              recognize and bind specific carbohydrate structures, function as                immune surveillance proteins in the primitive insect circulatory                system, much as immunoglobulin antibodies recognize and bind                    specific haptenic structures in the vertebrate circulatory system.              The hypothesis being explored in this project is that, once bound,              the lectin \"opsonizes\" the pathogen much as antibodies opsonize                 bacteria, enabling phagocytic cells of the immune system to                     recognize the antibody-antigen complex and to engulf and degrade                the invading microorganism.  The results of this research will                  expand our understanding of the role of lectins in invertebrate                 immune responses.",
