The report will both                    emphasize the relevance of employing rigorous statistical and                   probabilistic techniques in software engineering contexts, and                  delineate opportunities for further research in this                            direction.  It will address education and training of software                  engineers in statistical methodology, and of statisticians                      interested in software engineering.  The panel will be                          composed of software engineers (including human factors                         specialists), applied probabilists, and statisticians.  The                     report will influence software engineering by exhibiting                        methods for assessing software productivity, quality,                           reliability, risk, safety, and management of software                           development process.  It will outline a program of research in                  the statistical sciences and their applications to software                     engineering.  As a subsidiary benefit, this report will                         influence other closely related disciplines, e.g., applied                      mathematics, operations research, computer science, systems                     engineering, industrial engineering, and quality control.",
