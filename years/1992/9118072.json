 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ribosome is the unique site of protein biosynthesis in all                  cells, and as such a detailed understanding of its structure                    and function is of fundamental importance to the more general                   understanding of cellular function at the molecular level.  The                 long term goal of work in this laboratory is to create a                        detailed structure-function map of the ribosome.  The work put                  forward in this proposal is an important part of this effort,                   since it provides a uniquely powerful approach for obtaining a                  detailed picture of the ribosomal components that neighbor                      specific sequences of rRNA within intact ribosomes and                          subunits.  Specifically, The PI proposes to exploit                             radioactive, photolabile, complementary oligoDNA probes of                      ribosomal RNA (rRNA) as photoaffinity labels to identify                        ribosomal components that neighbor targeted rRNA sequences                      within an intact ribosome or ribosomal subunit and to determine                 how the identities of such components vary in different                         functional sites of the ribosome. The secondary structures of                   rRNA are well established.  The targeted sequences fall in                      single-stranded regions having particular functional or                         structural significance, including those known or suspected to                  be involved in the peptidyl transferase center, in the                          anticodon-codon recognition center, in 30S:50S subunit                          contacts, and in the binding of specific ribosomal ligands such                 as protein factors that stimulate protein synthesis (e.g.,EF-                   G,IF3) and of antibiotics.  These studies will be carried out                   on the E. coli ribosome, which is by far the best                               characterized.  However, given the considerable conservation of                 ribosome structure throughout evolution, the results obtained                   should also be useful for understanding ribosomes from other                    organisms.",
