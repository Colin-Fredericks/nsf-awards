 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ronald Lawrenz is the Director of the St. Croix Watershed                  Research Station, which is located near St. Paul along the St.                  Croix River and operated by the Science Museum of Minnesota.  The               St. Croix River is recognized under the National Wild and Scenic                Rivers Act, and is therefore an important resource for research                 and public education.  The Station was established in 1989 and                  has undergone significant growth in the number of research                      projects and long-term ecological monitoring programs facilitated               by the Station.  Mr. Lawrenz has planned expansion of the                       Station's facilities to serve the growing use of the Station by                 research scientists.  These improvements include installation of                a meteorological monitoring station, and development of a clearer               research identity for the Station through workshops that bring                  together ecological scientists in the regions.                                       The planned meteorological monitoring station will initiate                a long-term data record that will be of value to countless future               research projects, ranging from wildlife management to global                   climate change.  The planning workshops will help to guide the                  future growth trajectory of the Station.  The St. Croix Watershed               is an area with potential for research projects with national and               international implications.  These improvements will promote the                Station's rapid growth and future success.",
