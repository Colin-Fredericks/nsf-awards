 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed conference is the second of a planned series on snow               engineering that began in 1988.  These meetings provide a forum for             engineers, architects, and scientists to discuss investigative and              design methods to mitigate natural hazards imposed by snow on                   buildings and other structures.  The nature, distribution, and                  statistics of snow loads must be better understood to improve                   building design criteria and mitigate damage.                                                                                                                   The conference will attract people from a wide diversity of                     backgrounds and provide a unique setting for interchanging ideas,               opinions, and working knowledge of snow engineering.  Using series              of plenary sessions, workshops, poster sessions, and panel                      discussions participants will discuss field measurements, wind                  tunnel studies, artificial environments, analytical methods, snow               mechanics, as well as design problems and building standards/codes.             The conference proceedings will contain papers by invited speakers,             workshop position papers, short poster papers, and transcripts of               panel discussions.",
