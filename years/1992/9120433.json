 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are a variety of ways of exploring the brain basis of                     psychological abilities such as visual attention.  One of these                 approaches is to study how the postnatal development of cortical                circuits gives rise to the onset of components of visual                        attention in the human infant.  Due to the importance of visual                 attention in early infancy, it is evident that this approach may                also be of clinical benefit.  Furthermore, an understanding of                  the relation between postnatal cortical development and the                     emergence of cognitive abilities would clearly be a major advance               for both developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience.                                                                                                   This research program is designed to test predictions of                        Johnson's theory about the relation between cortical maturation                 and the development of visual attention.  This theory uses                      developmental neuroanatomical evidence to predict the sequence in               which certain cortical circuits become functional.  Since these                 circuits are thought to subserve components of visual attention,                this allows predictions to be made about their developmental                    sequence.  In human infants between 2 and 6 months of age these                 predictions will be tested by studying performance in certain                   tasks known to be specifically sensitive to the functioning of                  these cortical pathways.  In addition, new \"marker tasks\" will be               developed to make possible the investigation of \"covert\" visual                 attention i.e. shifts of attention that are independent of eye                  movements.  Finally, work will be done on developing a                          standardized infant visual attention screening test.  This test                 will subsequently be used in conjunction with neuroimaging                      techniques to investigate directly the neural basis of visual                   attention during infancy.",
