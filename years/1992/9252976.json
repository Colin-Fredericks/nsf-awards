 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a set of 100-200 haptic diagrams in                    the area of life science for use by blind, visually                             impaired, learning disabled, and at risk students, grades                       3-7.  These raised line diagrams will utilize differing                         textures and brailled labels along with auditory tapes,                         brailled text, and ink print text to provide further                            information about the content of the diagram.  Teachers will                    be able to select from the available materials to respond to                    the learning modalities of students found in a mainstreamed                     classroom.  Supplemental print materials for the teacher                        will provide follow-up activities that are designed to                          engage print-disabled students in hands-on, inquiry                             learning.  These materials are intended for use in                              cooperative learning settings in the regular education                          classroom to decrease the isolation of disabled students and                    increase their interest and participation in science.                                                                                                           The topics for the diagrams will be selected for their                          compatibility with the most commonly used science textbooks                     and with the overarching themes of Science For All                              Americans.  Topics will include earth science, biology,                         ecology, and human biology.                                                                                                                                     The materials will be field tested over two years in                            California, Texas, New York, and Kentucky.  Dissemination                       will occur through the National Science Teachers                                Association, the \"Special Net\" system of the United States                      Resource Centers and Clearinghouses, and presentations made                     at national conferences for science teachers and teachers of                    blind and visually impaired students.",
