 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to translate advanced technology efficiently                   into manufacturing capacity is crucial under the new paradigm of                industrialization and competition in the world economy.  The                    competitive advantage of countries and regions depends on                       strategies of innovation and organization of production that                    allow for rapid adaptation to changes in the competitive                        environment.  A key question in this process is whether                         regionally focused production systems can be used by developing                 countries in acquiring advanced technologies.  This project will                test the hypothesis that the creation of new industries and                     industrial sectors is influenced not only by technological change               and organizational innovation, but principally by place based                   politics and institutional strategies.  The research will focus                 on three emerging high-technology agglomerations in Sao Paulo                   State in Brazil.  It will attempt to establish the relationship                 between high-technology specialization and government sponsored                 scientific efforts to generate efficient technology search                      procedures for industrial application.  Data will come from                     censuses, industrial surveys, and interviews with individual                    firms.  Data will be analyzed with statistical and cartographic                 techniques to determine whether the hypothesized relationship                   between regional specialization and institutional factors is                    valid.                                                                               This research should provide a framework for addressing the                specific conditions of semi-industrialized countries regarding                  their innovativeness and competitiveness, the role of                           geographically specific factors in this process, and whether                    regionally focused production systems promote advanced                          technological capacity for developing countries.  These questions               are important in determining whether the advent of a global                     economy based on technological competition poses obstacles or                   opportunities for industrial development in less developed                      countries.",
