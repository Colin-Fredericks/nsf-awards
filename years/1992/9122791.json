 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project examine how arctic plant                     communities may respond to global climate change, and the                       consequences that changes in community structure may have for                   ecosystem functioning.  Field manipulations of community                        structure and temperature, combined with growth chamber                         experiments will be used, to determine how the competitive                      interactions of the major tussock tundra species change with                    increased temperature.  Field transplants of major treeline                     species along with seed germination studies will be employed to                 determine the controls over tree migration into tundra.  The                    student will examine how individual species affect system                       processes such as productivity, decomposition and nutrient                      cycling, and CO2 and CH4 flux, using the previously mentioned                   community manipulations, as well as laboratory soil incubations.                The Arctic is an appropriate system for this study because the                  low number of species allows whole-community manipulations.                     Furthermore, dramatic increases in temperature are expected to                  occur at high latitudes in the near future.  This study is                      significant because it links community structure with ecosystem                 processes.                                                                      ** //",
