 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal studies the purification of monoclonal                            antibodies (MAbs). The effort will focus on  the purification                   of  mouse IgG1   and  IgM, and a subfractionation of mouse IgG                  into IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3.  MAbs are produced by either                  the collection of ascites fluid from mice which have been                       injected with hybridoma cells in their peritoneal cavity, or                    by the collection of the nutrient medium in which hybridoma                     cells are cultured in vitro.  Whatever the method,  the                         antibody must be separated from a complex mixture of proteins.                  The proposal  suggests using ion exchange dispacement                           chromatography to effect the purification and                                   subfractionation.  In this method, the feed is first passed                     through a column, and the antibodies adsorb onto the column.                    Experiments will be conducted  on a preparative HPLC system                     using the weak anion exchanger PAE-1000 as the adsorbent.  The                  next step is to displace the adsorbed molecules. The PI                         suggests using dextran sulphates as the displacers. The PI                      will investigate the potential of tailoring the molecular                       weight and charge of dextran sulphates in order to vary the                     affinity of the sulphates to the adsorbent  relative to the                     antibodies. Some of this tailoring will involve synthesis                       since only two molecular weight sulphates are commercially                      available, and each of these at only one sulphate content and                   therefore charge density. Pure component isotherm measurements                  will be undertaken of the MAbs, sulphates and two                               representative contaminating proteins, transferrin and                          albumin. These isotherm measurements will be used to determine                  suitable displacers, and then multicomponent isotherms of the                   displacers, MAbs, transferrin and albumin will be determined.                   Lastly, displacement experiments in the column will  be                         undertaken.",
