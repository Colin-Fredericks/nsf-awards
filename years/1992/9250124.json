 "awd_abstract_narration": "A human-computer interaction laboratory at the Psychology                       Department of the University of Illinois at Urbana is being                     enhanced for students from the fields of Industrial                             Engineering, Human Factors, and Cognitive Science.  The new                     laboratory experiments provide a detailed account of human                      capabilities and limitations affecting interface design in                      general, but giving particular emphasis as it relates to                        computer products.  The state-of-the-art interdisciplinary                      laboratory is oriented to the design and evaluation of human-                   computer interfaces.  Students from Computer Science,                           Psychology, and Industrial Engineering are learning the basic                   concepts, methodology, and skills necessary to evaluate and                     design human-computer interfaces.  The multi-disciplinary                       perspectives that are necessary for the successful design of                    computer products are fostered as part of the educational                       process when students from these different disciplines are                      brought together.",
