Conscience assures that we adhere to                    standards of conduct and restrain antisocial impulses even in the               absence of surveillance.  In the second year of life, parents                   begin to lay foundations for children's conscience by setting and               enforcing standards of desired behavior.  Different child rearing               patterns have been associated with varying outcomes in children's               conscience development.  However, children's individual                         temperamental characteristics, such as vulnerability to anxiety                 and fearfulness, and impulsivity and inhibitory control may                     affect their ability to experience guilt and remorse and the                    capacity to suppress forbidden impulses.  Thus, they may be                     strongly related to aspects of conscience development, and they                 may also moderate the effects of parental socialization.                        Nevertheless, individual differences have been almost entirely                  neglected in the developmental research on conscience.  This                    short term cross-sectional/follow-up study will examine maternal                socialization and child temperament as contributors to the early                formation of conscience at two points critical for its                          development; at Time 1, at 29.40 months (recently proposed as the               period of the emergence of the \"moral self\") and at Time 2, at                  45-55 months (on the verge of the transition to broad social                    systems, when internal standards of conduct take on a particular                developmental significance).  Specifically, mothers' disciplinary               styles, children's fearfulness/anxiety and impulsivity/inhibitory               control, and apsects of children's conscience development will be               measured at both times of assessment with a rich combination of                 methods; naturalistic behavioral observations in multiple                       context, standardized laboratory procedures, parental reports,                  and semi-projective measures.  The study will provide unique                    insights into the complex interplay of socialization and                        temperament in the early development of conscience.",
