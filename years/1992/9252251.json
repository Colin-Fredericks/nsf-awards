 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contemporary techniques in cell and molecular biology are tools                 used to solve problems in all biological sub-disciplines and                    are an integral component of laboratory classes in Cell                         Biology, Molecular Biology, and Genetics.  With the new                         equipment these classes will utilize Southern, Northern, and                    Western analysis, genetic mosaic analysis, DNA transformation,                  polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence microscopy in                  their studies.  All Colorado College biology majors take at                     least two of these courses.  The equipment is also available to                 independent undergraduate research courses and senior thesis                    projects. Students participating in independent or                              collaborative research projects are encouaged to present and                    publish their findings. The requested equipment will allow the                  Department to fulfill its plan to expand its offerings and                      provide students with hands-on experience in the growing field                  of biotechnology.",
