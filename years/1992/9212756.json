 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the United States, paid advocates are usually members of the                 legal profession.  In many arenas, lawyers enjoy a legally                      enforceable monopoly on such representation; in other arenas,                   lawyers share the advocacy function with other professionals,                   paraprofessionals, and laypersons.  Recent research has raised                  questions about the wisdom of granting lawyers exclusive rights to              deliver services such as advocacy.  However, there has been no                  systematic research that has compared the work and performance of               lawyer and nonlawyer advocates in contexts where both are permitted             to appear.                                                                                                                                                      Using a \"taxonomic theory of representation\" as a conceptual                    framework, this study compares different types of advocates in four             settings, using a combination of observation, structured                        interviews, and semi-structured interviews.  The focus is on \"case              advocacy,\" as distinguished from \"policy advocacy,\" involving both              adversary and nonadversary (inquisitorial) processes.  The study                will evaluate the effectiveness of lawyers and non-lawyers, isolate             the factors that determine the variable effectiveness of each type              of advocate, and potentially demonstrate the advantages of getting              away from the simple dichotomy of lawyers versus nonlawyers.                    Focusing on the question of the effectiveness of representation                 will not only advance theory in this area but will allow                        consideration of some of the foundational arguments that are used               to justify the existence of the legal profession's monopoly on                  advocacy representation.",
