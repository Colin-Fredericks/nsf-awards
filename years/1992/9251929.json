 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate students at the Chemical Engineering Department                   of Clarkson University experiment with microcontamination                       control, particularly as it applies to gas filtration.                          Students work with particle size distributions and statistical                  data analysis, measuring and controlling particles smaller than                 one micrometer.  The techniques and nomenclature learned in                     this experiment aid students in such broad fields as pollution                  control and industrial hygiene, and also give them specific                     insight into the concerns of the microelectronics industry.                     The major cause of low manufacturing yields in microelectronics                 production is the device failures produced by                                   microcontamination.  As devices with smaller critical                           dimensions are produced the problems posed by submicron                         particle contamination will increase.  The new equipment in                     this laboratory experiment includes a laser light scattering                    particle counter, a condensation nucleus counter, a laminar air                 flow clean hood, ultraclean stainless steel tubing, valves,                     regulators, and filter housings, and a computer for data                        logging.",
