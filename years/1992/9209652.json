 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a 1992 RIA Award.  It is proposed to                                    develop a new concept for fabricating hetero-                                   interface systems using van der Waals surfaces                                  of layered metal chalcogenide materials.  This                                  will be studied experimentally by growing                                       different kinds of layered metal chalcogenides                                  on top of each other by means of molecular                                      beam epitaxy, a process that has been referred                                  to as \"van der Waals epitaxy\".  Of particular                                   interest of this method is the ability to                                       fabricate atomically and electronically abrupt                                  hetero-interfaces without regard to their lattice                               matching requirement.  The epitaxial                                            conditions will be investigated in detail for                                   improving the quality of the thin films, and                                    the fundamental nucleation and growth of the                                    epitaxial layers will be investigated.  Due to                                  the sensitivity of the layer stacking sequence                                  to the properties of transition metal                                           dichalcogenides, we will develop a technique                                    to determine the \"polytpism\" of the growing                                     thin film using Reflection High Energy                                          Electron Diffraction oscillations.  The unique                                  nature of the hetero-interfaces fabricated by                                   this method will allow the investigation of the                                 fundamental aspects related to the electron                                     transfer between metals and semiconductors,                                     from which rational design of Schottky device                                   structure will be explored.  Finally the growth                                 of selected semiconducting layered metal                                        chalcogenide on GaAs will be investigated in                                    a view toward the development of newer                                          material systems.  The potential flexibility for                                constructing complex layered heterostructures                                   containing different materials selected for their                               specific material properties will constitute a                                  substantial breakthrough in heteroepitaxy                                       technology.",
