 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the historical role of law in the formation             of peoples' political and social identities (e.g., citizens of a                given nation-state; members of an ethnic group) in a multi-ethnic               society, particularly Sri Lanka.  It posits that such identities                cannot be taken for granted.  Rather, they are constructed in the               course of a historical process and in that process, law and legal               systems play a part.  Also, the project focuses on how law, as a                crucial force in shaping identities, influences ethnic conflict in              this multi-ethnic state.                                                                                                                                        Drawing on archival records related to customary law and the                    complexity of legal systems experienced by the people of Sri Lanka,             the study provides a unique historical perspective of the                       combination of local and transnational forces triggering ethnic                 conflict in this nation-state.  Further, this historical analysis               provides the basis for introducing a general theoretical                        perspective for advancing understanding ethnic conflict, focusing               on the indirect role played by changing legal orders.  Finally,                 the study shows that the influence of global sociolegal phenomena               on nation building has historical antecedents and therefore, is not             unique to contemporary events in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.",
