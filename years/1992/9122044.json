 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is the aim of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research to                   fabricate optical nanofibers and explore their use for optical                  sensing and imaging of surfaces.  The fibers are employed in two                environmental modes: (1) the tips of cleaved nanofibers are coated              with metal films for examining their interaction with aggressive                environments through detection by internal reflectometry within the             fiber; (2) spectroscopy measurements are carried out with uncoated              fiber tips to sample small volumes of gases and liquids near                    reactive surfaces.  In the first mode, the optical fibers are used              to conduct experiments inside an environmental scanning electron                microscope chamber in order to obtain concurrent surface morphology             and corrosion reaction rate measurements in a controlled atmosphere             (to 20 torr pressure).  In the second mode of operation, the                    spectroscopic detection of species near reactive surfaces is sensed             in volumes whose size is dependent on the diameter of the fiber and             the wavelength of light.  Reactive surfaces themselves will be                  imaged to detect submicron heterogeneities and defects.                         %%%                                                                             This research has the potential to open new fields for optical                  sensing and high resolution imaging.  It may be possible as a                   result to follow surface chemical interactions in difficult                     environments in situ in real time.",
