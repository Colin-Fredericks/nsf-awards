 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide for one-half the funds necessary to                acquire an isotope-ratio-monitoring gas chromatography mass                     spectrometer. The University of Hawaii has committed the additional             funding required for this acquisition. This instrumentation will                be used in a variety of geologic and oceanographic research                     programs in the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology,               University of Hawaii. Present need for this instrumentation is                  great and will be even greater in the future. Current research                  requires the ability to analyze carbon, oxygen,nitrogen,sulfur, and             hydrogen isotopic compositions of samples and on-line carbon                    isotopic compositions of individual organic compounds. Equipment                presently at Hawaii cannot now,nor in the future be up-dated to                 meet their current research needs. The acquisition of this mass                 spectrometry system will provide them with the capabilities to meet             current demands as well as give them the flexibility to add new                 technologies in the future.",
