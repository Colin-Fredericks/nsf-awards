Children are                       hypothesized to accumulate a set of preferred math strategies                   based on perceived social acceptability of the strategies, their                attributions about the role of effort in learning, and                          metacognitive knowledge.  Children who believe that effort in                   learning increases ability, as opposed to children who believe                  that ability is stable, are believed to develop more                            metacognitive knowledge about strategies and to use strategies                  that result in good performance.  Children who believe ability to               be stable and indicative of intelligence are expected to be more                influenced in their use of math strategies by teachers',                        parents', and peers' attitudes toward strategies.  The                          development of strategies and mathematical performance across a                 single school year will be examined as a function of perceived                  social attitudes toward strategies, strategy training in the                    school and home, attributional beliefs, and metacognitive                       factors.  Of special interest will be the shift from external                   strategies (e.g., fingers) to internal strategies (e.g., mental                 calculation) since much of children's early strategy use is                     external and therefore open to the effects of social comment on                 the desirability of such strategies.",
