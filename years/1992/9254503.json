 "awd_abstract_narration": "The AAAS's Project on Science Technology and Disability has                     developed and published four concise brochures as a series                      to serve as comprehensive accessibility guides for research                     directors, meeting conveners, department heads, and                             professors so that all aspects of their programs will be                        accessible to scientists, engineers, and students with                          disabilities.  The series includes the following:                               Barrier-Free:  Workshops and Conferences for Scientists and                     Engineers, Barrier-Free:  Laboratories and Classrooms in                        Science and Engineering, Barrier-Free:  Access to Science                       Literacy, and Barrier-Free:  Access in Word and Deed.                                                                                                           The existence of the series has been widely publicized and                      requests have exceeded expectations.  The original plan was                     to have the series available at AAAS and other scientific                       meetings but the AAAS has received requests for the series                      by mail daily.  They are no longer able to honor the requests                   without some financial support.  This project will provide                      funds for postage and secretarial assistance.                                                                                                                   The passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act has made                     the dissemination of the Barrier-Free series timely.  This                      project will aid in efforts to remove barriers which have,                      in the past, prevented scientists and students with                             disabilities to fully participate in scientific research and                    studies.",
