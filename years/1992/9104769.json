 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is focused on the functional role of a newly-                  discovered cytosolic protein kinase that is involved in the                     regulation of cell proliferation. The kinase phosphorylates its                 substrate proteins at serine or threonine residues that reside in               positions adjacent to a proline residue. Because of this                        specificity, the kinase is designated as a proline-directed protein             kinase (PDPK) by the PI. The active enzyme consists of a complex                of two subunits, namely the catalytic p34cdc2 kinase and a                      regulatory A-type cyclin. The kinase is thought to function at the              G1/S transition of the cell cycle in somatic mammalian cells and                to phosphorylate a number of potentially-important substrates,                  including growth factor receptors and key regulatory enzymes. The               activation of these substrates by phosphorylation may be an                     important facet of mitotic induction by growth factors and                      mitogens. The link between the activity of this kinase and the                  induction of proliferation by the treatment of cells with mitogenic             growth factors will be explored in a series of biochemical,                     pharmacological and immunological studies that focus on the role                played by the kinase in this process.                                                                                                                           The regulation of progression through the cell cycle and the                    induction of cell proliferation are areas of intense research that              have merged because of the discovery of several key factors that                are essential for both processes. Most prominent among these                    regulatory factors is a protein kinase known as p34cdc2 that is                 present in all organisms from yeast to humans, and, as part of a                complex with certain regulatory subunits known as the cyclins,                  functions at particular times during the cell cycle to promote                  progression through mitosis. Studies on the cyclin proteins,                    performed largely in invertebrate embryonic cells, have                         demonstrated that the cyclins confer specific activity and                      substrate specificity to the kinase, but in these cells, the role               of the A-type cyclins has remained less clear than that for B-type              cyclins. Dr. Hall has shown that the binding of cyclin-A to p34cdc2             confers a particular type of activity for the kinase in somatic                 mammalian cells. This activity appears to be essential for                      progression of another part of the cell cycle, when the cell begins             its DNA replication stage, long before mitosis. Dr. Hall has                    demonstrated that cyclin-A binding confers unique substrate                     specificity to p34cdc2 that could prove to be a major breakthrough              in our understanding of how somatic cells enter the mitotic pathway             prior to DNA synthesis.",
