 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will research some basic and important areas                  in cryptography and theoretical computer science that have                      significant interaction with combinatorics, in particular,                      secrecy and authentication codes, secret-sharing schemes and                    universal hashing.  Informally, a secrecy code is used in                       order to keep the contents of message secret, while an                          authentication code is used to ensure the \"integrity\" of a                      message, i.e. that the message has not been tampered with.                      Threshold schemes and secret-sharing schemes were introduced                    to handle problems such as key distribution and shared control                  of jointly initiated events.  Universal hashing is a technique                  to ensure good average-case behaviour of hash function, and                     has applications in diverse areas of theoretical computer                       science, including cryptography.                                                     New constructions and algorithms will be investigated for                  these types of cryptographic protocols.  The problems to be                     researched include:  construction of optimal codes for                          authentication and secrecy and construction of codes which                      permit arbitration; construction of secret-sharing schemes for                  general access structures and efficient implementations of                      these codes; and constructions and bounds for universal                         classes of hash function.  All of these questions involve                       combinatorial designs in a fundamental way, both in                             constructions and in characterizations.",
