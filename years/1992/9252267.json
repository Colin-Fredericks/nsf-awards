The instruments are                    allowing students to perform data collection, processing and                    interpretation in a variety of geological environments                          including groundwater location and contamination studies.                       Their results are being integrated with other types of                          geophysical (gravity, magnetics, resistivity) data and                          geological data to obtain a better understanding of the                         strengths and weaknesses of the techniques.  Along with the                     department's electrical resistivity and gravity meter, the                      electromagnetic surveying equipment is providing students with                  the opportunity to experiment with the major geophyiscal                        methods used in groundwater and environmental studies.",
