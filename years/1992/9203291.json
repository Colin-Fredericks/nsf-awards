 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many brain processes operate in parallel on sensory input to draw               distinctions (boundaries, gradations, modulations, etc.) in the                 fabric of perceptual space/time.  For instance, there are visual                processes that operate on the spatiotemporal variations in light                intensity to generate brightness distinctions.  Other processes                 operate on variations in the spectral content of light over space               and time to construct color distinctions.  Still other processes                draw distinctions based on spatiotemporal variations in textural                properties (e.g., texture contrast, granularity and/or                          orientation).  It is this last class of distinction-drawing                     processes, or channels, that these experiments will investigate.                                                                                                Histogram contrast analysis is a new branch of measurement theory               whose purpose is to (i) isolate individual perceptual channels, and             (ii) precisely characterize the computations those channels                     perform.  No one knows exactly how many distinct channels are                   devoted to drawing texture-based perceptual distinctions, though                there is general agreement that multiple channels are involved.                 Nor is there any data to indicate what specific computations are                performed by any one of the putative channels used in texture                   perception.  Heretofore, models of texture perception have relied               on arbitrary, ad hoc guesses as to the nature of the channels used              in drawing textural distinctions.                                                                                                                               These experiments will use histogram contrast analysis (i) to                   isolate individual channels used in drawing textural distinctions               and (ii) to determine their computational characteristics.  These               experiments will thus make a start at the task of constructing a                table of the computational \"elements of texture perception\"                     analogous to the periodic table of physical elements.  Any theory               of texture perception precise and comprehensive enough to predict               performance probabilities on actual texture discrimination tasks                must have such a table of elements as its cornerstone.",
