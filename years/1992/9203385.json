A lesson from the                                                Loma Prieta earthquake is that a                                                wider group of local government                                                 agencies need to be involved not                                                only in mitigation, but also in                                                 recovery and reconstruction.                                                                                                                                    This project investigates how                                                   improved collaboration between local                                            emergency management agencies and                                               planning departments may produce                                                economies of expertise that result                                              in a more comprehensive effort in                                               all phases of hazards management.                                               Planning departments are a                                                      significant source of poorly tapped                                             local resources to support that                                                 objective.  Theory suggests that                                                specific forms of communication and                                             cooperation between the agencies can                                            promote more effective effort under                                             different environmental and                                                     organizational conditions.
