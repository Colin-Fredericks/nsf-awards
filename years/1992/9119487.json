 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Fred Wendorf and                  his international team of collaborators will conduct                            archaeological research in the Gebel Nabta region of the Eastern                Sahara Desert in Egypt.  They will return to sites located in                   past work and employ a series of strategies which include survey,               surface collection of exposed materials and careful excavation.                 This site dates from the Neolithic period, ca. 9,000 to 6,0000                  years before the present.  A series of houses are particularly                  important because they contain large numbers of small                           depressions, probably the remains of cooking fires.  Each holds                 abundant and well preserved floral remains which possibly are the               by products of individual cooking events.  With such data it is                 possible to gain unprecedented insight into subsistence practices               since it is extremely rare for plant materials to be so well                    preserved.  A broad scale site survey should provide information                on settlement pattern and subsistence strategies.                                                                                                               The Neolithic period marked the appearance of many of the                       hallmarks which characterize our society today.  The first long                 term settlements were established, pottery first appears in the                 archaeological record, and plants and animals were domesticated.                Because this change was so important, archaeologists refer to it                as \"The Neolithic Revolution.\"  However, it is not well                         understood what caused groups in many parts of the world to                     change from a hunting and gathering way of life to a more                       sedentary existence.  Dr. Wendorf's work focusses directly on                   this issue and the Egyptian desert provides an excellent region                 for this study because sites are often visible from surface                     remains and the dry climate favors floral preservation.                                                                                                         This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data of interest to a large number of archaeologists.  It will                  explore indirectly the issue of black Africa and its contribution               to the development of civilization.  It will also shed light on                 the processes which led to the emergence of complex societies.",
