 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the number of species facing extinction in the wild continues                to increase, the role of captive breeding programs in preserving                biotic diversity will become more important.  Decisions regarding               management of captive populations can have large impacts on their               genetic diversity and may ultimately affect the survival of                     threatened species.  The influence of captive breeding strategies               on the viability of individuals and populations will be assessed                in two related experiments.  First, small populations of the                    mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) will be managed using one of four               strategies that have been suggested for the management of captive               populations.  This experiment will determine how these strategies               affect the reproduction, growth, development and survival of                    individuals in captivity.  Second, individuals from these                       populations will be used to found populations in large microcosms,              designed to simulate small ponds.  This experiment will determine               if the way a captive population is managed will affect its ability              to establish successful wild populations.  The influence of captive             breeding strategies on the number of individuals that need to be                released to establish successful wild populations will also be                  examined.  This research will help improve management of captive                breeding populations, while also helping to ensure the success of               reintroduction programs.",
