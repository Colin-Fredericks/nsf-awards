 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetic variation within populations is ultimately the                     source of all evolutionary change.  Allozyme data were for the                  most part insufficient for determining the relative importance of               mutation, genetic drift, recombination, and natural selection in                determining the distribution of genetic variation in nature.  DNA               data are qualitatively different in that they provide a history                 of genetic variation in natural populations, thereby allowing one               to make inferences regarding the type of selection acting on a                  locus (i.e., purifying, directional, balancing) and the variants                within a locus which are a target of selection.  The work                       outlined in this proposal is an attempt to understand patterns of               selection over the distal half of the X chromosome in Drosophila                malanogaster and Drosophila simulans.  Previous data suggest the                allozyme polymorphism at phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (pgd) is                a target of selection in D. manlanogaster.  It is proposed to                   build on these data with a molecular analysis of population                     variation at pgd.  The molecular data will allow determination of               the influence of selection and recombination on the distribution                of variation at this locus and localize specific variants on                    which selection acts.  This X-linked gene is located near the                   telomere, a region known to have low recombination rates.                       Theoretical results and preliminary data suggest that a                         significant fraction of DNA variation in the region could be                    influenced by genetic \"hitchhiking\" associated with the fixation                of advantageous mutants.  Thus, pgd may have had a complex                      history, with variation influenced by local and regional                        phenomena.  Therefore, in addition to detailed study of pgd, DNA                variation at several gene regions on either side of pgd  will be                measured in order to place the pgd data in a large context and                  determine the impact of selective substitutions on DNA variation                over the distal portion of the X chromosome.",
