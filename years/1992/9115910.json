 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hermaphroditism is poorly understood in sessile marine Bryozoa                  that release of sperm externally for fertilization and                          reproduction.  This project is designed to explore in a marine                  bryozoan how male reproductive success is related to male                       reproductive effort, and ultimately to the evolution of                         hermaphroditism.  The hermaphroditic marine bryozoan                            Celleporella hyalina displays extensive variation in the                        expression of male and female gender in populations studied                     along the mid-coast of Maine.  Individual colonies vary                         quantitatively in the allocation of anatomical structures to                    male relative to female reproductive functions.  This                           investigation will use this polymorphism to test theoretical                    mechanisms for evolutionary maintenance of hermaphroditism.                     The study will address three specific objectives: (1) to                        develop genetic markers in the bryozoan that can be used in                     paternity analysis, (2) to determine whether gender variation                   has any measurable reproductive success, and (3) to use                         naturally-occurring \"female\" variants of the bryozoan in                        independent assays for fertilization success.  This study will                  represent the first attempt to test sex allocation models for                   the presence of simultaneous hermaphroditism in benthic marine                  animals.  Although this study will not isolate the mechanism of                 combined gender in bryozoans, it will provide an evaluation of                  the validity of this mechanism, a poorly understood aspect of                   benthic invertebrate reproductive ecology.",
