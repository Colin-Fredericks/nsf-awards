 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to visually recognize complex objects is dependent upon             structures within the central nervous system which are responsible              for perceiving the objects and for processing the information                   received. One important type of visual recognition which is                     critical for any species is the ability of individuals of that                  species to distinguish members of different species from those of               their own  species, or conspecifics; this type of discrimination                is important to recognize potential predators as well as potential              mates. In this award to Dr. Toru Shimizu, visual recognition will               be studied in two avian species. Anatomical connections between                 various parts of the higher visual areas of the central nervous                 system will be studied using tracer techniques. Discrimination                  based on differentiating between members of the same or different               species, and between the two genders will be studied with the use               of video images. The importance of different regions of the higher              visual areas of the brain will be determined by studying the                    effects of selective ablation on performance in the discrimination              paradigm. This research contributes knowledge about how the brain               recognizes complex visual objects and how this visual information               is processed to obtain meaningful responses.",
