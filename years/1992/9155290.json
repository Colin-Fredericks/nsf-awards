 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the proposed project, approximately 555,000 youth and                   adults will improve their knowledge of the basic sciences and                   mathematics, and learn to integrate and apply these disciplines,                by analyzing local environmental problems using remote sensing                  imagery and maps.  Faculty from the Cornell laboratory for                      Environmental Applications of Remote Sensing (CLEARS) and                       Cornell Department of Natural Resources will train county teams                 of teachers, museum and nature center educators, community                      leaders, and Cooperative Extension agents from throughout New                   York State to conduct educational programs with youth and adults                in their communities.  Previously developed CLEARS educator                     enrichment workshops and training materials will be enhanced and                revised based on the interactions among Cornell Faculty,                        informal and formal science educators, and students during this                 program.  A facultative evaluation focusing on the workshops,                   training materials, and educator teaching skills, and a                         summative evaluation focusing on student learning and attitudes,                program delivery in the various community education settings,                   and the effectiveness of the county educator teams will be                      conducted.  The results of the evaluation will be incorporated                  into a program handbook and used in nationwide dissemination of                 the program.",
