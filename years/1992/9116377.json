 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       catalytic antibody work of Professor Kim Janda at Scripps                       Clinic.  Specifically tailored antibody catalysts for the                       synthesis of organic and biological molecules will be made and                  studied.  Antibodies which will survive in water                                miscible/immiscible solutions will be made and examined.                        Haptens will be synthesized which are designed to elicit                        antibodies which can catalyze peptide bond formation and the                    catalytic properties of the resulting antibodies will be                        studied.  The use of antibodies to catalyze ring forming                        reactions will also be explored.                                                %%%                                                                             The ability of antibodies to increase the rate of organic and                   biological transformations will be examined.  The immune system                 of mice will be induced to produce these antibodies by                          injection of molecules which correspond in structure to the                     highest energy point between the starting materials and                         products of these transformations.  These studies are important                 since they will provide proteins designed to catalyze                           specific reactions for which no natural enzymes are available.",
