 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most important group of organisms able to control potential                 insect pest populations are parasitic wasps that parasitize the                 eggs, larvae, or pupae of their host.  These parasitic wasps are                the mainstay of classical biological control which has enormous                 potential to impact agriculture and reduce the use of pesticides                worldwide.  Parasitic wasps have a vast array of life histories and             a unique ability to control the sex ratio of their progeny.  Sex                ratio biasing has a critical impact on the demography of wasp                   populations and their ability to compare with other wasp species                and regulate host populations.  This study involves developing a                model of a parasitic wasp Diadegma insulare on diamondback moth                 which is a pest in cruciferous crops (cabbage, cauliflower,etc.)                world wide. The study focuses on the influence of the quality of                plants on the quality of diamondback moth larvae and how the                    quality of these larvae influences the demography of Diadegma,                  especially in terms of sex ratio biasing.  The challenge of the                 study is to obtain a realistic model that integrates genetic and                environmental components associated with sex ratio biasing in a 3-              trophic level ecological interaction, and to use the model to help              interpret data obtained from field and laboratory experiments.  The             knowledge gained could help in promoting biological control of                  diamondback moth.//",
