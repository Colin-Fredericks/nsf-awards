 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth in international trade, advances in communication and                technology, ease of travel, and changes in immigration patterns                 make it more likely that disputes will arise between individuals                of different national, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds.  In recent             years, sociolegal scholars have begun to investigate how cultural               variation in preferences for dispute resolution procedures is                   related to individual psychological processes.  This study will                 extend this work by examining how procedural preferences are shaped             by a person's culture of origin, acculturation to new social forms,             gender, social status, and economic resources.                                                                                                                  This comparative study conducted in the United States, Germany, and             Hong Kong systematically analyzes patterns of procedural                        preferences, attitudes toward various forms of regulation, and                  dispute-related beliefs and behaviors.  These three sites have been             the target of substantial migration.  Two experimental studies will             be conducted, involving approximately 500 participants at each                  site, to test whether differences in preferences for types of                   dispute resolution reflect differences in values or differences in              beliefs about the effective or appropriate means to reach their                 goals.  One study will focus on preferences about options available             for dealing with disputes (such as ignoring the conflict, ignoring              the disputant, or direct negotiation).  The second will consider                the means available to resolve the conflict (such as mediation or               adversarial adjudication).                                                                                                                                      The project will contribute to our understanding of transnational               issues by advancing our knowledge of how culture, ethnicity,                    recency of migration, and other social factors interact to shape                individuals' legal attitudes and reactions to a variety of laws,                disputing fora, and disputing options.  From a global perspective,              the results will have major significance for increasing our                     knowledge of what drives preferences for one form of law or                     regulatory regime over another and of why people of diverse                     cultural origins differ in their views about what constitutes a                 fair procedure or law.",
