 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators will conduct research in various               aspects of dynamical systems. The investigators will concentrate                primarily on low dimensional systems. In particular they will                   study attractors for unimodal maps of the interval, determination               of asymptotic properties of the renormalization operator, and the               problem of topological exponential maps. They will also consider                iterations of homeomorphisms of the annulus and the dynamics of                 flows on three manifolds.                                                            This award will support research in the general area of                    dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to                   understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear,                 and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study               of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can                 best be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid                  flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical                     systems, and chemical reactions.",
