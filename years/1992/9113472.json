 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                 the Chemistry Division, Professor Kollman will develop a new                    approach to the construction of intermolecular potentials for                   use in molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulation of                 biomolecules.  He will focus on two issues: first, the addition                 of non-additive non-bonded energy terms to the standard                         intermolecular potential which will have an important impact on                 the ability to simulate structures and energies realistically                   for the widest range of molecules and, secondly, a general                      analysis of the functional forms and parameters in such                         potentials.  The non-additive effects will be built into the                    potential by explicitly incorporating polarization effects into                 the force field.  Professor Kollman has developed a new model                   which can represent liquid water better than other non-additive                 models and leads to an excellent reproduction of the properties                 of dilute ionic solutions.  He will extend this model to other                  simple solvents and solutes in order to validate it as a                        general method for studying molecular liquids and solutions by                  computer based approaches.  The model will be tested against                    solutions of simple ions, salts, and small organic molecules as                 well as organic macrocycles/ionophores.                                         %%%                                                                             The ability to simulate the interactions of biomolecules by                     means of molecular mechanics and dynamics will lead to a better                 understanding of elementary biological processes in such areas                  as drug design and electron transport.  The intermolecular                      potentials developed by Professor Kollman are a key component                   of these simulations.",
