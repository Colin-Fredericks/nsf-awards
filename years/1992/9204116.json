 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for the continued collection and                 analysis of multi-instrument data at the Longyearbyen, Svalbard                 Observatory.  Instrumented with an all-sky camera, a meridian                   scanning photometer, riometer, induction and fluxgate                           magnetometers, this site is well suited for studies of the cusp                 and delineation of high latitude magnetospheric boundaries.  The                Longyearbyen observatory is unique in the northern hemisphere in                lying on the dark side of the terminator at noon during northern                winter.  The sky is dark enough to allow optical observation from               late October to early February.  The site has been operated                     successfully for more than a decade.  Studies of the multi                      instrument data helps provide a context for interpretation                      unavailable for single instrument measurements.  While the                      magnetometers can be used to identify the station location with                 regard to the major high-latitude current systems, the optical                  instruments identify emissions associated with the various                      regions near the cusp. As yet, it is not clear what processes the               emissions and associated geomagnetic pulsations represent; they                 may map boundaries or show the processes confined by                            magnetospheric boundaries.  The larger question is the goal of                  this proposal.  During this winter season, this campaign will                   allow us to study large scale features of the cusp region and                   their development in time.  Associated with impulsive events at                 the magnetopause, arcs and waves are detected which require study               before a positive identification can be made.  When combined with               satellite data, the data suite is sufficient to begin the process               of identifying ionospheric signatures of auroral forms associated               the the cusp.",
