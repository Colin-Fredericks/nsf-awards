 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is proposed to investigate the intracellular signal               transduction pathways that regulate the synthesis of defensive                  proteinase inhibitor proteins in plant leaves in response to                    herbivore and pathogen attacks. Our previous research has provided              strong evidence that the inducible signalling pathways that                     regulate two proteinase inhibitor genes in tomato, potato, and                  alfalfa plants, and likely in other plants as well, involve a                   lipid-based system that results in the production of jasmonic acid              as a key signalling molecule. The evidence suggests that insect or              pathogen attacks produce extracellular signals that interact with               the plant cell membrane to release linolenic acid. Linolenic acid               is known to be converted to jasmonic acid through several                       biochemical steps. Both linolenic acid and jasmonic acid are                    powerful inducers of the inhibitor genes when placed on leaf                    surfaces, indicating their involvement in the signalling pathway.               The research funded by this grant will seek the mechanism within                the plant membranes that releases linolenic acid  in response to                signals produced by insect or pathogen attacks and will establish               the biochemical  events leading to the synthesis of jasmonic acid.              The mechanism by which jasmonic acid can activate proteinase                    inhibitor gene expression in the plant cell nucleus will also be                studied. The fate of jasmonic acid and its receptor will be sought,             and its role in gene activation will be investigated. The                       information will be utilized to understand the biochemical basis                of inducible plant defenses against insects and pathogens.",
