 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, from the California State University                        Chancellor's Office and the University of Pittsburgh, seeks to                  establish a grant program for underwriting participation by                     community colleges in the 1992 Chautauqua Teleconference Course,                Increasing Minority Participation in Math-Based Disciplines.                         The course will be given by Uri Triesman, Department of                    Mathematics, University of Texas, Austin and the Dana Center for                Mathematics Education, U.C. Berkeley.  Increasing Minority                      Participation In Math-Based Disciplines will be produced by                     University Extension Services, California State University, Long                Beach and will be distributed live, by direct satellite                         transmission to reception sites across the country.                                  Emerging Scholars Programs have had a dramatic effect on the               performance and retention of underrepresented minority students in              freshman calculus courses.  The program encourages a team approach.             Using satellite technology to distribute the program live allows                for participation by man instructors and administrators at one                  site, at a cost much lower than would be incurred if the                        participants and Course Directors traveled to regional sites.                   Satellite distribution also allows greater numbers to participate               in the course to learn about and implement strategies for                       incorporating the successful Emerging Scholars Programs at their                home institutions.//",
