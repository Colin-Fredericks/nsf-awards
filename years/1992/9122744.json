Her                       background and expertise is in the MBE growth of such materials and             structures.  The requested RPG will provide the PI with the support             needed to gather and review additional literature, carefully                    formulate materials calculations needed for design and growth of                double barrier resonant tunneling structures appropriate to the                 line of research she intends to follow, to establish direct                     contacts with active researchers in this field, and to further                  collaborations in progress.                                                     %%%                                                                             Research in this field is oriented toward the examination of hot                electron and phonon-assisted tunneling effects under double barrier             resonant tunneling conditions associated with quantum confinement               structures fabricated in thin layers of semiconductors.  The                    research forms the basis for advanced electronic and photonic                   devices having potential performance beyond conventional device                 structures and configurations.",
