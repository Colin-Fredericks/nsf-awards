The                        participants include representatives from academia, industry,                   consulting organizations and providers of health care delivery.                 Special efforts have been made to engage users, be they consumers,              professionals or physicians.                                                         The workshop addresses the challenges created by the impact                of devices and materials on living systems in the engineering                   design process.  The effective transfer of general design theory                and methodology concepts to the domain of biomedical engineering                is another motivation for this activity.  The ultimate goal is the              development of a research agenda that will more fully incorporate               issues of safety, process control and efficacy assessment in the                life cycle design, manufacturing and deployment of biomedical                   engineering products.",
