 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will complete the first (two year) phase of                        establishing a hands-on telecommunications laboratory,                          supporting undergraduate instruction in Information Systems,                    Computer Networks, Computer Architecture and Networking                         Software.  It is a joint interdisciplinary project including                    Computer Information Systems (CIS) in the School of Business                    and Computer Science (CS) in the School of Science.  Data                       communications laboratory courses from both disciplines are                     presently being offered using the equipment on hand.  The                       current courses are designed to teach the basics of data                        communications, including transmission media, LAN                               configurations, operation, management and diagnosis.  However,                  the current laboratory does not include network analysis nor                    fiber optic equipment.  These limitations severely restrict the                 scope of the possible experiences.  The equipment to be                         purchased under this project will allow students to carry out                   a full complement of experiments.  The goal is to provide                       students with direct, hands-on experience in designing,                         assembling, testing, modifying and diagnosing                                   telecommunications networks.  Over a five year period it is                     planned to expand from data communications to a laboratory                      which will support experiments in the high speed transmission                   and switching of multiform information, including data, images,                 voice and video.",
