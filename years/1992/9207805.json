 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is a field study designed to quantify                     previously undetermined base cation cycling and weathering rates in             a high-elevation coniferous forest in the Adirondack Mountains, NY.             A new and unexplored transfer-reaction approach to the use of                   strontium isotope tracers will be integrated with more traditional              chemical and ecosystem mass balance methods to obtain direct                    measurements of previously unquantified base cations fluxes, such as            release from mineral weathering, removal from cation exchange sites             and biocycling.  The field site is on Whiteface Mountain, where the             PI's has been studying nutrient cycling for over six years.                     Whiteface is a unique location for cation cycling and mineral                   weathering studies because the site has a pair of research                      watersheds underlain by granitoid bedrock of highly contrasting                 87Sr/86Sr value.  The proposed project will allow the PI's to                   quantify the influence of various ecosystem processes - such as                 atmospheric deposition, organic matter decomposition, cation                    exchange, and mineral weathering - on soil solution and stream                  chemistry and on the long-term contribution to total ecosystem                  inventories.  Comparison of present and long-term contributions of              these processes to cation cycling will provide insight into the                 mechanisms and magnitude of ecosystem response to environmental                 change.",
