 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                        metallic Chemistry Program, will explore the redox properties                   of metal clusters, and the volumes of activation of intra-                      molecular cluster processes.  Cluster compounds to be studied                   in the first area will contain carbon atoms as part of the core                 structure.  Substituents on these carbon atoms will have                        pi-donor/acceptor properties that will serve to delocalize the                  unpaired electron density arising from electron transfer                        processes.  This is expected to stabilize the redox products                    such that they can be characterized by conventional spectro-                    scopic techniques.  In the second area, volumes of activation                   for intramolecular processes will be studied for several series                 of compounds, whose reactivity has already been studied by                      other methods, to see if this parameter can be used as a                        reliable measure of the nature of the transition state.  This                   is particularly important for reactions that are first order in                 cluster where it is presently nearly impossible to determine                    whether metal-metal bond cleavage, bridge to terminal ligand                    conversion, etc. is involved in achieving the transition state                  for the reaction.  The ultimate objective of these investi-                     gations is to determine the ways in which the properties of                     ligated metal clusters differ from those of small uncomplexed                   aggregates of metal atoms and to be able to selectively modify                  these properties by changing the number of atoms in the cluster                 and the nature of the ligating groups.                                          %%%                                                                             This project is aimed at understanding the fundamental                          chemistry of organometallic compounds that are composed of                      small numbers of metal atoms that are bonded together (in a                     cluster) and are surrounded by donor ligands.  In some ways the                 chemistry of these compounds models that of catalytic reactions                 of molecules on the surfaces of small metal particles that are                  routinely used in industrial processes.",
