 "awd_abstract_narration": "Essential laminations are a recently defined generalization of             both the incompressible surface and the codimension-one foliation               without Reeb components of a compact 3-manifold.  Both of these                 more classical objects have proved remarkably useful in obtaining               geometric/topological information about 3-manifolds from                        homotopy-theoretic data, and the essential lamination has already               begun to show itself to be a worthy successor to both of its                    `parents.'  The investigator intends to use essential laminations               to study the extent to which the fundamental group of a 3-manifold              determines the manifold up to homeomorphism, and also to study the              question of whether or not the manifold admits a hyperbolic                     structure.  He further intends to use the existence of normal forms             for essential laminations to study the question of whether or not               a 3-manifold (principally a hyperbolic 3-manifold) contains an                  essential lamination.                                                                It is a surprising fact that although we live in a three                   dimensional space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so are blessed with              a natural intuition about such geometric objects, in the end this               does not carry us as far as we might have expected, for questions               which have been settled by algebraic calculations for higher                    dimensional manifolds still remain baffling in the 3-dimensional                case.  The most famous of these is the celebrated conjecture of                 Poincare from around the turn of the century concerning 3-                      dimensional spheres, where precisely the original 3-dimensional                 case is the only one still open.  The investigator is pursuing a                variety of questions about 3-dimensional manifolds, some with                   slightly strange notions of distance on them, so-called hyperbolic              metrics, but time and time again these questions have been shown to             have clear relevance to the case of manifolds with a more familiar              notion of distance.",
