 "awd_abstract_narration": "The II-VI semiconductors feature bandgaps ranging from the                      ultraviolet to the far infrared, creating the potential to                      form the basis of a wide variety of electronic and                              optoelectronic devices.  II-VI semiconductors are not as                        developed as their III-V counterparts, primarily because of                     difficulties encountered in understanding and controlling                       defects arising during growth.  This proposal is for                            acquisition of equipment to address the common problem of                       defects in wide bandgap II-VI semiconductors.  To address                       this problem, we propose to (1) build a custom Molecular                        Beam Enitaxy system with in-situ instrumentation to                             investigate growth kinetics; (2) assemble a high resolution                     optical spectroscopy system for low temperature                                 photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy using a double                         monochromator and tunable laser system; and (3) assemble an                     optically detected magnetic resonance system which allows                       magnetic resonance identification of point defects in                           semiconductors.  The magnetic resonance experiments will                        involve use of the double monochromator and tunable laser                       system, in addition to a 4 Tesla magnet dewar with optical                      access and associated microwave bridge.  Acquisition of the                     proposed equipment allows original research to improve the                      understanding of the optical, electrical, magnetic, and                         defect properties of these difficult materials.  In                             particular, special emphasis will be placed on                                  understanding the relationship between growth mechanisms                        and defect formation in these materials, thus leading to                        both improvement and better control of basic properties.                        This equipment will immediately contribute to the research                      programs of the three principal investigators.  The planned                     research efforts will involve two postdoctoral scientists                       and six or more graduate students.  It has always been the                      practice of investigators to include undergraduates, thus                       it is anticipated that this equipment will also influence                       the career of two to three undergraduates each year.",
