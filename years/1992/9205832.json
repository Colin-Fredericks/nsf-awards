 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biosynthesis of (1,3)-B-linked glucan in higher plants is                   catalyzed by the plasma membrane-bound enzyme callose synthase                  (UDP-Glc: (1,3)-B-glucan synthase).  Callose synthase activity is               ubiquitous in isolated membrane fractions from a wide variety of                plants, and has been hypothesized to be a deregulated form of                   cellulose synthase.  Therefore, to understand the biochemical basis             for the regulation of cell wall polysaccharide biogenesis and wound             healing, it is necesary to identify and characterize the                        polypeptide subunits of polysaccharide synthases such as calloses               synthase, and the genes which encode them.                                      Although callose synthase has proven to be a stubborn enzyme to                 purify to homogeneity by standard protein fractionation techniques,             rapid progress has been made towards identifying the polypeptide                components of callose synthases from various sources.  Comparisons              of polypeptide profiles between our system, Beta vulgaris L., and               other plants show the emergence of common polypeptide profiles.                 During the previous two years, through photoaffinity labeling,                  improved enrichment procedures and most recently polypeptide                    depletion, we have identified UDP-Glc-binding subunits of 57-,31-               and 29-kD, as well as a group of instrinsic hydrophobic                         polypeptides of 92, 83, 43 and 27 kD.  Our working hypothesis, upon             which the proposed experiments are predicated, is that the one or               more of these polypeptidesare part of a multi-subunit callose                   synthase complex.                                                               This project will proceed along two lines.  The first will be a                 continuation of our efforts to unambiguously identify callose                   synthase subunits, and will consist of polypeptide-depletion                    experiments, topographic analysis using vesicles of defined                     sidedness, photolabeling studies using azido-probes and limited                 proteolysis.  We will continue to raise antibodies against                      individual enzyme subunits.  Second, we plan to clone and sequence              a structural gene(s) encoding subunit shown to be required for                  enzyme activity.                                                                Identification and cloning of callose synthase subunits should pave             the way for resolving the longstanding question of whether (1,3)                and (1,4) B-linked glucans are biosynthesized by a single enzyme or             distinct enzymes where each produces a distinct linkage type.  The              availability of amino acid sequences and cDNA for callose synthase              subunits will reveal whether sequence homologies exist with known               bacterial cellulose synthase genes, and therefore define the extent             to which callose and cellulose synthases are structurally related.              This research will also help pave the way to study gene expression              during cell wall biogenesis.                                                    %%%                                                                             Cellulose (1,4-B-D-glucan) is the world's most abundant                         macromolecule, with an estimated 1011 tons biosynthesized per year.             It is a major component of plant cell walls providing structural                integrity and protection against invading plant pathogens.                      Callose, the (1,3)-B-linked counterpart of cellulose, is                        physiologically important since its synthesis is induced in                     response to wounding and infection.  Callose is also found in plant             structures such as pollen tubes, sieve plants and in the cell walls             of some monocots.  B-glucans from plants and yeast are are                      economically important due to their unique agrilcultural,                       physiological and nutritional properties.  Recent studies show that             B-Glucans of mixed linkage ((1,3),(1,4)-B-glucan) from oats and                 (1,3)-B-glucan from yeast have the ability to lower cholesterol in              hypercholesteremic individuals when significant levels are                      incorporated into the diet.  The pharmaceutical industry is                     interested in fungal glucan synthases because they represent                    potential molecular targets for new drugs which are needed to treat             systemic fungal infections.                                                     Very little is known about the biochemical mechanism by which                   glucans are produced.  This project focuses on expanding our                    knowledge of the structure and function of (1,3)-B-glucan synthase,             commonly known as callose synthase, a cell wall biosynthetic enzyme             complex ubiquitous in higher plants.  In the near-term, one                     objective is continued application of basic protein chemistry to                make further progress towards the unambiguous identification of the             protein components of CS.  In addition, our knowledge of the CS                 complex has reached the point where a molecular biology component               is warranted.  Thus, a second objective is to clone selected                    components of the CS complex in order to obtain deduced amino acid              sequences for CS polypeptides.  We will then determine whether                  similarities exist with known sequences of cellulose synthase from              cellulose-producing microorganisms.  This would indicate whether                cellulose and CSs are structurally related.  This research will                 also help to gain an improved understanding of callose deposition               as part of the wound response.                                                  Research on the biosynthesis of plant-derived biopolymers has                   important scientific and economic implications.  It is critical for             U.S.-based labs to continue to play a significant role in these                 efforts.",
