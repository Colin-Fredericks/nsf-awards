 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This project supports travel and field expenses for                a team of U.S. scientists headed by Dr. Gregory Possehl from the                University Museum, the University of Pennsylvania, with                         logistical and technical backing of an Indian team, to conduct                  archeological research at the Harappan site of Babar Kot in the                 State of Gujarat in India.  The research is expected to continue                over four seasons of excavation.  The Gujarat State Department of               Archeology will provide the local support.  The site is                         strategically located between Rojdi and the major Urban Phase                   Harappan settlements of Rangpur and Lothal.  The mound is                       approximately three meters high, one of the few stratified                      Harappan sites in Saurashtra, and about 2.66 hectares in size.                  Save for surface plowing, Babar Kot is undesturbed.  The research               design at Babar Kot is based on two theoretical issues: those of                relevance to understanding the complex societies generally, and                 those relevant to understanding the Harappan civilization.  Given               the vrtually total lack of historical record for the Harappan                   Civilization, the route planned in this work is to study the                    spatial patterning, including the distribution of physical                      remains (artifacts, architecture, settlements) as well as the way               they went about doing things (subsistence systems, trading                      relations, cultural ecology).                                                                                                                                   Scope: This project is a major collaborative undertaking between                U.S. and Indian scientists in archeological research in an area                 of great scientific interest.  The costs of the research are                    shared by the two teams.  The size of the undertaking is in this                case an indication of the potential for improving our                           understanding of the Harappan Civilization, based on the sucess                 achieved in earlier excavations by the two teams in the area.",
