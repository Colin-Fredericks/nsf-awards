 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 15 years a radiation training laboratory and                      program has been established and equipped through NSF Grants,                   local school support and industry donations.  St. Mary's                        College has become a center of excellence in the training of                    radiation scientists.  This project fills important gaps in the                 program's instrumentation so that students can be properly                      prepared to enter the modern industrial and academic research                   laboratories.  Many modern scientific instruments are now                       computer based, one central processing personal computer runs                   several different instruments which are purchased as plug-in                    boards.  Operating instruments from a computer terminal is a                    fact of life in the scientific laboratory of today.  This                       method is rapidly replacing the dedicated instrument.  The                      computer based Multichannel Analyzer will give students this                    important experience as well as strengthen their laboratory                     training in many aspects of the radiation sciences.Various                      radiation detectors update the collection of detectors and                      allow students to do interesting new experiments.  The use of                   high quality, up-to-date scientific instruments has proven a                    great motivational factor for students. Their sense of                          confidence is greatly boosted by these experiences and their                    interest in pursuing graduate studies has been enhanced.  About                 60% of the physics majors and minors go on for graduate                         studies.",
