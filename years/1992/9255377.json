Providing technical assistance to active SSI projects;                     2.   Assisting SSI states through various networking                                 activities;                                                                3.   Developing a leadership process for SSI states; and                        4.   Assisting other states to develop SSI projects.                                                                                                            EDC will (1) assist each participating state in effectively                     implementing and institutionalizing its program for                             mathematics and science reform, and (2) establish a self-                       sustaining and permanent national network that will serve as                    a forum for supporting the science and mathematics education                    reform efforts underway.                                                                                                                                        Each SSI state will be supported by an EDC-based state liaison                  technical assistance team that will develop a thorough                          understanding of each state's infrastructure, resources,                        problems, and constraints.  Based on this understanding the                     team will design appropriate technical assistance strategies                    to support each state in carrying out its project goals.  In                    addition, Action Groups composed of participants from each                      state will be established to address issues common to all                       states that can be best addressed through collective effort.                    The action groups will be supported by the EDC team and its                     consultants.                                                                                                                                                    The activities that will support this effort will include                       providing ongoing targeted consultation; establishing and                       operating a communications network; organizing and conducting                   meetings, forums and conferences; developing a clearinghouse                    for state-of-the-art resources; and documenting and distilling                  new knowledge in systemic reform in mathematics and science                     education.",
