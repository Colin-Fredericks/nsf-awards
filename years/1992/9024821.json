 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments in pulsed power technologies for                       generating kilojoule energy levels economically, have made                      electrocrushing and electrohydraulic fragmentation of rocks and ore             comminution more practical.  The Phase I results have demonstrated              the effectiveness of liberating copper from copper porphyry ores                using electrocrushing and electrohydraulic fracturing techniques,               as a function of energy deposited in the ore samples, the electric              field strength, pulse width and electrode configuration.  The                   successful proof-of-concept demonstration of ore liberation of                  Phase I using electrocrushing, therefore leads to a more exhaustive             research development program for Phase II.  There are two key                   objectives for Phase II research program:  (1) to extend the Phase              I results to include two (or three) additional ore types for which              the market price is stable and sufficiently high, and to conduct                more exhaustive electrocrushing experiments with a larger number                of samples and (2) to address specific energy consumption and                   mineral recovery issues by comparing the electrocrushing and                    electrohydraulic fragmentation techniques to the traditional method             of compressive mechanical disintegration.  The experiments will be              conducted in pulsed power facilities using the optimum electrode                configurations and discharge energy levels arrived at in Phase I.               The first series of tests will be conducted in the batch mode using             both short and long pulse width discharges, followed by slug flows              stimulating laboratory scale continuous ore processing.",
