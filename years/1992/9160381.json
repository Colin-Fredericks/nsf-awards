 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) Phase 1 project is              in the general area of chemical synthesis in the subfield of                    chemical catalysis.  Enzyme catalyzed processes offer significant               advantages over traditional chemical methods in organic syntheses,              including superior efficiency, stereoselectivity, and specificity.              However, soluble and conventionally immobilized enzymes are often               inactive under typical laboratory or manufacturing conditions,                  which may include high temperatures, extremes of pH, near-                      anhydrous organic solvents, and mixed aqueous-organic solvents.                 Enzyme crystals, cross-linked using a bifunctional reagent such as              glutaraldehyde, constitute a novel form of enzyme immobilization.               Such cross-linked enzyme crystals (CLECs) are superior to                       conventionally immobilized enzymes in many respects.  For example,              the crystal lattice interactions, supplemented by chemical cross-               links, provide the individual enzyme molecules within a CLEC with               an enhanced stability that enables CLECs to function in harsh                   environments (such as elevated temperatures and organic solvents)               that would not otherwise be compatible with catalytic activity.                 These features make CLECs valuable as stereospecific catalytic                  reagents.  In this Phase I study, CLECs of pig liver esterase                   (PLE) and pig pancreatic lipase (PPL) will be investigated to                   demonstrate the practical feasibility of CLECs as laboratory                    catalysis in organic syntheses.  Esterase and lipase enzymes were               chosen for their superior catalytic characteristics compared with               current chemical methods for stereospecific hydrolysis and                      reduction.",
