 "awd_abstract_narration": "An experimental research program is                                             proposed to study inhibition of                                                 spontaneous emission in semiconductors                                          using micro dielectric structures and to                                        explore various realizations of                                                 semiconductor micro-lasers with                                                 microscopic ring cavities.  The inhibition of                                   spontaneous emission is of great interest                                       because of its potential application to low-                                    threshold lasers.  We showed recently                                           theoretically that the spontaneous emission                                     rates of excitons in a semiconductor can                                        be drastically reduced by embedding a                                           thin layer of the semiconductor in low-                                         refractive-index materials.  An experimental                                    study of this effect is proposed.  The                                          experiment will involve time-resolved                                           measurement of excitonic decay in thin                                          GaAs or InP quantum wells, or Yb-doped                                          semiconductors, surrounded by materials                                         of low refractive indices.  Later, similar                                      studies will be extended to wire-like                                           dielectric structures.  The microstructures                                     required will be fabricated via a selective-                                    etching technique.  The same technique                                          can be used to fabricate semiconductor                                          micro-ring lasers, which were recently                                          demonstrated to have low (optically                                             pumped) thresholds.  A good way to                                              obtain output from such lasers, however,                                        has not been achieved.  An experiment is                                        proposed to investigate the coupling of                                         such lasers to waveguides as an output                                          coupling method.  Various geometries and                                        active layers will be explored to determine                                     the optimal relaization of such lasers.",
