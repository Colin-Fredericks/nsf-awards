 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new family of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases, called CDPKs, has               recently been discovered.  CDPKs are unique because they have a                 novel structure with a kinase domain joined to a Ca2+-binding                   domain similar to calmodulin.  An important long term goal is to                understand the function of CDPKs in Ca2+-mediated signal                        transduction pathways.  The model plant system Arabidopsis has been             chosen for this purpose.  The foundation of the proposal is to                  determine how Ca2+ regulates CDPK activity.  A biochemical and                  molecular genetic approach will be used to test a model referred                to as a \"stream-lined version of CaMK II\".  An E. coli. expression              system has been developed to provide functional enzyme for this                 purpose.  Two approaches will be pursued to investigate the                     biological functions of a specific CDPK isoform:  1) Isoform AK1                and a mutant \"unregulated\" version of AK1, will be over-expressed               in transgenic plants to examine the effects of altering the balance             of its activity in vivo.  2) AK1's intracellular location will be               determined to provide information on its potential in vivo                      substrates.",
