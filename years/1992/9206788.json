 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical interconnects play an increasingly important                            role in computer architecture.  For instance,                                   commercial optical local-area-networks and buses                                allow for high-bandwidth, low power, and low-                                   crosstalk communication among computational                                     resources.  In addition, it is now becoming clear                               that fixed, free-space optical interconnects will have                          cost and performance advantages for wire-limited                                graph layouts.  It is not clear, however, what role                             reconfigurable free-space optical interconnects will                            play in computer architecture.  To address this                                 knowledge gap, a workshop is planned by the                                     University of Colorado consisting of about 35                                   participants from leading universities, research labs                           and companies working in computer architecture                                  and optical interconnects.  The purpose is to                                   compare the cost and performance of                                             reconfigurable optical interconnects in different                               computer architectures against conventional                                     electronic and fixed, free-space optical interconnect                           technologies.  The result of the workshop will be an                            assessment of the current and projected capabilities                            of reconfigurable optical interconnects along with                              the communication needs of future computer                                      architectures.  This will identify the critical areas of                        research in reconfigurable optical interconnects.  It                           will also place goals that must be met so that                                  computer architectures with reconfigurable optical                              interconnects will have cost and performance                                    advantages over other approaches.",
