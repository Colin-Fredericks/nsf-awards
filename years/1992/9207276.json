 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Marcus and Rosen will continue their                            investigations of the relationship between Gaussian processes and               the local times of symmetric Markov processes put into evidence                 by the Dynkin Isomorphism Theorem. A compact form of this Theorem               will be used in an attempt to obtain Borell type inequalities for               local times.  Analogous to their recent work which shows the                    equivalence of sample path properties of the local times of a                   symmetric Markov process and an associated Gaussian process they                will study the relationship between continuous additive                         functionals of a symmetric Markov process indexed by measures and               an associated class of Gaussian chaoses indexed by measures. This               will require an investigation into measure indexed Gaussian                     processes and chaoses in general. They will also try to extend                  their recent work on the law of the iterated logarithm for the                  local times of symmetric Levy processes and random walks to cover               the interesting case of recurrent random walks on a two                         dimensional integer lattice.                                                         Professor Marcus and Rosen will continue their                             investigations of the relationship between Gaussian Processes and               the local times of symmetric Markov processes.  Until recently                  these stochastic processes were not considered to be related at                 all, except in the case of Brownian motion, a relationship was                  implied by a recent isomorphism theorem of Dynkin.  This                        isomorphism has been exploited by Professors Marcus and Rosen to                show that there are deep connections between these two                          fundamental classes of stochastic processes, both of which serve                as models in countless applications to continuous time random                   phenomena.  This research could lead to significant new knowledge               about our random environment.",
