The renovated facilities will strengthen                             advanced laboratory instruction in Chemistry; will                              support emerging interdisciplinary programs in cell                             and molecular biology/ biochemistry and                                         environmental science; and will facilitate                                      collaborative student-faculty research - a hallmark                             of Colby's new undergraduate science curriculum.                                     Specifically, the proposed renovation will                                 upgrade facilities for three general areas of                                   chemistry on two floors of Keyes - biochemistry,                                analytical/physical chemistry, and chemical                                     synthesis.  In addition, the project includes an                                instrumentation laboratory area which encourages                                shared use of instrumentation and collaboration.                                The chemistry faculty, comprised of six members,                                will conduct research or research training in the                               proposed renovated facilities.                                                       The successful completion of the plan to                                   modernize Keyes will help Colby attract more                                    students to major in the natural and physical                                   sciences, will nurture the skills and enthusiasm                                that will lead them to go on to earn higher                                     degrees, and will motivate them, through excellence                             in teaching and research, to make contributions to                              the strengthening of America's scientific base.                                 Further, the availability of improved chemistry                                 research facilities will make Colby more                                        competitive as it seeks to recruit outstanding                                  young science faculty.",
