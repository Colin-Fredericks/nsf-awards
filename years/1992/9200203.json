 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Paleobiology at the              National Museum of Natural History to help support 28 undergraduate             students who will participate in both a formal curriculum and                   closely supervised independent research in areas such as                        systematics, botany, zoology, and paleobiology.  Research in and                teaching of organismal biology, systematic, and ecology has                     declined at most universities over the last decade, even though                 these fields are critical for evaluating and addressing loss of                 biodiversity and global change.  Large research museums still carry             out basic research in these fields, but have had little to do with              undergraduate education.  The Research Training Program at the                  Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History (NMNH)             is designed to address this problem by stimulating the interest of              undergraduates in natural history research through a balanced                   curriculum of lectures, labs, and independent research.  The 10-                week long summer program emphasizes an independent research project             closely supervised by a member of the scientific staff, but also                offers a set of lectures, discussions, field trips, and laboratory              and collections demonstrations.  The group activities give                      background material, and also raise issues of theoretical and                   methodological importance in natural history research.  The                     greatest strengths of the Research Training Program at NMNH are the             large number of research staff (over 120 doctoral level scientists              and 250 technicians), the breadth of research projects (e.g.                    morphological and molecular systematic of many groups of plants and             animals, morphometrics, paleobiology, behavior, ecology), the size              of the collections (more than 119 million specimens of plants,                  animals, fossils, etc.), and the libraries (over 1 million volumes,             and hundreds of natural history journals).  The combination of                  these resources with a Research Training Program that provides both             a formal curriculum and closely supervised independent research,                creates an unparalleled environment for getting undergraduates                  started on careers as researchers in the natural sciences.",
