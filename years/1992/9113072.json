 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies two reaction-diffusion problems                   arising in chemical engineering and one from climatology, each                  exhibiting a free or moving boundary.  The first problem concerns               an exothermic reaction of fractional order in a reactor or                      catalyst particle.  There may then exist a dead core (a region                  where the reactant concentration vanishes) whose boundary evolves               in time.  Particular attention is paid to a high chemical                       diffusivity approximation known as the shadow system.  The second               problem treats the interaction between fluid and solid phases,                  a frequent phenomenon in chemical and materials                                 engineering. Various properties of the combustion of a porous                   solid are studied, such as the conversion time, the conversion                  front, and the penetration front.  The validity of the so-called                pseudo-steady-state approximation is examined in a more general                 setting than previously considered.  The climatology problem                    concerns the dependence of ice-covered regions on parameters such               as the solar constant and the infrared radiation constants that                 appear in the energy balance equation.                                               This study deals with aspects of reaction-diffusion systems.               The name originated with problems such as the combustion of                     coal as oxygen diffuses through the hot coal and reacts with                    it, converting it to products.  The corresponding mathematical                  model also appears, with some modifications, in other settings:                 for instance, in catalytic converters, in ecological competition,               in the spreading of contaminants and in their removal, in                       propagation of impluses along nerves, and in climate modeling.                  The investigator's interest lies both in the mathematical                       framework and in specific applications.  Using techniques                       developed recently, he directs his efforts to obtaining estimates               for quantities of physical interest such as the time required for               conversion of the solid in a gas-solid reaction and to finding                  the effect on the earth's icecaps of a change in the amount of                  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.",
