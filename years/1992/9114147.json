 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Herbert Moskowitz of Purdue                       University to collaborate in Social Science research with                       several international scholars from the UK, Turkey and Finland                  who bring a variety of useful and complementary expertise in                    applied mathematics, statistics, management science, decision                   theory and economics to this interdisciplinary research                         project.  The participating experts are Professor Derek Bunn,                   Chairman of Decision Sciences, London Business School;                          Professor Murat Koksalan, Department of Industrial                              Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey;                  and Professors Pekka Korhonen and Jyrki Wallenius of the                        Helsinki School of Economics.  They plan to investigate                         promising theoretical, methodological and applied research in                   multiple criteria decision making and decision analysis.                        Among other topics in these fields, they will pursue research                   on human choice behavior, fuzzy modeling and analysis of                        Quality Function Deployment, and extensions of robust                           interactive decision analysis.                                                                                                                                  This research should provide new insights into several                          important issues associated with human decision making and                      problem solving.  Potential applications include the                            development of improved decision making software for business                   and industrial management.",
