 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Minority Research Enhancement Program in Power Systems                     (MREPPS)\" proposal is designed to enhance research education in the             application of systems theory, optimization, control and expert                 systems for power systems planning, operation and management by                 the use of artificial intelligence.  An outreach program and early              involvement in research are program components designed to                      increase the minority population in engineering.  Enhancement of                power systems research will advance Howard University's educational             mission by enhancing the quality of programs offered to                         undergraduate and graduate students and by providing a means of                 sharing technological breakthroughs in power systems with other                 HBCUs.                                                                                                                                                          The research component of the proposal focuses on investigating four            of the nine national needs in power systems which have been                     identified by the Electric Power Research Institute and the NSF.                The outreach component of the program will provide pre-college                  students with a more systematic exposure to science and technology,             increase the level of graduate students, and broaden the expertise              of faculty.                                                                                                                                                     Howard University is the only historically black university which               offers Ph.D. level studies in power systems, therefore, a unique                feature of MREPPS will include training of graduate students (about             12 students each year) from the HBCUs.  These students will be the              future college professors in power systems and through their                    research experience at Howard \u0131infinite transfer on program                     development at the undergraduate level will be developed!.  Faculty             researchers and prospective graduate students who specialize in                 power systems will be invited to Howard University to attend a                  week-long workshop that will address current topics in the power                industry and provide a mini-course on knowledge-based systems                   engineering and neural networks application to power systems.  A                teleconference, to be held at Howard, will link students, faculty               and researchers of HBCUs and engineers in the power industry.                                                                                                   Minority engineers, particularly those with graduate-level degrees,             remain acutely underrepresented in the field of engineering.  This              problem is especially evident in the field of power systems.  Howard            University has contributed significantly to the current pool of                 minority engineers in the power industry.  Through this program, the            University will have a grater impact on increasing the number of                minority students entering undergraduate and graduate programs in               engineering, on increasing the number of practicing engineers and               addressing faculty shortages in the field of power systems.                     Finally, the program will address national research needs in power              systems.",
