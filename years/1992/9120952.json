The                         overwhelming majority of English words begin with a strongly                    stressed syllable.  If children were aware of this regularity,                  they could use it to identify the beginnings of words in the                    speech stream.  Function morphemes, such as articles and verb                   inflections, occur at the beginnings and ends of phrases, and                   could help children to isolate these units.  Function morphemes                 also provide cues about the type of unit that has been isolated,                such as Noun Phrase or Verb Phrase.  However, we know little                    about children's representations of stress and function                         morphemes, and therefore about whether they are able to use such                cues in language acquisition.  One set of experiments explores                  the phonological and syntactic nature of function morpheme                      representations with the use of imitation picture pointing tasks.               Another set of experiments is designed to extend previous work on               the effect of stress patterns on children's morphemic and non-                  morphemic weak syllable omissions, and to provide new information               about their representation of the canonical stress patterns of                  their language.",
