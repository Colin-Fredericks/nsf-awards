This year notes the                   fourth year that the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer                     Science Education (SIGCSE) Symposium and the National Science                   Foundation have cooperated in holding sessions at which                         grantees from the USEME programs have presented their results,                  and Program Directors have made outreach presentations.  The                    participation of the grantees has grown each year.  There has                   also been developed a \"birds of a feather\" session which                        provides an informal setting for the faculty to ask questions                   about the NSF programs in undergraduate education.  Typically,                  there will be about 600 faculty attending the Annual SIGCSE                     Symposium, and about 2000 faculty attending the Annual ACM                      Computer Science Conference (ACS).  One of the goals of this                    project is to increase the interest in the NSF undergraduate                    programs by the ACS attendees.  The presentations at SIGCSE are                 becoming a fundamental component for the dissemination of the                   results of the USEME programs to the Computer Science education                 community.  This award allows the principal to continue the                     effort, and supports the anticipated increase in the amount of                  grantee participation in the future.  With the requested                        support, continued increase in faculty interest in                              undergraduate computer science undergraduate education is                       expected.",
