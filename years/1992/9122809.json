 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interest in science has long centered on scientific knowledge,                  especially \"high\" theory, but the past decade has seen the                      convergence of scholars in many disciplines upon scientific                     practice--the doing of science, the process of making theories,                 facts, instruments, institutions--as a key topic for research.  Dr.             Pickering is developing a general analysis of the nature of                     scientific practice.  The empirical base for this work consists                 primarily in two extended case studies from his own work, the                   search for quarks in high energy physics and the development of                 quaternions in mathematics, and three shorter studies drawn from                the secondary historical literature.  He is also weaving in other               ethnographic and historical studies of science as appropriate.  He              is relating his analysis to more familiar perspectives on                       scientific knowledge through discussion of contemporary debates on              the role of nature, reason and the `social' in science and related              debates on the objectivity, relativity or historicity of scientific             knowledge.  He is also discussing disciplinarity in science                     studies, and suggests that a shared interest in practice can                    provide the basis for a genuine synthesis in this field.",
