 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA)                                 will renovate an existing building on the campus                                for use as a high energy physics detector research,                             development and construction facility.                                               UTA has recently launched a major new                                      initiative in high energy physics research to take                              advantage of the unique opportunity offered by the                              proximity of the campus to the SSC laboratory.  A                               large part of the high energy groups initial                                    research activity will be the development and                                   construction of major components of the SDC                                     detector.  Due to the size and complexity of these                              components, a large amount of space is needed for                               their development/construction.                                                      The initial research program to be carried out                             in the renovated building will center on the SDC                                detector muon system.  This research program offers                             excellent opportunities for the involvement and                                 training of graduate students from small scale                                  prototype work through major component                                          construction.  The program will also involve a                                  close interworking with many other institutions in                              SDC and will thereby ensure highly productive use                               of the renovated facility by both local physicists                              and support staff and visitors who will combine                                 activities at the facility with their work directly                             at the neighboring SSC laboratory.",
