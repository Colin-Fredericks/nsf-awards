 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major purpose for the philosophy of science is to explain, and                hence to justify, what science is and why its theories should be                accepted as true.  Another aim of philosophy of science was to                  prescribe what \"good\" science is.  Contemporary philosophy of                   science, however, has largely abandoned this prescriptive task and              has instead concentrated on a descriptive mode of operation.  This              role is not an unimportant one.  In an age of skepticism about                  science and acceptance of mystical and occult sources of knowledge              it is important that the basis of scientific truth be fully                     understood.                                                                                                                                                     Dr. Oberdan is examining one of the founders of modern philosophy               of science, Moritz Schlick, the leader of the Vienna Circle of                  Logical Positivists.  Dr. Oberdan aims to provide a biographical as             well as intellectual background to Schlick's work.  Under this                  grant, he is examining Schlick's early life and career, especially              the development of his philosophical views of relativity theory and             the initial stage of his Positivist thought.  The importance of                 this study is directly related to two central issues in the                     philosophy of science:  the nature of causality and the positivism-             realism dispute.  Given the rise of quantum theory with its                     probabilistic foundations, uncertainty principle, and wave/particle             duality, the questions of causality and the \"real\" existence of                 theoretical entities have become even more contentious in                       contemporary physics.  The positions that Schlick offered are                   important for our understanding of how philosophy and science have              addressed these questions.  Dr. Oberdan's study promises to make                significant contributions to our understanding of the foundations               of these debates.",
