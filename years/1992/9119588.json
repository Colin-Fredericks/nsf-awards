 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the observable traits of plants and animals are                    affected by many genetic factors.  The theory for the inheritance               of such traits is known as quantitative genetics.  For the past                 60 years, animal and plant breeders have used quantitative                      genetics to improve domestic animals and crop species.  In the                  past 20 years, quantitative genetics has swept into evolutionary                biology and is revolutionizing our understanding of evolutionary                processes and the genealogy of living species (phylogenetics).                  In applying quantitative genetic theory on an evolutionary time                 scale, one needs to assume that the system of inheritance remains               unchanged.  To make a strong test for constancy of inheritance,                 one needs good estimates of the inheritance systems for multiple                populations which, in turn, have known evolutionary                             relationships.  These requirements are difficult to meet and so                 strong tests for constancy of inheritance have not yet been                     conducted.  The current project is a proposal for such a strong                 test using natural populations of garter snakes and water snakes.               The strength of the proposal rests on the facts that: (1) large                 numbers of families can be sampled in each population to give                   good estimates of inheritance, (2) multiple populations and                     species can be sampled and (3) the phylogenetic relationships of                the populations and species have already been established using                 modern molecular techniques.  The rationale of the proposal is                  that by using natural populations of snakes that are ideally                    suited for comparative studies of inheritance, one can test a key               assumption in evolutionary studies and perhaps uncover a                        principle of genetic constancy that applies to all species of                   plants and animals.",
