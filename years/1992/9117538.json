 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research consists to two components: First, is the                     observational constraints necessary for the project.  A large                   amount of information on the history of plate motions and on the                distribution of possible driving forces will be compiled and                    represented in ways that are useful for dynamical calculations.                 Second, modelling techniques will be developed for application to               present-day plate motions to understand the forces that have                    controlled past plate motions, inferring also the history of                    associated mantle flow and viscous stresses.  These models will be              useful not only in understanding plate tectonics and mantle                     convection, but also the long-term history of mantle heterogeneity,             along with associated variations in the geoid, dynamic topography,              Earth rotation,a nd sea-level.  The overall goal of this research               is to create a computer laboratory for studying the dynamics of                 past plate motions and their influence on the geophysical (and                  geochemical) evolution of the plate.  This project is jointly                   funded by NSF and NASA.",
