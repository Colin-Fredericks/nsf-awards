 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns mathematical research on partial                     differential equations.  In particular, work will be done on                    boundary value problems for two different linear partial                        differential operators on closed domains in the plane.  The first               is the Tricomi equation for transonic fluid flow and the second                 is a model equation for electromagnetic wave propagation in                     axisymmetric cold plasmas.  The primary objective of the work is                to characterize well-posed problems for singular solutions with                 data prescribed on the entire boundary by studying the location                 and strength of possible singularities to these problems. The                   methods to be employed are a mixture of modern microlocal                       analysis with classic objects such as special functions.                        Explicit solution operators will be employed to obtain precise                  information on the location and strength of the resulting                       singularities.  The explicit methods used in these models should                result in a more general understanding of mixed type problems and               provide a foundation for the study of nonlinear boundary value                  problems of mixed type.  In addition, the precise description of                the singularities in these models is of scientific interest                     because their presence has physically reasonable interpretations.               In the fluid models, singularities correspond to the possible                   presence of shock waves in transonic regimes, and in the plasma                 models, singularities are related to possible plasma heating due                to energy absorption from the electromagnetic wave propagation.                      Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them.",
