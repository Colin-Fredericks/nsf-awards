 "awd_abstract_narration": "This approximately 42-month leadership project is a                             cooperative effort of the University of Virginia, and the                       Charlottesville City and Albemarle County School Systems.  It                   will prepare 20 three-member teams of lead teachers with a                      combination of integrated physical science content mastery,                     conceptual thinking skills, constructivist learning concepts,                   hands-on teaching methods, and leadership abilities.  The                       project will be conducted in two over-lapping phases of                         approximately 28 months each, and will provide the 60                           participating teachers with 270 contact hours (9 credit hours)                  in courses that integrate physical science, appropriate                         methods of science education, and strategies for effective                      leadership.  It is anticipated that all of the 130 K-8                          classroom teachers from the Charlottesville City schools, and                   many from Albemarle County will be reached through inservices                   and support provided by the lead teachers, the principals, and                  the project staff.                                                                                                                                              This leadership project is appropriate for the Teacher                          Enhancement Program because of its well-developed plan to                       prepare lead teachers in science and, with their assistance,                    to provide science inservice for all of the elementary                          classroom teachers within the city district and of the                          teachers from participating schools in Albemarle County.                                                                                                        The cost-sharing amount to be contributed by the University of                  Virginia is approximately 27% of the amount requested from                      NSF.",
