 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of an                           anthropology student from UCLA studying how different cultural                  backgrounds affect the experiences of abused wives.  Battered                   women from three low-income groups: non-Hispanic whites, Mexican-               Americans, and Mexican immigrants newly arrived to the US will be               interviewed in depth about their experiences. The research will                 focus on the social, cultural and psychological framework out of                which battered women interpret and cope with their violent                      relationship.  The student will interview about 75 women, aged                  21-35, mothers of at least one child, to elicit their life                      stories.  In addition objective scales of acculturation and                     conflict will be administered to each woman.                                                                                                                    This research is important because household violence is a major                problem in our society.  Increased understanding of the role of                 cultural backgrounds in explaining how women cope with violence                 can help policy makers design programs which are more culturally                sensitive and appropriate for diverse sub-cultures in our                       society.",
