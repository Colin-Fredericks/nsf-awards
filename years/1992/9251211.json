 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project by the physics faculty of Bethany College to                  improve the quality of the senior- level Modern Physics                         Laboratory course through the acquisition of some new                           equipment.  This project has enabled the department to change                   the emphasis of the course from a repetition of classic                         experiments in modern physics to the carrying out of more                       current, topical experiments in solid-state physics and modern                  optics.  Students are able to gain hands-on experience                          investigating important microscopic physical phenomena using                    modern instrumentation and data acquisition equipment, which                    serves as a vital introduction to the world of modern physics                   research.  The upgrade also enables students to verify and                      reinforce concepts discussed theoretically in several upper-                    level courses.  In addition, their experiences serve as a basis                 for independent research projects carried out in the students'                  senior year.  The equipment is also be used for these research                  projects.The lab course focusses on two active areas of physics                 research:  solid state physics and modern optics.  Equipment                    consists basically of three items:  a cryogenic dewar, and an                   electromagnet for solid state studies, and an optical table                     with accessories for optical experiments.  With existing                        equipment and further departmental acquisitions, these will                     allow a range of modern experiments and techniques to be                        explored.",
