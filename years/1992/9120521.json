 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at Northwestern Univ-                   ersity supports interactive, interdisciplinary research with the                overall theme of \"the science of new materials\".  The research is               organized in five major thrust areas.                                                                                                                           Research on electroactive polymeric and molecular materials                     addresses charge transport phenomena in these materials.  It                    includes synthesis, processing, characterization, and theory.                   Emphasis during the current funding period is being broadened to                include the coupling of charge transport with magnetic,                         photochemical and redox processes.  The thrust on heteroepitaxial               growth of strained layer structures addresses the epitaxy of                    compound semiconductor materials, with emphasis on nucleation,                  growth, and relaxation mechanisms in strained layer structures;                 electronic and optical properties of these structures; and                      theoretical modelling and simulation of experimental results.                   Research on macromolecular nonlinear optical materials is                       concerned with the design, synthesis, processing,                               characterization and theory of polymeric materials whose                        nonlinear optical characteristics make them promising candidates                for eventual use in optical and optoelectronic devices.  The                    growth and properties of novel electronic and photonic metal                    oxide thin films is being investigated in a fourth thrust area.                 Finally, a new thrust group addressing unconventional                           superconductivity in heavy fermion materials is studying a                      uranium-platinum compound, both theoretically and experimentally,               in order to understand its superconducting properties and                       elucidate the change in electronic structure that leads to                      delocalized electronic behavior.  A long range goal is to provide               a basis for better understanding of other superconducting                       materials, including the high temperature oxide superconductors.                                                                                                The MRL also supports the development, operation and maintenance                of major central facilities for materials research.  It provides                seed funding for exploratory research, supports programs in                     education and the development of human resources in the materials               field, and is developing a range of programs for outreach to                    industry.  The MRL currently supports the activities of about 30                faculty members from five academic departments, 8 postdoctoral                  research associates, 28 graduate students, 20 undergraduates                    including about 10 minority students, and 6 technical and                       scientific staff members.  The MRL central facilities also                      support a substantial amount of research that is funded from                    other sources.  The Northwestern MRL is directed by Professor                   Robert P.H. Chang.",
