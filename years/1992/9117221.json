 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposal is to:  (1) Complete the                 characterization of the process whereby the phycocyanobilin                     prosthetic group is attached to the alpha subunit of C-phycocyanin.             Genetic evidence indicates that the products of genes cpcE and cpcF             play a role in the addition of bilin to the alpha subunit                       apopolypeptide.  We have expressed the two proteins encoded by                  these genes, CpcE and CpcF, in E. coli and are now in a position to             examine the biochemical role of these proteins in the bilin                     attachment process.  (2) Complete the characterization of bilin-                bearing linker polypeptide associated with the major phycoerythrin              of marine synechococcus sp.  WH8020.  No previous complete                      structure of bilin-bearing linker polypeptide has been elucidated.              This information on the number, type and location of bilins                     attached to such linker polypeptides is central to the                          understanding of the pathways of energy transfer in the                         phycobilisome.                                                                  %%%                                                                             Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are a widely distributed group                 of bacteria which carry out oxygen-evolving photosynthesis                      similar to that characteristic of higher plants.  Recently,                     marine unicellular cyanobacteria were discovered to contribute                  ten to twenty percent of the primary productivity in the                        oceans.  The studies to be performed are directed at achieving                  a detailed understanding at the molecular level of the                          structure and biosynthesis of the photosynthetic apparatus in                   these organisms which are adapted for optimum utilization of                    the blue-green light which predominates below the surface of                    the open ocean.",
