 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the three-year Constructive Assessment Project is                   to enhance student equity, as well as validation and                            communication aspects of alternative assessment methods in                      mathematics.  First year project activities will focus on the                   objective \"to enable more in-depth relevant understanding of                    student achievement on the part of students themselves\".  This                  objective will be addressed by investigating the needs,                         interpretations and values of approximately 200 students who                    are participating in alternative assessment activities within                   the constructivist Visual Mathematics programs.  The research                   will proceed at three levels.  Ten Teacher-Researchers at five                  sites will generate research questions, and will investigate                    these with the support of workshops, monthly meetings and                       classroom visits by the PI.  The PI and a Research Associate                    will also research the issue across the five sites through                      observation, interview and textual analysis.  And a group of                    Faculty Associates will explore the issues at the concept                       level through library research and data analysis.  During the                   second and third years activities will address on the                           objective \"to advance the general state-of-the-art of                           assessment practices\" by using the outcomes of the first-year                   investigation to develop classroom guidelines which                             incorporate a learner-oriented, constructivist approach to                      assessment.  The project will provide an integrative model for                  the constructive involvement of teachers, students and                          technology in a broad range of assessment methods, and will                     provide a base of grounded theory for future research.",
