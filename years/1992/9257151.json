 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. Yu Xie under the National               Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.  The                    objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young faculty             in science and engineering, to enhance the academic career of                   recent Ph.D. recipients, and to foster contact and cooperation                  between academia and industry.  Dr. Xie has already made                        significant research contributions to the fields of sociology and               demography, and he has the potential to become a leader in academic             research and education.                                                              This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research              interests in the sociology of science and in the development of                 statistical methods for the social sciences.  Dr. Xie plans to                  continue his research on the causes of women's underrepresentation              in science.  This research is based on longitudinal data for high               school students, recent college graduates and experienced                       scientists and engineers.  A related research interest of Dr. Xie's             is the social determinants of academic achievement in mathematics               and science among high school students and the reasons for the                  relatively low achievement of students in the United States                     compared with other developed countries.  Dr. Xie also plans to                 continue his work on statistical methodology and demographic                    techniques.  He will develop models for analyzing event history                 data with fewer restrictions than currently available model, and                he plans to develop new models for comparing social mobility across             nations and time.",
