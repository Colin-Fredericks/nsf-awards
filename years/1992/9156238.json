 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rensselaer is developing a series of cross-disciplinary                         activities at the science/computer interface for use in the                     basic science courses at Rensselaer and other universities.                     These materials will allow the introductory courses in                          mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, engineering,                 and earth/environmental science to reinforce one another                        through shared topics and activities. The materials will also                   have the effect of encouraging the instructors of the                           introductory courses to work more closely together than has, in                 the past, been traditional at most universities. The materials                  to be developed will include text materials, computer based                     problem-solving materials, simulations, microcomputer based                     laboratory activities, and video materials. These materials for                 topics relating to nonlinear phenomena are being developed as                   a first step toward full implementation and as a demonstration                  of the feasibility of this approach.                                                                                                                            The project centers on use of these workstations in university                  level freshman and sophomore courses. It rests on a major                       university initiative: the 4500 undergraduates have unlimited                   access to 500 state-of-the-art scientific workstations. Of                      these, over 320 are earmarked for the exclusive use in freshman                 and sophomore courses. Rensselaer is preparing to educate                       students in the basic sciences at the science/computer                          interface. The structures of existing courses are being                         modified in order to allow students to confront developing                      interface technologies. These include nonlinear modeling,                       scientific computation, statistics, geometric modeling, and                     algorithm issues, each from a multidisciplinary vantage point.                  Nonlinear modeling has been selected as the initial project.",
