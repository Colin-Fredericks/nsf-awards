 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aquatic larvae of the midge, Chironomus, produce silk-like fibers               which are composite polymers of secretory proteins synthesized by               the larval salivary glands.  How these proteins assemble into                   water-insoluble fibers as they exit the gland through the salivary              duct is not known.  The special lobe of Chironomus thummi salivary              glands consists of four cells which synthesize a unique secretory               protein, ssp160.  The proximity of the special lobe to the salivary             duct implies that ssp160 may somehow be involved in the assembly                and processing of secretory proteins into supramolecular fibers as              they exit the gland via the duct.  The objectives of this proposal              are to learn:  1) the primary structure of ssp160 by cloning and                sequencing its cDNA, 2) determine the level at which its cell-                  specific synthesis is regulated by measuring in vivo rates of                   transcription and steady-state levels of mRNA and protein, and 3)               begin to dissect its involvement in Chironomid secretory protein                disassembly and reassembly in vitro.                                            %%%                                                                             This project will enhance our understanding of the composition,                 assembly and processing of a unique biomaterial, Chironomid silk.               Furthermore, the information gained will be applicable to the                   design of novel peptide-based biomolecular materials.",
