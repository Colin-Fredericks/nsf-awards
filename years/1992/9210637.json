 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with thin film materials with a                      one-dimensional, spatially periodic composition variation.                      These are referred to as composition modulated alloys (CMAs),                   and they can exhibit extraordinary mechanical, magnetic and                     optical properties especially when the periodicity wavelength                   is of the order of nanometers.  The proposal suggests using                     electrochemical deposition, rather than the conventional                        vacuum deposition, to fabricate the CMAs, and the study will                    focus on the deposition of NiFe films.  NiFe alloys with                        uniform composition are used, because of their high saturation                  magnetization and high initial permeability, for read/write                     heads for computer disk drives and as underlayers for                           perpendicular recording media.  CMAs of NiFe have the                           potential for high performances in magnetic data storage                        because of the extra degree of freedom.  The films will be                      deposited using a uniform injection (rather than rotating                       disk) flow cell.  Flow pulsations are used to periodically                      vary the composition of the film as it is deposited on the                      electrode surface.",
