This                 workshop, convened at recommendation of the NSF Chemistry                       Advisory Committee, brings together some twenty-five young                      American and British scientists who are likely to become                        leaders in the field.                                                           %%%                                                                             The formation of carbon-carbon bonds in a predictable manner is                 of utmost importance to organic synthesis.  In this context,                    reactions which proceed through the intermediacy of                             organometallic complexes have become increasingly important.                    Organometallic chemistry bridges the traditional disciplines of                 organic and inorganic chemistry by allowing metals to act as                    templates for organic reactions. The primary aim of this                        Bilateral NSF-SERC Workshop on Organometallics in Organic                       Synthesis is to expose young scientists to the wider community                  of international scholarship and to build the foundation for                    long term international collaborations.",
