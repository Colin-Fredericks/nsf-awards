 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science education in the United States was largely based on models              drawn from Germany.  Young Americans interested in pursuing a                   career in science went to Germany for advanced education.  This                 practice continued well into the 20th century--for example, Robert              Oppenheimer, \"father of the atomic bomb,\" studied quantum physics               in Germany.  Thus, if one wants to understand science education in              America, one must understand its origins in Germany.                                                                                                            A central focus in studies of the development of science in Germany             are the scientific institutes of the universities.  Their creation              in the last third of the 19th century sparked an \"institutional                 revolution\" that Thomas Kuhn has called the \"Second Scientific                  Revolution\" owing to its importance for providing the                           organizational structure that made possible the remarkable                      intellectual advances of the modern era.  To date, most studies                 have investigated the institutes of physics, chemistry, or                      physiology.  Dr. Richmond is presenting a detailed archival study               of the institutionalization of zoology in Munich University.  One               of the largest and most important centers of zoology in Germany,                Munich harbored all of the major research programs of this period:              Naturphilosophie, \"scientific\" zoology, and experimental zoology.               By examining the cognitive, institutional, and socioeconomic                    factors that influenced the development of zoology in Munich over               the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the study provides             new information about the fine structure of the operation of one                institute, and its findings can be applied more generally to                    broaden our understanding of the development of zoology during this             critical period in its history.",
