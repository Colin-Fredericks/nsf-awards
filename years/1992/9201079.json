 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently there has been considerable                                            interest in rare earth-doped fiber lasers.                                      These sources exhibit very low lasing                                           thresholds due to strong pump                                                   confinement, they are tunable, and they                                         have exceptionally large gain bandwidths.                                       These properties make them attractive                                           sources for optical communications and                                          short pulse generation.  Unlike the fiber                                       geometry, rare earth-doped waveguide                                            lasers in a planar configuration offer the                                      potential to integrate multiple components                                      on a single glass (or crystal) substrate.                                       The excellent transparency of glass, its                                        resistance to chemical attack, along with                                       its good mechanical properties and low                                          cost make it an ideal material for this                                         application.  The primary thrust of the                                         proposed work is the development of new                                         active and passive rare earth-doped,                                            channel, waveguide devices on planar                                            substrates.  Particular emphasis will be                                        placed on the monolithic integration of                                         multiple components including lasers,                                           directional coupler filters and distributed                                     feedback resonators.  Device fabrication                                        will proceed predominantly in special melts                                     of neodymium and erbium doped,                                                  geranium-rich, alkali glass using thermal                                       ion exchange techniques.  Single mode                                           waveguide lasers operating at 1.06 um, 1.3                                      um and 1.5 um, will be demonstrated and                                         completely characterized.  Single                                               longitudinal mode behavior is to be                                             achieved in the lasers using integrated                                         distributed feedback structures.                                                Fabrication of these structures will proceed                                    either by corrugating the waveguide                                             surface or by direct photoionization of                                         germanium-oxygen defect centers in the                                          glass.  Both uniform and tapered DFB                                            grating structures are to be considered.                                        Second harmonic generation in channel                                           waveguides fabricated in rare earth-doped,                                      germanium-rich glass will also be                                               investigated.",
