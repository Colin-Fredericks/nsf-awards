 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cessation of passive margin sedimentation in Paleozoic                 time and the beginning of arc magmatism in Mesozoic time in                     southern Arizona are clearly established, and the deposits                      associated with both Paleozoic sedimentation and Mesozoic volcanism             have been or are being studied.  The nature of the transition                   itself remains unknown, however, although coherent and plausible                models have been provided for a similar time span in the Mojave                 Desert and elsewhere along the Cordilleran margin.                                   This project will investigate epiclastic, volcaniclastic, and              volcanic strata associated with the Paleozoic/Mesozoic boundary in              southern Arizona.  An integrative geologic investigation will                   involve:  1) Detailed field mapping of sections where depositional              sequences from Paleozoic to early Mesozoic strata are known or                  inferred; 2) Facies analysis of strata along the contact, in order              to determine a) the tectonic setting of earliest Mesozoic                       magmatism; 3) U-Pb zircon b) the tectonic setting of earliest                   Mesozoic magmatism; 3) U-Pb zircon geochronology on volcanic rocks              at the contact to establish the initial timing of magmatic                      activity, or where appropriate as a tool in correlating sequences.              This research will fill an important gap in our understanding of                late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the                      southwestern Cordillera by shedding light on the timing and style               of the transition from passive-margin sedimentation to subduction               and magmatism in southern Arizona.",
