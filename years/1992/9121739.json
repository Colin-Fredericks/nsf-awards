 "awd_abstract_narration": "In  this Mage proposal, the PIs propose to determine the                   hydrocarbon and  hydrocarbon composition of air samples collected               during the ASTEX/MAGE campaign.  Proposed measurements include                  approximately 25 chlorocarbon compounds containing one or two                   carbon atoms and 50 or more hydrocarbons ranging in molecular                   weight from methane to the terpenes (C4 - C10).  The overall                    objective is to provide information for the construction and                    testing of detailed photochemical models to examine the chemical                cycles controlling each of the measured species and of the                      unmeasured reactive free radicals such as OH and Cl.  The Pis                   propose to set up a remote laboratory in Miami, Florida where gas               chromatographic analyses of grab samples obtained from aircraft                 will be conducted.  (Note: this is a change from the originally                 proposed remote site of Santa Maria; see new work statement and                 budget sheets.)                                                                      In this MAGE proposal the PIs plan to determine the                        hydrocarbon and halocarbon composition of air samples collected                 during the ASTEX/MAGE campaign.  With knowledge of these                        concentrations, detailed photochemical models can be constructed                and tested for the chemical cycles controlling each of the measured             species, and also of the unmeasured reactive free radicals such as              HO and Cl.  Specifically, the measurements will provide data (or                upper limits) on the concentrations of approximately 25                         chlorocarbon compounds containing  one or two carbon atoms and                  numerous hydrocarbons.  In particular, the chlorofluorocarbon                   compounds and carbon tetrachloride are very long-lived (>50 years)              in the atmosphere and are entirely anthropogenic.  These compounds              are excellent markers for air contaminated by recent injections                 from urban or industrial areas.  Shorter-lived chlorocarbons are                also excellent markers of anthropogenic activity, and the                       correlations among such species are useful for distinguishing                   between air masses mixed from multiple urban sources and                        homogeneous air masses subjected to different HO  radical                       exposures.  Additionally, several alkanes appear to have their                  primary origin in anthropogenic activities, and on occasion furnish             through multiple correlations enough information to identify                    particular source regions.",
