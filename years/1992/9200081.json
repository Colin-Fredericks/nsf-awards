 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much attention has been focused recently on the apparent worldwide              decline in amphibian populations.  While the decline of some                    species may be attributed to habitat destruction, a perplexing                  number of declines have taken place at protected reserves on all                major continents. Although the mostly anecdotal evidence for                    worldwide declines is compelling, studies providing quantitative                data on changes are required in order to understand and mitigate                the source or sources of biological trauma responsible for the                  declines.                                                                            The present project undertakes such a study for Lower Central              America (Panama and Costa Rica), where spectacular declines among               amphibian populations were among the first to be recognized.  The               study will involve:  resampling previously investigated sites                   following the original sampling protocols; establishing a series of             attitudinal transects in areas of obvious declines and where                    declines are not evident for future repeated sampling; and sampling             individual species believed to be particularly sensitive to                     environmental deterioration.  Data obtained from the sampling                   program will demonstrate the extent of decline, whether the entire              amphibian association or only a subset is affected and whether an               apparent difference between upland localities (marked decline in                many species) and lowland (no clear declines overall) sites is                  real.  It is anticipated that the project, the first regional study             of amphibian declines utilizing a repeatable, quantitative                      approach, will answer fundamental questions as well as serving as               a model for similar comparative studies in other geographic                     regions.",
