 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study regulation of gene expression by                      interaction with transcription factor proteins which bind certain               specific sequence elements in the DNA. Two classes of transcription             factors have been described: AP1 and CREB. In order to bind DNA,                the proteins must first dimerize. One of the AP1 proteins, cJUN,                can form homodimers and respond to the TRE sequence element, or can             form heterodimers with any of three CREB proteins and bind to the               CRE sequence element. Each of these complexes has a unique trans-               activation potential. All potential dimer complexes will be trans-              lated from cDNA clones in reticulocyte lysates, and binding to                  oligonucleotides of known sequence will be determined by gel                    retardation analysis. Constructs of a plasmid containing the                    reporter gene luciferase coupled to the various oligonucleotides                will be used to determine transactivation potential at various                  points in the cell cycle.                                                       %%%                                                                             This proposal is to study proteins which enhance and promote the                transcription of DNA, the genetic material. Two kinds of proteins               (a total of four) will be used. The proteins contain two                        interesting structural features: DNA binding regions and \"leucine               zippers\", which allow the proteins to form pairs of identical or                different proteins. Each dimer binds to a unique sequence in DNA;               the sequences will be determined and compared. The importance of                the stage of the cell cycle for one type of dimer or another will               be determined using luciferase from firefly tails as a reporter                 molecule.",
