 "awd_abstract_narration": "New quality engineering technologies, that include                              methodologies for robust system/product/process design and the                  incorporation of quality considerations in the modern                           integrated engineering design/manufacturing system, are in a                    rapid state of development.  These methodologies employ                         engineering/statistical experiment design, loss functions,                      quality function deployment and elements of the controversial                   Taguchi parameter and tolerance design methods.  Based on                       modern quality/reliability philosophies and technical                           communication tools, they enhance the role of quality                           engineering to include planning and improvement, in addition to                 quality control.  They also extend the concept to include the                   total life cycle of the system or product.  Engineering                         Colleges lag industry in both the teaching and researching of                   these technologies, and most engineering undergraduate                          education is essentially limited to the traditional concepts of                 quality control.  The objective of the Quality Engineering                      Workshop is to present these new quality engineering                            technologies, to provide successful examples of their                           application, to illustrate these concepts through laboratory                    experiments and computer simulations, and to demonstrate and                    compare associated computer software.  The workshop should                      assist faculty to play key roles in the development of quality                  engineering courses at their own schools by convincing them of                  the importance of expanding traditional quality control courses                 to quality engineering, and providing them with materials and                   strategies for playing a significant role in the total quality                  management movement in their institution.",
