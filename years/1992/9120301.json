 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves collaborative research involving personnel                from the Field museum in Chicago, the Papua New Guinea (PNG)                    National Museum, the Department of Anthropology at the University               of PNG, and the Museum for Volkerkunde in Dresden, Germany.  The                researchers will study the extent and pattern of exchange                       relations in the West Sepik district of PNG, which have                         integrated local communities into larger human associations or                  \"regional systems\".  The project will build on prior research                   based on a collection of artifacts at the Field museum.  Using                  photographs of these artifacts, the researchers will describe the               manufacture, use, cultural meaning and local socioeconomic                      significance of the area's material culture, will reconstruct                   historical patterns of manufacture and trade, and study the                     current changes in material culture.                                                                                                                            This project is important because the study of material                         culture in one small scale, tribal society can reveal general                   principles of the creation and maintenance of sociality among                   diverse communities.  Although PNG is legendary for innumerable                 small cultures speaking different languages, they were all                      connected by trade systems, and this sort of research can reveal                the principles which cross ethnic boundaries to relate diverse                  communities.  These principles can then be used to understand                   cross-ethnic relations in other places in the world.",
