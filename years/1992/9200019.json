 "awd_abstract_narration": "In biomes1 ranging from subarctic taiga forests to tropical                savannas and woodlands, selective browsing by mammals can alter                 the composition and diversity of vegetation and, as a result, the               rate of nutrient cycling.  The objective of this project is to                  gain an understanding of this process, because it is of critical                importance to sound ecosystem management.  The interaction                      between browsing mammals (specially elephant), vegetation, and                  nutrient cycling in the savanna-woodlands of the Zambezi River                  Region of Zimbabwe will be studied.  This system was selected                   because 1) it is a classic example of the more general                          mammal-vegetation-nutrient cycling problem, 2) the interaction                  between the African elephant and its habitat is, in its own                     right, of major concern to international conservation, 3) the                   Zimbabwe Department of Parks and Wildlife is strongly supporting                this project, and 4) The United States Agency for International                 Development (USAID) has funded the nutrient cycling portion of                  this study.  Specifically, patterns of browsing in the                          Colophospermum mopane woodlands, one of Africa's major vegetation               types and a critical habitat will be studied.  Repetitive                       browsing by elephant is the major form of natural disturbance                   influencing patch dynamics in mopane scrub and woodland, because                elephant repeatedly browse some patches of mopane in preference                 to others with the results that the vegetation of repetitively                  browsed patches is degraded.  This proposal will test 3                         alternative explanations of the rebrowsing of mopane by elephant                1) sodium enrichment of the soil in the vicinity of preferred                   patches, 2) nutrient (e.g. nitrogen) enrichment of the soil, or                 3) proximity of browsed patches to traditional paths of travel to               focal resources such as water or mineral licks.",
