 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, sponsored by the Center for Science,                              Mathematics and Technology Education at Colorado State                          University, will offer a three year interdisciplinary science                   program to 40 middle school and junior high school teachers                     from representative districts in the state of Colorado.  Each                   summer these teachers will be taught the fundamental concepts                   of biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics and physics                         appropriate to the grade level using a content intensive                        thematic approach.  In the academic year following the summer                   program the participants, with the help of project staff,                       will work toward implementing the new curriculum in their                       schools.  They will do this by incorporating the new modules                    into the everyday curriculum, by conducting whole school                        projects and by offering teacher-to-teacher workshops.  When                    the project is completed there will remain a cadre of teacher                   leaders who will be able to disseminate innovative                              instructional models for middle school interdisciplinary                        science.                                                                                                                                                        The NSF award is being matched with funds from the school                       districts and the university by an amount equivalent to 52%                     of the NSF grant.",
