 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted to elucidate basic mechanisms and                    evolution of acoustic communication, using treefrogs as a model                 system.  These animals produce stereotyped vocalizations and                    respond selectively to playbacks of synthetic signals that                      contain features that carry information about the species and                   quality of a potential mate.                                                                                                                                    The goals of this project are: (1) to quantify the degree of                    selectivity of female treefrogs in the presence and in the                      absence of a closely-related species with similar calls; (2) to                 determine the extent to which females avoid a nearby sound source               that emits calls of another species in order to reach a distant                 source of attractive calls of the same species; and (3) to                      determine if artificially-induced changes in chromosome number                  affect key features of the calls of males and the selectivity of                females for those key features.  The last study is aimed at                     learning if the natural difference in chromosome number in two                  species of gray treefrogs is responsible, at least in part, for                 differences in their communication systems.                                                                                                                     The acoustic communication of treefrogs is easier to study than                 that of many other kinds of animals, but the general principles                 that emerge from Dr. Gerhardt's research will contribute to                     growing scientific understanding of communication systems and how               they work in reproduction and survival of a wide range of diverse               species.  Such understanding is valuable for control of pest                    species as well as for protection of endangered or economically                 valuable species.",
