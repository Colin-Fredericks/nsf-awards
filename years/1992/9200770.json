 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to Department of Biology at Emory                     University to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates               SITE in the broad area of Developmental Processes.  Recruitment                 efforts will focus on students at primarily undergraduate                       institutions and on women and minority students.  Ten students from             other institutions will be invited to participate based on academic             records, evidence of research potential and interest, and                       recommendations from faculty at their home institution.                                                                                                         The program has the following objectives: (1) to provide formal and             informal introductions to the processes of science; (2) To provide              an intensive research experience in one subdiscipline; (3) To                   provide perspective by examining alternative approaches to                      processes of development at different hierarchical levels; and, (4)             To maximize participant interaction with other undergraduate and                graduate researchers, their specific research mentor, and his/her               research group.                                                                                                                                                 Students will select a research mentor and project from the                     following areas: genes and development, cellular differentiation,               development of behavior, and developmental processes in ecology and             evolution.  Students will work under the direct guidance of one of              the 22 participating research mentors.  All participants will                   attend workshops on scientific methodology, research design, data               analysis and interpretation, and scientific communication skills.               Students will design and conduct an independent project in                      consultation with their mentor.  They will participate in weekly                progress discussions with other student researchers and the project             directors.  Each focal area will also have weekly lab meetings to               discuss project progress.  Students will interact with their                    research mentor, his/her research group, including graduate                     students and technicians, and will attend departmental seminars.                Each student will prepare an oral presentation and a written report             at the conclusion of his/her project.",
