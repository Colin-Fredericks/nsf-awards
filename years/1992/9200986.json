 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of the effect of bridging groups on the                        magnetic properties of high-spin organic molecules will be                      conducted. Emphasis will be placed on defining the structural                   parameters which are necessary to maximize coupling of multiple                 spin centers in organic molecules. A program of targeted                        synthesis of specifically defined high-spin precursors will be                  coupled with measurements of the magnetic properties of the                     resultant high-spin molecular species: this will establish the                  type of bridging groups which most effectively couple via an                    intramolecular process. A highlight of the research will be the                 development and subsequent evaluation of magneto-optical                        switches which are capable of rapid changes in magnetic                         properties when exposed to appropriate wavelengths of light.                    %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing investigations of Professor D. A. Dougherty at the                   California Institute of Technology. These studies will be                       focused toward the synthesis and design of organic molecules                    which exhibit magnetic properties when exposed to heat or                       light. The target molecules, which are effectively known as                     organic magnetic switches, will be evaluated for their magnetic                 properties by utilization of specialized equipment designed to                  operate at liquid helium temperatures. Advances in this field                   will provide the basic information required to develop organic                  magnets with unique optical properties for utilization in                       electronics applications.",
