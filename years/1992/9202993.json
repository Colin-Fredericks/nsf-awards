 "awd_abstract_narration": "In plasma immersion ion implantation (PII), ions                                are extracted directly from a plasma environment                                (in which the target is located) and accelerated                                through a high voltage sheath into the target.  With                            a high ion-density plasma produced by electron                                  cyclotron resonance (ECR) sources, the space                                    charge region between the plasma and a negatively                               biased target can sustain a potential difference up                             to 200kV, with an ion implantation flux as high as                              10 16/cm1-sec.  this dose rate is equivalent to 10                              monolayers of implanted atoms per second, and is a                              factor of one hundred to a thousand higher than                                 conventional ion implantation.  Other unique                                    features of this technique include: no ion mass                                 selection, no beam transport optics, and ion energy                             and angular distributions controlled by the plasma                              gas pressure and the applied bias waveforms.  By                                adding a sputtering electrode into the plasma which                             is powered by a separate voltage supply (i.e., a                                triode configuration), the system can be used for                               sputtered ion implantation and ion assisted                                     physical/chemical vapor deposition.   Work to date                              on silicon device processing indicates the PIII is                              well-suited for high throughput, large area surface                             processing and is compatible with the cluster tool                              concept for future manufacturing equipment.  In                                 the grant the exploration of the formation of                                   metastable metallurgical phases due to the high                                 implantation rate of the PIII technique and the                                 possibility of performing high dose rate ion beam                               mixing and deposition concomitantly.  this will be                              achieved by using programmable pulses with                                      variable pulse width, duty factor and voltage levels.                           The proposed work is to explore the science and                                 engineering of PIII for synthesis and modification                              of novel electronic and optical materials.  The PI                              will also investigate using PIII to synthesize high                             bandgap semiconductors such as GaN and AINm,                                    to modify surface chemistry for selective metal                                 deposition, to form novel thin dielectric films with                            composition gradients, to perform bandgap tailoring                             with buried GeSi alloys, and to improve the                                     mechanical stress and electromigration reliability of                           submicron interconnects.",
