 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of quality educational programs to attract and retain               underrepresented minorities in science and engineering is a well-               established national priority.  This proposal describes a program               designed to improve the educational framework for emerging minority             scientists and engineers.  The proposal will focus on undergraduate             education as its core component as well as the essential elements               required to increase the percentage of students in post-graduate                science and engineering programs.                                                                                                                               The partners in the proposed alliance represent diverse programs,               yet have remarkably common objectives.  The unifying goal is to                 build on the existing knowledge base relative to minority                       participation in science and engineering and to expand the                      available options to enrich programs at partner institutions and                beyond.                                                                                                                                                         This Alliance has been formed to develop strategies increase access             and opportunities for minority students in science and engineering.             The goals of the alliance are: 1) to improve the quality of the                 learning environment for minority science and engineering students              at all schools, 2) to substantially increase the number of minority             students graduating with degrees in science and engineering, and 3)             to develop and implement effective methods of attracting talented               minority students who would not otherwise choose science or                     engineering as a career.                                                                                                                                        The project will emphasize collaborative learning approaches,                   positive and sustained interaction with faculty, intensive                      interaction with other support persons, and hands-on research and               internship experience.  The Alliance will focus on developing and               implementing innovative methods for interesting community college               students in science and engineering careers and will concentrate on             the transition point to graduate school.",
