 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project A.S.T.R.O. is a program to bring both amateur and                       professional astronomers into the schools to assist fourth                      through ninth grade teachers in the classroom, with day and                     evening observing activities, with individual student projects,                 and with inspiration to provide a greater appreciation of                       science and lead students to science and engineering careers.                   Amateurs are a largely untapped resource for science education                  and this project will explore the impact their enthusiasm and                   experience can have in providing significant assistance to                      teachers and students in grades where crucial science attitudes                 are formed.  The California-based pilot program will -- after                   the development of appropriate protocols and materials -- use 40                astronomers and 40 teachers to test the effectiveness of                        astronomers (especially amateur astronomers) as school resource                 agents.                                                                                                                                                         The project has four related components: 1) the assessment of                   existing programs of this type and of materials to help both the                visiting scientists and the teachers; 2) workshops to train the                 astronomers, prepare the teachers, and continue developing                      activities and resources; 3) school visits and other activities                 by astronomers for a full school year; and 4) the production of                 a loose-leaf Teachers' Resource Notebook and a How-to-Manual for                bringing astronomy to the schools.  Formative and summative                     evaluation by those involved and a professional evaluator will                  be a key component of each phase.  A set of guidelines for the                  national dissemination of the project will also be developed.",
