 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three year New Jersey Institute of Technology Summer Science                Camp serves seventy-eight seventh grade, low income, educationally              disadvantaged African-American and Hispanic students from Newark                public schools.  The non-residential program is comprised of a                  four-week summer component with eight follow-up sessions.                       Instruction is provided in science and math, based on the theme of              Marine Science, oral and written communication skills, as well as four          field trips to various marine science locations in New Jersey.  In              addition, students receive academic, financial and career counseling            and are exposed to formal and informal interaction with minority and            women professors and students already engaged in science based                  careers.  Parents/guardians are involved throughout the program.                Project partners include:  the Newark Board of Education, the New               Jersey Marine Science Consortium and the Protestant Community                   Center, Inc, a community based parent organization.  Follow-up                  activities will be carried out during each academic year which provide          additional math/science opportunities, academic and career                      counseling, and monitoring of student progress.",
