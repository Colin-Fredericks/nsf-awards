 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many years ecologists have identified pathogens as                     theoretically important forces influencing basic processes in                   natural plant populations.  These processes include, first, the                 evolution and/or maintenance by natural selection of sexual                     reproduction (which provides novel combinations of genes that may               enable offspring to  resist local pathogens genetically) and,                   second, the evolution of dispersal by offspring (which may help                 them physically escape local pathogens).  In the first process                  the pathogen population responds to host plant genetics, while in               the second it responds  to host plant density.  In addition, the                pathogen can be expected to respond strongly to its physical and                biological environment.  This research will determine for one                   plant-pathogen system which of these three factors or their                     combinations the pathogen population responds to most strongly.                 This then sheds light on  the actual role the pathogen population               is having in the plant population's biology.  The plant being                   studied is the rush, Juncus dichotomous and the pathogen is a                   parasitic smut fungus,  Cintractia junci.  These organisms occur                together in the Long Island pine barrens.                                             The results of this research directly apply only to                       nonagricultural plants and pathogens, but its methodology can be                a model for applied problems.  With increasing public concern                   about the health and environmental costs of using agricultural                  pesticides and given the fact that they are not fully effective,                detailed population studies on the interaction of pest organisms                with crop plants are needed to suggest safe and effective ways of               reducing crop losses.  Population studies involving pathogens and               crops and incorporating genetics, density, and variables together               could be very useful.                                                           **",
