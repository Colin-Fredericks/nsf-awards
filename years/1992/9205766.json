 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to examine the molecular basis                of the physiological phenomenon termed `competence' which is used               here to describe the appearance of responsiveness to a hormone                  that results in the expression of new genes. The appearance of the              competent state is thought to be due to structural changes in                   regulatory regions of these genes that permit the binding of                    proteins, such as hormone receptors and other transcriptional                   factors, to specific nucleotide sequences. This study should help               us to understand how hormones regulate gene expression.                              Two genes expressed during egg development in the mosquito,                Aedes aegypti, will be examined; a vitellogenin and a vitelline                 envelope protein gene, both of which are under the control of 20-               hydroxyecdysone. We have shown that the vitellogenin gene of the                newly enclosed adult female is not capable of responding to 20-                 hydroxyecdysone, and that competence to respond appears during the              first two days after eclosion in response to juvenile hormone. We               propose to use a mobility shift assay to follow changes in the                  binding of proteins to the regulatory regions of these two genes                during the acquisition of competence and after exposure to 20-                  hydroxyecdysone and juvenile hormone.",
