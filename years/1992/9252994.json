 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is relative to a compartmental model of the                 cell growth cycle to better understand the triggering mechanism                 for the initiation of DNA synthesis and mitosis.  The model was                 first proposed and analyzed by Busenberg and Mahffy who                         showed that the increase in cell size can trigger biochemical                   oscillations leading to DNA synthesis.  The relation between                    nutrient supply and increase in cell size is, however, now well                 understood.  In addition, the geometrical shape of the cell is an               important factor in the triggering mechanism and so far only the                case of a spherical cell has been treated.                                            The research will investigate the effect of nutrient supply               and the shape of the cell on the initiation of DNA synthesis.                         The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                    opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    teaching two sections of an elementary differential equations                   course, which will enable the P.I. to interact with many students in            their freshman or sophomore years; organizing, jointly with                     Busenberg, a weekly Mathematical Biology Seminar; giving a                      series of lectures on her own research; and inviting applied                    mathematicians from other universities as guest speakers, six of                whom would be women; providing guidance and counseling,                         especially to women students.",
