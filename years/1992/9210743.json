 "awd_abstract_narration": "Streptomyces is a genus of soil bacteria that undergoes                         differentiation in response to nutrient limitation.  Among the                  bacterial genera known to differentiate, Streptomyces stands out                because differentiation of this genus is a reproductive                         developmental process: one filamentous mycelial community divides               into thousands of autonomous, uninucleate spores.  To understand                the molecular basis of cellular division and differentiation in a               relatively simple organism, we have isolated and characterized                  nonsporulation mutants of Streptomyces griseus and have identified              a gene (orf1590) involved in streptomycete sporulation.  A defect               in orf5190 may result in the premature and irregular formation of               sporulation septa, pointing to spore wall biosynthesis as the                   aberrant process in orf1590 mutants.  Previous studies implicate                transcriptional and translational mechanisms in the regulated                   expression of orf1590 and the activity of its gene product.  Our                overall objective is to define the function of orf1590 in                       streptomycete sporulation by characterizing the product of orf1590.             We will use molecular techniques to determine the number of                     polypeptides encoded by orf1590, identify proteins that accumulate              subsequent to expression of orf1590, and clone the genes encoding               these sporulation-specific proteins as well as proteins that are                likely to play a major role in the formation of sporulation septa.              These experiments have also been designed to extend our dissection              of the developmental defect in nonsporulating mutants.                          %%%                                                                             Continued analysis of orf1590 and other Streptomyces developmental              genes can be expected to reveal a variety of intricate and novel                regulatory cascades central to cellular division and development.",
