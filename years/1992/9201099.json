The Intermountain Flora                 is a six-volume series treating the natural floristic region                    consisting of Utah, nearly all of Nevada, Southern Idaho,                       Southeastern Oregon, and small parts of Wyoming, California, and                Arizona.  Five volumes have been completed.  The final volume has               been begun and will be completed in the proposed three years.                   Preparation of the Flora entails extensive study of the plants in               the field as well as in the herbarium, and also requires a                      thorough bibliographic inquiry.                                                      Aside from its intrinsic scientific interest, Intermountain                Flora is of fundamental importance in the preparation of                        environmental impact statements in connection with possible                     mining or other industrial development in the region, and is a                  source of information on threatened and endangered species.  Land               managers working for the Forest Service, Bureau of Land                         Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service                also find Intermountain Flora indispensable.",
