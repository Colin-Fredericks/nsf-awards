 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine geological and geophysical studies of the Ross Sea and                   Weddell Sea continental shelves provide evidence that the ice sheet             grounded near the shelf edge in these areas during the late                     Wisconsinan, and that the retreat of the ice sheet to its present               position was rapid and probably episodic.  This Award supports a                project which will establish the most recent (late                              Wisconsin-Holocene) history of ice sheet advance and retreat in                 Ross Sea.  The objectives include: 1) reconstruction the late                   Wisconsin paleodrainage regime, including ice stream drainage                   divides; 2) reconstruction of former grounding zone positions; 3)               constraint of the timing of ice sheet retreat from the shelf; and               4) acquisition of geophysical, sedimentological, and                            paleontological data which may provide indicators of the                        environmental factors that may have influenced to ice sheet                     retreat.  This is a joint effort between Rice University, the                   University of Colorado, and Hamilton College.  The project involves             experts in a wide variety of fields, and will interface with                    glaciologists, physical oceanographers, and climatologists who will             address the problem of ice sheet stability and the record of                    climatic and glaciological change.",
