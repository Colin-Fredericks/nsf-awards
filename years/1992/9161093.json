 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant commercial opportunity lies in providing software            systems which take real world engineering problems, expressed in                engineering rather than mathematical terms, and convert these problems          into systems of mathematical equations.  These equations may then be            analyzed using the symbolic and numerical facilities of a general               purpose mathematical mathematics package.  This approach separates              application specific engineering knowledge from the application                 independent capabilities of general purpose mathematical software.  In          the last four years, Variational Geometry has emerged as natural and            powerful language for the expression of mechanical engineering                  problems; particularly problems in the realm of engineering mechanics.          The goal of this project is to develop an engineering mechanics                 package which will serve to convert a variational geometry based                description of the engineering problem into a symbolic mathematical             description, which may then be analyzed inside a general purpose                mathematical package.  The Phase I research will establish the                  feasiblity of taking this approach and the performance gains which may          be realized.",
