 "awd_abstract_narration": "An International Symposium on Atomic Layer Epitaxy(ALE), a                      relatively new subfield of epitaxy, is being held to assess the ALE             field, and to establish ties between universities, research                     institutions, and industry. It is expected that top scientists in               the field will attend, and that the symposium will provide an                   effective forum to discuss and delineate the critical scientific                issues in this research area, and to consider and define the                    approaches and techniques needed to address them. Understanding and             controlling processes at the atomic level are becoming increasingly             important for electronic and photonic materials, and ALE represents             an advantageous way of achieving layer-by-layer control through the             self limiting aspects of the process to yield accurate layer                    thicknesses and uniformity on an atomic scale over wafer-scale                  dimensions.                                                                     %%%                                                                             An evaluation of the status of ALE, and recommendations by the                  symposium participants for the emphasis of future work, and their               assessment of the most important contemporary research issues will              be of great value to the understanding and development of the                   technique of ALE, and for its subsequent utilization in the field               of microelectronics.",
