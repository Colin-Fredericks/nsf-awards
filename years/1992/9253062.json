The SACNAS annual conferences are primarily         designed to stimulate the interest of underrepresented minority faculty         to continue careers in the sciences and for students to pursue                  doctorates in science and engineering.                                                The conference has components that are designed to increase the           educational and professional opportunities for faculty and students such        as students sharing their research through poster sessions and faculty          presenting their research in culturally relevant issues.  These                 conferences serve as an important mechanism to strengthen the national          support network of individuals and institutions interested in increasing        the representation of minorities in the sciences and engineering.                     The funding is requesting to support 78 students and faculty to           attend the 1992 conference and to participate in a planning conference          for a future symposium on engineering.  The invited faculty and students        complete for the few allocated slots available.",
