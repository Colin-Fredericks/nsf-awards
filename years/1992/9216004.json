 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of our proposed research is                             to design, analyze and develop a neural network                                 fuzzy adaptive controller model for complex                                     processes capable of learning fuzzy control rules                               using process data and improving its control                                    through on-line adaption.  The learned                                          improvement should be according to a performance                                objective function that provides evaluative                                     feedback; this performance objective should be                                  broadly defined to meet long-range goals over time.                             Fuzzy control has proven effective for complex,                                 nonlinear, imprecisely-defined processes for which                              standard models and controls are either inefficient,                            impractical or cannot be derived.  Hitherto,                                    procedures for deriving fuzzy control, however,                                 have been mostly as hoc heuristics.  The learning                               ability of neural networks can be used to                                       systematically derive fuzzy control and permit on-                              line adaption to optimize control.  The operation of                            neural networks integrates very naturally with fuzzy                            logic.  The neural networks will be designed and                                tested using simulation software and simulated                                  data, followed by realistic industrial data to the                              extent possible.  The statistical procedures of the                             learning process will be investigated and evaluated                             with standard statistical procedures (such as                                   ANOVA, graphical analysis of residuals, etc.).  The                             computational advantage of dynamic programming-                                 like methods of optimal control will be used to                                 permit on-line fuzzy adaptive control.  Tests for the                           consistency, completeness and interaction of the                                control rules, as well as tests for stability, will be                          applied.  Comparisons to other methods will be                                  made so as to identify any advantages of the                                    resulting model.",
