The Consortium will provide networking                              opportunities for mathematicians, mathematics teachers, and                     mathematics educators, building on the structure of the 33,000                  member MAA.                                                                                                                                                     Activities include workshops to be held at regional section                     meetings, the training of undergraduate students as                             counselors, and dissemination of information through                            presentations at national meetings and a newsletter.  In                        addition, a handbook on how to start and conduct an                             intervention project and a directory of existing projects are                   to be produced and widely distributed.                                                                                                                          By the third year of the project the Consortium is expected to                  include 90 or more projects and 7,000 newly recruited minority                  students with their teachers as participants.  The long range                   goal is to increase the number of minority students reached by                  mathematics-based intervention projects in the year 2000 to                     more than 15,000.",
