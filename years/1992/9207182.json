 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two of the major participants in the Bletchley Park work                   in breaking the World War II German High Command \"Enigma                        Codes\" are present at Virginia Tech during the Spring                           semester 1992.  The University plans to conduct a series of                     four hour-long oral interviews of Dr. I.J. Good and Dr.                         Donald Michie concerning their involvement in the Bletchley                     Park activities, decryption and early computing developments                    during World War II, and their contributions to statistics,                     computing sciences and artificial intelligence since 1945.                                                                                                      The principal investigator has arranged for experienced                         writers and professionals skilled in oral interviewing with                     computer pioneers to participate in this oral history                           project.  It is expected that the resulting collection of                       archival material will result in several publications in the                    Communications of the ACM, the Annals of the History of                         Computing and other journals associated with the intelligence                   and statistics communities.  Elements of the set of                             interviews will also be considered for inclusion in TV and                      Radio series.                                                                                                                                                   This award is for travel funds and subsistence                                  during the interview period for the interviewers.  Partial                      support is also being provided by Virginia Tech, the Virginia                   Academy of Sciences, the Association for Computing Machinery,                   and the American Statistical Association.//",
