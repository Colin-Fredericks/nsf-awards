The                         stewardship of such  forests within Everglades National Park                    requires understanding how their composition may have been                      altered by an increased frequency of fire following the partial                                                                                                                                                                                 drainage of the Everglades in the last century.                                      Such questions can be answered by constructing a simple                    computer model in which the abundance of certain types of trees                                                                                                                                                                                 (e.g. shade tolerant or shade intolerant) is predicted in forest                                                                                                                                                                                that burn at differing intervals of time.
