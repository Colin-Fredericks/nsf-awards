 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas Science and Mathematics Renaissance is designed to                    reform science and mathematics education for all of its                         students by reforming curriculum and assessment through                         changes in teacher development.  The project will develop                       Renaissance Centers that will house teams of master                             teachers, scientists and mathematicians, and higher                             education faculty to develop and implement a model of reform                    for preservice and inservice programs.  The project has the                     following objectives:                                                                                                                                           1.
