 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long range goal of the proposed work is to understand the                   nature and mechanism of regulatory genes that inversely affect the              expression of the white eye color gene.  It is believed that this               type of regulatory effect is involved in the expression of most                 types of structural genes.  The four currently known inverse                    regulators of white will be precisely localized, genetically and                cytologically, via x-ray and P element mutagenesis as a prelude to              molecular cloning.  Cloning of two of these genes will reveal their             nature and provide the means to address the molecular mechanism of              action on white by sequence analysis, in vitro binding tests and                genetic dosage studies with transformed copies.  Each of the four               inverse regulators, individually as well as in combinations, will               be tested for an effect upon white mRNA levels in developmental                 profiles, as well as for a coordinate response from scarlet and                 brown, which cooperate with white in pigment deposition.  Each will             be tested for an effect on a white promoter-reporter construct to               examine the requirement of the w promoter.  A refined functional                analysis of the white promoter will be conducted to better localize             the sites required for interaction with the four regulators.  This              analysis will be conducted by deletion and site directed                        mutagenesis of the promoter, which will then be placed driving the              alcohol dehydrogenase structural gene.  These constructs will be                tested to determine the four inverse regulators and examine the                 context within which these regions work.                                                                                                                        The proposed experiments will contribute to an understanding of the             inverse regulation phenomenon and address whether there is a                    connection between such regulatory genes and the biological                     phenomena associated with chromosomal dosage such as compensation,              the inverse effect, aneuploid syndromes, and position effect                    variegation.***                                                                                                   //",
