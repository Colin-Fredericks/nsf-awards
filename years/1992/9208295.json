 "awd_abstract_narration": "A successful individual must function trophically (i.e. to eat but              not be eaten) as well as reproductively (i.e. to mate and produce               successful offspring). These strong and sometimes divergent                     pressures can create trade-offs between the optimal phenotypes for              foraging versus reproduction. However, it is seldom possible to                 study the concurrent effects of sexual and trophic selection on the             evolution of morphology. Recent laboratory and comparative studies              show that morphological variation in bluegill sunfish , Lepomis                 macrochirus, is intimately related to both reproductive and                     foraging success. The data suggest that females adapt                           morphologically to the demands of the foraging niches of lakes                  whereas the morphology of nesting males responds to changes in the              intensity of intrasexual selection.                                                                                                                             The proposed research investigates the interaction between                      selection on trophic morphology and sexual morphology in bluegill.              Morphological and behavioral comparisons among populations                      collected from different lake types will correlate phenotypic                   variation in feeding and reproductive abilities. Experimental                   crosses and common garden rearing of young will attempt to identify             a genetic basis for phenotypic variation. A manipulation of nesting             male density in a natural lake will assess the degree of behavioral             and morphological flexibility of individual males, and quantify the             relationship between phenotype and nesting success under different              social conditions. This research may eventually address critical                questions about the relative importance of sexual selection and                 trophic radiation in the evolution of the genus lepomis.",
