 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diagnostic techniques based on video analysis and digital image                 processing are implemented using inexpensive educational                        computers and home-video systems.  Coupled with laser-based                     imaging systems, these techniques enable a quantitative                         understanding of the details of unsteady, multidimensional                      flows.  This permits us to address a major need in                              undergraduate fluid dynamics education: we can teach about                      unsteady flows, and equip the engineering graduate with the                     understanding and skills needed to make flow control                            innovations in a variety of applications.  A laboratory is                      proposed, to be organized around the existing strengths of a                    modern aerospace fluid dynamics curriculum, to test this                        concept for a year.  Success will lead to  a new way of                         teaching fluid dynamics, where students will work hands-on with                 actual , dynamic flow images as part of their courses.  The                     project consists of designing and implementing an experimental                  image database, using it in course assignments, developing and                  teaching a new course on advanced flow diagnostics, and                         developing course material for a new Flow Control course.  The                  results will be disseminated by means of image data discs,                      manuals and a Conference paper.",
