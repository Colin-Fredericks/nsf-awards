 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing hardware, digital memory systems, and high speed                    computer networks have progressed to the point where building                   very large digital document collections and providing facile                    distributed access to these collections is practical and                        economical.  However, many difficult problems still stand in the                way of implementing such systems.  The time is ripe to begin                    building a broad science base to support this activity and to                   begin academic programs at universities to produce the PhD's                    needed to advance progress in this area.                                          This award funds a three day workshop to bring together about                 30 key researchers in the area of information capture and access.               Participants represent broad coverage of the research area and a                balance between industrial and academic and between project                     implementors and more science base oriented individuals.  The                   workshop will be held November 12-14, 1991 in Ithaca, New York.                 The coordinators are John Hopcroft, chair Computer Science                      Department, Cornell University and Gregory Zack, manager Xerox                  Design Research Area.                                                             The primary objectives of the workshop are to determine the                   state of the art in information capture and access, to identify                 key research efforts and projects, and to highlight research                    direction where progress is likely.  In addition the workshop                   will identify common infrastructure that would foster cooperative               research efforts.  The Xerox Corporation is a co-sponsor of the                 workshop.  //",
