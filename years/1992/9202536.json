 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project has three technical thrusts:                                                                                                                   1.  The design of knowledge based PSEs (Problem Solving                             Environments) for PDE (Partial Differential                                     Equation) based applications.                                                                                                                               2.  The development of a software engineering framework                             for solving PDE problems quickly and efficiently on                             a network of parallel machines with multimedia                                  front-ends.                                                                                                                                                 3.  The development of an infrastructure of scalable                                algorithms to support the solution of certain                                   PDEs on a variety of massively parallel machines.                                                                                                      PDEs are the fundamental mathematical tools for describing the                  physical behavior of many application processes in science and                  engineering.  Most of the existing PDE software systems deal                    primarily with the solution of specific classes of PDE                          problems on sequential or vector machines.  This project will                   study the design and implementation of the software                             engineering platform, ParPDElab, for generating PSEs and the                    related algorithmic infrastructure for any class of PDE                         problems and PDE based applications.  The hardware facility                     assumed consists of a network of parallel processors with                       different architectures and software environments.                                                                                                              The primary design goal in ParPDElab is to create a problem                     solving and programming environment that shifts the emphasis                    from programming and hardware issues to the analysis of                         science and engineering issues.  This environment will be                       almost machine independent and will attempt to unify some of                    the well known parallel computational paradigms.  It will be                    knowledge based in the sense that it will be aware of its                       infrastructure and the compatibility requirements of the                        atomic elements involved.  Furthermore, it will be capable of                   making some decisions for the user.  The system will be open                    ended and the easy interfacing of foreign systems will be one                   of the primary considerations in the design of ParPDElab.  To                   achieve the above design objectives, one must address the                       issue of integration of numeric, symbolic, multimedia, and AI                   processing.  This integration will be attempted by utilizing                    existing technologies while developing some new methodologies                   for the future.",
