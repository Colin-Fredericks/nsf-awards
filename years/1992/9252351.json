 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1988 the Department of Physics & Astronomy of Drake                          University embarked on a major revision of its undergraduate                    curriculum for majors.  The introductory two years have by now                  been completely reformed to stress computer usage and                           investigations, both in the lectures and in the laboratories.                   This project is extending the computer intensive curriculum                     into upper-division courses.  The department is inheriting                      additional laboratory space in its current building to be                       vacated by the department of chemistry.  The project has                        acquired six Macintosh IIci computers with Mathematica                          software, as well as six Tennelec PCA Multiport-E multichannel                  analyzer boards with IEEE-488 interfaces.  The Macintosh                        computers are located in a computation laboratory which also                    serves as a classroom for physics instruction.  The use of                      Mathematica is being introduced into several upper-division                     classes.  The microcomputers are also being used in an                          astrophysics laboratory based on image processing, and in                       undergraduate research participation.  They are being used in                   a nearby nuclear radiation laboratory for lab courses during                    approximately one-half of one semester per year.  There,                        coupled by cable to the Tennelec interfaces, they are                           functioning as multichannel analyzers.",
