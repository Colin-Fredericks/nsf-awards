 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Conference of Lawyers and Scientists (NCLS), a joint               body of the American Association for the Advancement of Science                 and the American Bar Association, will address ethical and legal                aspects of computer use and abuse in two interdisciplinary,                     invitational conferences.  A broad based advisory committee will                oversee all aspects of the project, including preparation of                    meeting agendas, selection of authors and topics for commissioned               papers, development of invitation lists, and dissemination                      activities.  A call for open submissions of papers, in addition                 to commissioned papers, will be issued and places at the meetings               will be reserved for those selected.  Conference one will address               the manner in which ethics and the law frame issues of computer                 use and abuse.  Discussions will encompass current statutes and                 law enforcement efforts related to computer abuse.  They will                   also look at the role of extra-legal institutions in shaping                    responsible computer use and discouraging and providing remedies                for abuse.  The conference will consider what professional,                     legislative and other public policy remedies are available.  The                second conference will examine international aspects of these                   issues.  It will include foreign experts, and discuss different                 models for encouraging ethical behavior among computer users and                for limiting problems of abuse.  The international focus and                    participation will help to set the stage for future international               cooperation.  Two conference reports will be distributed.                       Primary dissemination of the conference papers will be through                  journal or book publication, as well as in summary articles in                  journals and newsletters of professional and policy groups.",
