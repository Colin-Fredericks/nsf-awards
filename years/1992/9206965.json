 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cowen will study the structure of bounded linear operators                 on the Hardy Hilbert space, the Bergman Hilbert space, and                      related spaces of analytic functions on the unit disk,                          approaching problems on concretely presented operators in order                 to gain insight into more general problems.  He will work on                    unifying results concerning composition operators on Bergman and                Hardy spaces into a theory of composition operators on spaces of                analytic functions emphasizing similarities between spaces and                  minimizing reliance on special features of particular spaces.                        Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the               infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,               when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has                the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                   matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                  operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                    associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                      underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,               and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.",
