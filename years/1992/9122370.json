 "awd_abstract_narration": "A recent, widely quoted study has concluded that a five to ten                  fold increase in economic activity will be required over the next               fifty years in order to meet the needs of a burgeoning world                    population, as well as to begin reducing mass poverty.  Continued               economic growth of this magnitude portends an ecological dilemma.               On the one hand, the requisite growth for poverty reduction will                require further depletion of apparently dwindling stocks of                     natural resources and deterioration of the environment.  On the                 other hand, unless poverty is reduced significantly and soon,                   pressure on diminishing global stocks of basic resources will                   increase rapidly.  The proposed solution to this dilemma is                     sustained development which aims at improving living standards,                 without diminishing natural resource stocks or degrading the                    natural environment.  Closely related to the idea of resource                   sustainability of a resource is the notion of resource                          depreciation, which is analogous the familiar concept of capital                depreciation as is applied to an asset like a machine tool.  The                purpose of this research is to develop a theory of sustainable                  resource management and a consistent measure of resource and                    environmental depreciation.                                                                                                                                     The methodology developed for measuring resource and                            environmental depreciation will be applied to the problem of                    global energy use and greenhouse warming, with a particular focus               on Indonesia whose oil is a major export commodity.  Policies                   aimed at effectively dealing with the threat of global warming                  must balance energy conservation, against the relative cost                     effectiveness of alternative mechanisms for limiting emission of                greenhouse gases.  This study will place particular emphasis on                 carbon dioxide emissions.  The specific modeling problem is to                  compute an efficient profile of global energy use, taking in to                 account the externality costs of carbon dioxide emissions, to                   recompute the model after the introduction of projected                         distortions, and then to compute the value of environmental                     depreciation.",
