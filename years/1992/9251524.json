A partnership with International Business Machine will assist                   in developing the project.  The Division of Natural Sciences                    has been funded to build a multi-functional facility comprising                 a network that will tie together a central computer classroom                   with a series of laboratory satellite stations. Using computer-                 assisted instrumentation, this project will enhance our                         curriculum in four ways:  (1) upgrade our offerings in the                      structural/functional aspects of cell biology from a                            descriptive to an analytical approach to biological principles;                 (2) enhance the analytical and conceptual quality of research                   opportunities for undergraduates via our required, year-long,                   Senior Project, in a way that will expand the principles that                   can be addressed and introduce students to modern                               instrumentation;  (3) allow the use of analytical microscopical                 techniques appropriate for students concentrating in ecological                 and environmental biology;  and (4) allow active participation                  in computer-controlled data collection and analysis with an                     integrated system in which students collect data and digitize                   images in a microscopy laboratory and prepare analyses and                      reports in the computer classroom.",
