 "awd_abstract_narration": "While it is now accepted that syntax affects the application of                 postlexical phonological rules (P-rules), much less is known about              the effect of semantics, in particular focus, on these rules.  The              Rhythm Rule (RR) of English, which has been found to be sensitive               to F, will be examined in detail to determine precisely where and               how it applies.  Since the domain of application of RR is generally             taken to be the Phonological Phrase, the main problem to be                     addressed is how focus can be taken as input, along with the usual              syntactic information, to P-rules that apply within this domain.                In addition, since RR contributes to the overall rhythmic pattern               of a sentence, a question that must be addressed is whether there               is one universal rhythmic mechanism of language that also accounts              for the effects of RR or whether RR is part of the specific                     phonological system of English, and is thus treated by a mechanism              distinct from that which handles overall rhythmic alternations.                 Experimental data, which will be brought to bear on the theoretical             issues at the core of this research, will consist of recordings of              subjects reading sentences a) in isolation, b) embedded in                      paragraphs, c) with special intonations (i.e., yes-no question and              incredulity patterns) and d) with the syllable \"ma\" in reiterant                speech.  The sentences will contain the appropriate conditions for              RR (i.e., stress clashes) in different positions with regard to                 both syntactic and focus structure.  The recordings will be                     analyzed both perceptually and acoustically.                                                                                                                    The proposed research will investigate the organization of the                  phonological component of grammar as well as its interaction with               other components of grammar, especially syntax and semantics.                                                                                                   This project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                         opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    arranging weekly meetings of the women graduate students, who will              be joined once a month by male students, with emphasis placed on                developing the skills needed for careers in linguistics (abstract               writing, conference presentations, conducting research, publishing,             applying and interviewing for jobs, and teaching)--and women's                  problems (for the single gender sessions); inviting prominent women             linguists invited within the context of the regular colloquium                  series; and teaching an advanced seminar on the interactions of                 phonology with the other components of grammar.",
