Specifically, novel                                                 optical fibers will be used for two                                             types of in-situ measurements:                                                  temperature and stain.  Temperature                                             sensors will be synthesized with                                                rare-earth dopants that will permit                                             spatially resolved temperature                                                  measurements in the range of 500-                                               1200oC.  Strain sensors based on                                                Fabry-Perot gratings and using                                                  optical time domain reflectometry                                               will both be investigated.  The                                                 temperature and strain sensors that                                             are developed will be incorporated                                              in fiber-reinforced, ceramic and                                                intermetallic matrix composites that                                            will be produced by chemical vapor                                              infiltration (CVI).  Because these                                              materials already contain fibers,                                               the incorporation of additional                                                 optical fiber sensors will not                                                  significantly perturb the                                                       microstructure.  A variety of                                                   advanced, thermal gradient CVI                                                  processes are currently being                                                   developed, and the optical fiber                                                sensors that will be developed as                                               part of this program will make it                                               possible to monitor temperature                                                 gradients during processing.  A                                                 relatively simple thermal gradient                                              CVI system will be used to make in-                                             situ optical fiber temperature                                                  measurements during composite                                                   fabrication.  The microstructure of                                             these materials will also be                                                    characterized quantitatively, and a                                             numerical model of the infiltration                                             process will be developed to analyze                                            both the temperature gradients and                                              the microstructure evolution.                                                   Comparisons between the modeling                                                calculations and the experimental                                               measurements will provide insight                                               into the infiltration process, and                                              demonstrate the potential for using                                             optical fiber temperature sensors.                                              The strain sensors will provide                                                 measurements during processing, and                                             more importantly, they will make it                                             possible to measure strain when the                                             composite is in use.  These in-situ                                             strain measurements offer a novel                                               method to study the stress-strain                                               behavior of the material.  In                                                   brittle matrix composites, the                                                  matrix phase typically begins to                                                microcrack long before the material                                             fails, thus these in-situ strain                                                measurements are particularly                                                   important because it will be                                                    possible to monitor the degradation                                             of these materials before                                                       macroscopic failure actually occurs.",
