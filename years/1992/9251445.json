 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of a computer-based statistics laboratory to                    support an instructional program  will allow students to                        actively learn statistical reasoning skills.  The objective is                  to improve the education of students in three areas crucial for                 statistical reasoning:  (1) the conceptual basis for                            statistical reasoning and analysis;  (2) why statistics are a                   necessary part of the research process;  and (3) the impact of                  practical decisions on statistical outcomes.  The laboratory                    will serve ten psychology courses, including Research Methods,                  Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, and eight upper-level                   Topical Research courses.   The learning activities supported                   by the laboratory are based upon Maple, a computer algebra                      system, and SPSSx, a computer statistics package.  Maple will                   help address the first two objectives by creating a dynamic                     learning environment in which abstract statistical concepts are                 represented visually.  SPSSx will help address the third                        objective by providing regular occasions for instructors to                     help students understand how the characteristics of                             psychological research affect the results of statistical                        analyses.",
