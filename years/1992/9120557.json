 "awd_abstract_narration": "To understand how axons of nerve cells navigate in particular                   directions along defined pathways, the substratum for axonal growth             is being examined in the simple system.  Growth of axons can easily             be studied in an insect wing where neurons form a simple, two-                  dimensional network nestled in the space between two monolayers of              epithelial cells.  Transposition of grafts from the upper monolayer             suggests that growing axons are guided in a distal to proximal                  direction by graded cues in their epithelial substratum.  Using                 scanning electron microscopy, the topography of this substratum has             been viewed in its entirety.  Axons encounter an increasing density             of basal cellular processes as they grow proximally.  The                       distribution of surface molecules along the neural pathway can be               modulated by extension and retraction of these basal processes.  A              novel protein (2F5) found on surfaces of the substratum at the time             of axonal outgrowth is thought to be involved in the interaction of             axons with substrata.  This protein has been purified and its                   ability to promote outgrowth of axons will be studied using                     functional assays in situ and scanning electron microscopy.  In                 addition, an immunosuppression technique will be used to generate               antibodies to other surface proteins that may be involved in axonal             pathfinding. These studies promise to identify novel molecules that             play a role in neuronal development and regeneration, not only in               the insect, but in other species, as well.",
