 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focusses on new ways to enhance the teaching of                     Research Methods in Psychology.  This course develops skills in                 critical thinking, applied problem solving, and the ability to                  collect, analyze, and summarize data.  Computers facilitate                     this training by reducing the time required for setting up                      experiments and testing new hypotheses.  A workstation with                     video projection capabilities will enable the instructor to                     present classroom demonstrations as well as step-by-step                        training in the use of software that supports more than 50                      different experiments.  This project is unusually cost-                         effective because the university already provides a laptop                      computer to every student.  The software that students learn                    about in the classroom is installed on their own computers,                     effectively resulting in a private workstation for each student                 This enables the students to design experiments that can be                     conducted in the dormitories, campus centers, or the field.",
