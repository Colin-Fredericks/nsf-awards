Projects in mathematics, physics,                        chemistry, and computer science are all currently being                         supported at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Dickinson                        College, University of Wisconsin, and The University of                         Connecticut, each making significant impact on introductory                     curricula in their respective disciplines.  The purpose of this                 project is to bring together some principal investigators of                    projects funded through these NSF curricular development                        programs and to have them present their experiences at a panel                  at the ASEE Annual Conference in June 1992.                                                                                                                     The American Society for Engineering Education covers the whole                 gamut of engineering disciplines and provides an opportunity                    each summer for many educators to exchange ideas at the ASEE                    Annual Conference.  The panelists will discuss their projects                   in a small presentation and will answer questions from                          attendees at the meeting in order to better acquaint the                        attendees with the type of development and progress that is                     being made in introductory college and university science                       curricula.  It will also present the attendees with a better                    view of the opportunities for support that are provided by the                  NSF programs.",
