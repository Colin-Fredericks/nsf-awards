 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this three year professional development program is to               give 36 teachers (grades 4 through 12) in the Boston MA area the                mathematical and pedagogical background to become teacher-leaders.              Specifically, the proposers have designed a program to explore in               depth and across grade levels, topics relating to algebra--                     beginning with \"pre-algebra\" topics at the elementary and middle                school levels, as well as high school algebra proper. Participating             teachers will study these topics using available, exemplary                     curricular materials, and in the kinds of teaching contexts called              for by the NCTM standards--including cooperative peer learning, use             of hands-on materials, and applications of computers and                        calculators. To these ends, participants will attend eighteen half-             day workshops during the school year, which will take place during              the school day. Local businesses cooperating with the project will              provide substitutes to the schools gratis, using volunteer                      employees who can discuss with students how mathematics is used in              the work place and who, in turn, will gain an appreciation of the               day-to-day problems of the schools. During the summer, the teacher-             participants will continue their studies in an intensive two-week               workshop. This basic format will be repeated in each of the three               years of the program. In the second year, the participating                     teachers will develop and begin to implement new lessons relating               to algebra in their own classrooms. Project staff will provide                  close support and mentoring throughout the year. The lessons                    developed will then be integrated into a coherent 4-12 program of               algebra: \"Algebra for Everyone.\" In the third year, participants                will plan and lead a variety of inservice programs in their schools             and districts to familiarize other teachers with the new materials              and teaching styles. The program will conclude with a dissemination             conference at which the materials, lessons, and experiences of the              program will be made available on a national basis.",
