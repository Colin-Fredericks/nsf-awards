 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal cause of the severe limitations of                           paleointensity data sets is the extreme difficulty of obtaining                 reliable results.  Not only are the measurements time consuming,                but the success rate is relatively low, despite great care in                   sample selection.  One requires, a material possessing a thermal                remanence, that has not altered since its acquisition and does not              alter during the experiments.  Furthermore, the material should                 have cooled at a rate reproducible in the laboratory, and should                be datable with a relative precision of a few percent.  Basaltic                glass has been recovered from hundreds of Deep Sea Drilling Program             holes from anomalies of known age.  Glass is quenched at formation              and the rate of cooling can be well approximated in the laboratory.             It can be inspected for alteration and shown that it does not                   readily alter during the Thellier experiment.  Finally, basaltic                glass derived from MORB appears to contain single domain low-Ti                 magnetite.  Shards can be found that have sufficient moments to be              readily measured with our equipment; such shards obtained from 0                and 2640 year eruptions of the East Pacific Rise have yielded                   excellent paleointensity data and similar quality data can be                   obtained from other basaltic glass regardless of age.  The PI will              carry out a paleointensity study of basaltic glasses.",
