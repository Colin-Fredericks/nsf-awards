 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physiological data suggest that a thermodynamic hierarchy for the               utilization of oxidants could be written for Shewanella                         putrefaciens alone from aerobic growth in the oxic zone to                      thiosulfate reduction at the interface between sulfide-free and                 sulfitic zones of suboxic/anoxic marine basins and porewaters. With             its versatile carbon metabolism and facultative nature, S.                      putrefaciens and organisms like it may well out compete sulfate-                reducing bacteria for the consumption of thiosulfate and other                  sulfur intermediates in marine anoxic basins and sedimentary                    porewaters. These organisms may play a substantial role in the                  control of sulfur speciation in the marine environment. By                      utilizing organic carbon and producing sulfide, these organisms                 would be intimately involved in the poise of the chemocline.                                                                                                    This project will provide new, basic scientific data on the                     molecular genetics of a widespread and very versatile anaerobic-                respiring organism. By isolating and sequencing genes that code for             sulfur reductase, this project will be able to study the regulatory             mechanisms of gene expression. Manipulation of the genes in vivo                will lead to a better understanding of the relationships between                the various sulfur reduction pathways in S. putrefaciens and                    possibly other marine eubacteria. Genetic manipulation could also               aid in comparing the regulation of sulfur reductase activity to                 that of nitrate reductase or Fe reductase in S. putrefaciens. This              work will lead to the collaborative development of a probe for                  nonsulfate-reducing bacteria which utilize sulfur intermediates in              natural sediments. Such a probe along with data on the mechanism of             sulfur intermediate reduction could be used to explore the                      potential contribution of nonsulfate-reducing bacteria such as S.               putrefaciens to the geochemistry of S, Fe, and C in a variety of                suboxic/anoxic marine environments where these sulfur species                   exist.",
