The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit              by Dr. Geoffrey F. Miller to work with Dr. Phil Husbands at the                 University of Sussex.                                                                                                                                           Evolutionary psychology and artificial life research have developed             almost entirely independently, although the failures which they                 sought to correct, in psychology and in Artificial Life, respectively,          stem from the same problem: lack of an evolutionary framework                   for analyzing and synthesizing complex adaptive systems.  Dr.                   Miller's postdoc term will allow him to facilitate dialogue between             these two fields by 1) familiarizing himself with existing                      evolutionary theory, ethology, psychology, and computer science in              Europe, 2) allowing evolutionary psychology principles to be                    disseminated throughout the research groups in Europe, and 3)                   allowing the empirical test of the utility and adequacy of these                principles in real-world applications (i.e. robotics) and in his                continued experimental psychology research.  Since both of these                fields are at early but promising stages of development, their                  intellectual cross-fertilization should be fruitful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a stipend for twelve months.",
