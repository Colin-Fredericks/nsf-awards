 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to identify the insulator surface properties, at              the microscopic level, that control the electron multiplication                 process leading to surface breakdown under electric excitation.                 The surface properties of single crystal (defect free) and                      polycrystalline alumina (99.9% Al2O3) will be systematically                    altered                                                                         by mechanical, thermal, and chemical treatments.  Different                     treatments are intended to modify, in a deliberate and controlled               manner, such surface physical and chemical properties as a                      microdamage, residual stress, surface dielectric constant,                      oxidation state, surface potential, and density of localized                    (defect) levels in the band gap.  Phase I consists of three                     subsections:  (a) Mechanical treatment, (b) Thermal treatment, and              (c) Surface annealing.  Phase II will consist of (d) Chemical                   treatment, and (e) Surface cleaning.                                            %%%%                                                                            This project is a comprehensive study of high voltage flashover                 phenomena, which have high merits in scientific contents.  The                  planned materials variables are based on preliminary work, and can              be expected to yield significant results.  The results can be                   useful to the electrical equipment and electronic industries.  They             should extend the understanding of surface discharge processes, not             only for vacuum gaps but also for general gas insulation problems.",
