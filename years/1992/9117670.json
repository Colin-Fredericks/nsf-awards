 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Gordon Research Conference on the hormone Prolactin will be held              in Casa Sirena Marina Hotel, Oxnard, California on February 3-7,                1992.  This  conference has been ongoing every two years since                  1980, and has been drawing an audience of 110-130 participants.                 These include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and                      academic, government and industrial scientist form the USA and                  abroad who share a common interest in the various aspects of the                hormone.  About half of the participants has attended every                     Prolactin Gordon Conference since it inception.  The participants               including the invited speakers and discussion leaders, are expected             to stay in the meeting for the entire five days duration.                                                                                                       Because of the unique evolutionary aspects of prolactin an its many             biological functions, the conference is of interest to an broad                 range of scientists, from a variety of disciplines.  In accordance              with the long tradition of the Gordon Research Conferences, the                 emphasis is on presentation of recent, unpublished observations,                followed by long and probing discussions.  Such a format fosters                interactions between scientists from different disciplines and                  geographical locations and enables the field to remain progressive              and viable.  There is no other scientific meeting which fulfills                this function.                                                                                                                                                  The conference is consisted of eight scientific sessions, 2-3                   poster sessions, a banquet speaker, a business session, several                 informal meetings of groups with common interests and 2-3 social                functions.",
