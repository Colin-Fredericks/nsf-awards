The conference provides a forum               for interactions between national and international scholars in                 basic and applied research (from engineering, communications and                information science, operations research, economics, law and public             policy) and leaders in communications and information industries,               government policymakers and specialists from public-interest                    organizations.   A major function of the conference is to provide               a forum for the presentation of preliminary studies to alert                    policymakers to new work relevant to their interests and to provide             an opportunity for early critical review by peers.  After revision,             based in part on comments from their TPRC presentation, the papers              are published in professional journals or elsewhere.  All TPRC                  papers are collected and made available upon request from the TPRC              office in Washington, D.C.",
