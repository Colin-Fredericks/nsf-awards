The course, intended for beginning                  crystallographers, will emphasize hands-on experience and will                  lead to an increase the reservoir of crystallographic expertise                 available to the U.S. scientific community.  A set of lecture                   and laboratory notes will be produced and made available to                     chemistry and biology departments that wish to offer a similar                  introductory crystallography course.                                            %%%                                                                             With this award, the Chemistry Division and the Division of                     Instrumentation & Resourses will support a Course for Novice                    Crystallographers proposed by Dr. Bryan M. Craven of the                        Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. The                    course will be offered to beginning crystallographers by the                    American Crystallographic Association.  The notes produced from                 the pilot experimental short course will be made available for                  wide dissemination to chemistry and biology departments.",
