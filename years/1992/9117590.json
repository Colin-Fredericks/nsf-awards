 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science               project between Professor Toshi Tajima, Department of Physics,                  University of Texas, Austin, and Professor Atsushi Ogata, National              Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK), Tsukuba, Japan.  The                  purpose of the project is to investigate and explore novel methods              of particle acceleration via intense lasers experimentally and                  theoretically for future accelerators.  Among the projects to be                explored are the laser wakefield acceleration, ionization front wake,           and plasma resonant cavity.  The salability to higher energies will             be investigated experimentally and theoretically.                                                                                                               The expertise of the U.S. and Japanese groups are complementary.                The U.S. investigators will travel to Tsukuba to coordinate and                 fine-tune their work on computational, theoretical, and laser                   development with the experimental results obtained by the Japanese              group.  The U.S. group has developed a theoretical and                          computational model of wakefield excitation by intense short laser              pulses, while the Japanese group has carried out wakefield                      excitation experiments by a charged particle beam and assembled a               team of experimentalists for a laser wakefield excitation.",
