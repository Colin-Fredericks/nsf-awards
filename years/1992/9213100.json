 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partial support is requested for the purchase of a                              visualization system, consisting of (1) a copper vapor laser                    flash combined with a high speed ICCD camera, and (ii) an                       infrared imaging system. The equipment will greatly improve                     the PI's ability to study the basic mechanisms governing the                    interaction between high powered laser beams and solid                          materials that are being processed (cutting, drilling,                          shaping, welding, joining). A research program studying the                     cutting and shaping of ceramics is under current NSF support,                   but the program suffers from lack of diagnostic equipment. The                                                                                                  requested high speed camera will permit detection and                           quantification of debris in the plume, measurement of                           regression of surface and re-deposition of debris, the onset                    and propagation of cracks and formation and collapse of the                     keyhole. The infrared system will permit the determination of                   temperature maps. Together, the equipment will constitute a                     powerful tool for the study of laser-material interaction                       processes.",
