 "awd_abstract_narration": "Education in the design of very large scale integrated (VLSI)                   digital circuits has reached a stage where undergraduate                        students in U.S. universities are routinely able to                             successfully design sophisticated circuits.  The education of                   this same group of students in analog VLSI design principles is                 not at the same level of maturity due to factors such as the                    extra degrees of freedom involved in the analog design process.                 The increased complexity of analog VLSI design seriously                        interferes with the closure of the design test loop that is an                  important part of the digital VLSI educational process.  This                   project offers a means to provide closure to this design-test                   loop in analog VLSI design by providing educators a laboratory                  style tutorial manual with accompanying VLSI circuit chip set                   that covers many important topics in analog design.  This                       Analog CMOS VLSI Design Resource Kit will allow microsystems                    educators the ability to cover important analog design concepts                 in lecture and then immediately assign laboratory assignments                   based on this material.  The resource kit, including chip set,                  will be designed to be completely accessible via INTERNET.  The                 chip set will be designed so that fabrication may be handled by                 the NSF-supported fabrication service MOSIS.  Dissemination of                  the resource kit will be aided by the Massachusetts                             Microelectronics Center.",
