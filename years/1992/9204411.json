O'Connell of Louisiana State              University and J.T. Lewis of the Dublin Institute of Advanced                   Studies.  The investigators will study stochastic processes in                  quantum systems with special emphasis on systems in quantum                     optics and lasers, atomic and condensed matter physics which                    involve the presence of a heat bath as an integral element.  They               will address the spin-boson problem where a two-level system                    interacts with a radiation field, and problems on blackbody                     radiation heat-bath and dissipative quantum tunneling.  The                     investigators will apply their results and methodology to study the             effects of quantum dissipation in systems that exhibit the                      phenomenon of chaos.  The U.S. group are experts in the                         theoretical aspects of quantum stochastic processes.  The Irish                 investigators bring complementary expertise in the theoretical and              experimental aspects of chaos in semiconductor lasers.                                                                                                          Research in quantum stochastic processes have wide implications                 for a variety of systems in physics.  This research will advance our            understanding of quantum electrodynamics, condensed-matter                      physics, laser physics and atomic physics.",
