Feffer, doctoral candidate; dissertation topic: \"Academic             Science and the German Optical Industry.\"                                                                                                                       With support from this grant, Mr. Feffer is undertaking research in             the company archives of the German firm Jenoptik GmbH.   His study              of technical optics is focusing on several aspects of the rapidly               changing relationship between science and industry during the                   period of the \"second industrial revolution\" -- the time during                 which industries based on technologies of the laboratory (such as               chemicals, pharmaceuticals, optics and electricity) became                      important engines of economic growth.  Jenoptik is the successor to             the optical firm of Carl Zeiss Jena, one of the first makers of                 optical technologies to successfully exploit the possibilities of               scientifically directed research and development, and as such must              be part of any study of the history of modern optical technology.               Because of immanent reorganization, however, the Zeiss company                  archives will be closed to users by the end of this year and will               remain closed for an indefinite period of time.  The next few                   months represents a window of opportunity in which these materials,             located in the former East Germany and for so long virtually                    unavailable to western researchers, may be consulted.",
