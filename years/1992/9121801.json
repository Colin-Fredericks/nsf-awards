 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several companies have produced excellent CCD detectors with low                noise, negligible dark current, and high charge-transfer                        efficiency.  These devices are nearly ideal for astronomical                    observations, with the exception of low overall quantum efficiency              (QE) and small imaging area.  At Steward Observatory a post-                    manufacture CCD optimizing process has been developed with which                commercially produced devices can be thinned for backside                       illumination, backside charging and antireflection coating.  This               procedure has now been demonstrated successfully on several devices             manufactured at the Loral Aeronautronics Corporation.                                                                                                           As a result of this success, we have undertaken a joint program                 with the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO)  to                    custom-design two CCD detector formats for use in astronomical                  spectroscopy.  Eighty-eight of each of these two devices have been              manufactured (at NOAO's expense) with potentially 20% of                        astronomically useful quality.  In this proposal we seek funding                for the thinning, packaging, backside charging, antireflection                  coating, and implementation of several of these devices in the                  spectrographs of the two largest telescopes at the University of                Arizona; the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) on Mt. Hopkins and the             2.3 m telescope on Kitt Peak.  These instruments are workhorse                  facility spectrographs routinely used by faculty, students, and                 visitors, and will benefit greatly by the improved spectral                     coverage, higher efficiency, flatter imaging surface, and lower                 noise of the new detectors.  The MMT spectrograph in particular                 will for the first time have a two-dimensional detector available               for blue and near-UV observations.  This will open entirely new                 classes of observations which can be efficiently made with this                 large aperture telescope.",
