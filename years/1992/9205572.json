 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the research proposed are, a) to provide a better             understanding of the role that interactions between spanning                    segments of a membrane protein play in membrane insertion and                   folding, and b) to help characterize the cellular metabolism of                 mutant membrane proteins.                                                       The studies will use Escherichia coli lac permease as a model to                analzye whether spanning segment interactions contribute to the                 membrane translocation of two of the protein's periplasmic domains.             This analysis will include: a) developing an assay for the                      periplasmic localization of individual domains of unfused lac                   permease. b) the role of interactions in the folding of the                     topological structure (identifying missense changes in part of the              protein (tm9-tm12) that alter folding).                                         This research will also investigate two phenomena involving mutant              membrane proteins.  First, the production of altered membrane                   proteins is commonly toxic to cells, perhaps due to abnormal                    interaction with the membrane itself or the membrane insertion                  apparatus.  Isolating mutants reducing this toxicity will help                  identify its source.  Second, altered membrane proteins are often               rapidly degraded by cellular proteases; Mutant screens can identify             the protease or proteases responsible for this instability.                     %%%                                                                             Cells are surrounded by membranes which protect them from the                   outside environment while allowing inward passage of nutrients.                 Membranes are composed mainly of a combination of lipid and protein             molecules.  The research proposed investigates the mechanisms used              by cells to assemble membranes by examining how proteins are                    inserted into them in the appropriate functional structures.  The               research will analyze mutant forms of one particular membrane                   protein (lactose permease of the bacterium Escherichia coli) which              should show aberrant insertion.  The patterns of altered insertion              should provide insights into the normal membrane assembly process.",
