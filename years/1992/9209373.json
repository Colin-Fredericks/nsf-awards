 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of the tax               system on the international location of business activity and the               employment of productive factors such as labor, capital, and R & D.             Tax effects are analyzed in two contexts.  The first is the                     location, foreign and domestic, of the R & D activities of U.S.                 multinational firms.  Owing to particular aspects of U.S. tax                   changes in the 1980's, the tax law introduced firm-specific                     incentives for some U.S. firms to reduce their domestic R & D                   expenditures and locate some of their R & D activity abroad.  The               research uses the National Science Survey of R & D activities to                investigate the extent to which firms responded to these                        incentives.  The second context is the location decision of foreign             firms doing business in the U.S.  Foreign investors from certain                foreign countries are likely to be insensitive, or at least less                sensitive than other investors to U.S. tax obligations.  Tax rates              vary considerably between states in the U.S.  The study will                    determine the extent to which foreign investors respond to                      differences in state corporate income tax rates, in order to                    identify the features of foreign income tax systems that make                   foreign investors responsive to local tax conditions.",
