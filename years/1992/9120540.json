 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acoustic signals are important in understanding how members of the              same species communicate with each other. Juveniles learn speech                by listening to mature members of their species, and go through an              initial phase of babbling before perfecting this behavior. Human                speech and avian song have many similarities which allow bird song              to be used as a model system for understanding the way in which the             brain regulates communicaton behavior. An important component of                communication is the ability to recognize signals produced by                   members of the same species, called conspecifics. In female birds,              such recognition is essential in insuring that they mate only with              conspecific males. This award to Dr. Eliot Brenowitz will                       investigate how females perceive song and the manner in which brain             regions control recognition of mating songs produced by conspecific             males. Selective inactivation of one brain region, the high vocal               center, causes female birds to fail to distinguish between male                 canary song and the songs of males of other species. To determine               if there is a pathway in the brain that is specialized for song                 recognition, brain regions connected to the high vocal center will              be inactivated. The effects of such inactivation will be measured               with a behavioral display performed by breeding females in response             to presentation of songs sung by conspecific males. Specific                    elements of the song will be tested to determine which signals are              most important. Additionally, each side of the brain will be testd              separately to determine if the system is bilaterally asymmetrical               as is the case for human speech. This work will contribute to                   understanding the way in which the brain controls recognition of                signals critical for successful communication.",
