 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research involves a novel approach for refining metals.                It will utilize the oxygen ion conducting properties of yttria                  stabilized zirconia (YSZ) solid electrolyte to rapidly remove                   oxygen from molten metals and slags.  Typically, one side of the                YSZ electrolyte will be in contact with the melt and the other side             with a reducing gas without letting the gas and the melt come in                direct contact with each other.  This arrangement resembles an                  oxygen concentration cell, and therefore oxygen may be removed by               passing an electric current through the electrolyte.  This can be               accomplished without the application of external potential by                   externally connecting (short circuiting) the electrodes on two                  sides of the electrolyte.  The oxygen flux under this (short                    circuit) condition can be sufficiently high to rapidly deoxidize                (refine) the melt.  In order to efficiently remove oxygen by this               technique, the YSZ electrolyte must be thin, and the electrodes                 must be porous and should cover the entire electrolyte surface for              charge transfer.                                                                     This novel refining device will be constructed and used as                 described above to study the kinetics of oxygen removal from                    copper, low carbon iron and lead oxide-silica melts.  Based on the              study the principal investigator will determine the rate-                       controlling step for oxygen removal in these systems and establish              conditions for efficient refining.  This new process for refining               metals is environmentally sound, can use hydrogen and carbon                    containing reducing gases without running the risk of increasing                hydrogen and carbon content of the melt, and is also rapid.",
