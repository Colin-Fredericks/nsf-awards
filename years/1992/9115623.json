 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in              astrophysics between W. Lothar Frommhold of the University of                   Texas at Austin and Jean-Pierre Bouanich and others at the                      University of Paris (South).  The objective of their research is to             improve understanding of the physics of collision induced                       absorption processes at the fundamental molecular level.  Dr.                   Frommhold is a recognized leader in the theoretical aspects of                  collision induced absorption.  His group in Texas has produced                  computations of absorption spectra of hydrogen molecular pairs.                 This is complemented by the French group's excellent experimental               record in laboratory measurements of collision induced absorption.              The Texas group proposes to compare their theoretical results with              the high quality measurements of the French group.  In the                      process, significant and reliable new data will be obtained.                                                                                                    The project is of major interest to astrophysicists specializing in the         atmosphere of outer planets and cool stars where hydrogen and                   helium are major elements.  The verification of the theoretical                 work in collision induced absorption will advance our                           understanding of the process and its application to star formation in           collapsing clouds.",
