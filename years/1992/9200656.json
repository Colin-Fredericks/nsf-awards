 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator plans to continue research on stochastic                  matching and empirical discrepancy problems in Euclidean and                    general metric spaces.  Current research is directed towards                    understanding the stochastic behavior of matching functionals.                  This involves finding tight non-asymptotic bounds, limiting                     distributions, and exponential type moment bounds.  This would                  add to the understanding of several combinatorial optimization                  problems as well as empirical discrepancy problems, notably                     finding the rate of convergence of the empirical to the true                    distribution.  Results of this type are useful in stochastic                    bin-packing as well as statistical physics.  Concerning                         discrepancy problems in mathematical statistics, research is also               directed towards further enlarging the collection of known                      Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) classes of sets.  This involves                        establishing general connections between VC classes of positivity               sets, quantifier elimination theorems, and semi-algebraic                       geometry.                                                                            The proposed research will focus heavily on the theoretical                and mathematical aspects of the well-known transportation problem               as well as some of its generalizations.  This problem has                       received wide attention over the years and it is recognized that                a full understanding of its mathematical complexities will lead                 to more efficient and perhaps simpler ways to solve optimization                problems ranging from the shipping of goods, to the routing of                  airplanes and the study of statistical mechanics. In its simplest               and most elementary form the problem may be stated as follows.                  Suppose that one is given n oil wells and n refineries and wishes               to efficiently pair off wells and refineries, so as to minimize                 the sum of the matching distances.  It is easy to see that there                are n| different possible matchings.  The transportation problem                is to determine the most efficient matching, i.e., to determine                 that matching which will minimize the sum of the distances. The                 proposed research will consider variations on this and related                  problems.",
