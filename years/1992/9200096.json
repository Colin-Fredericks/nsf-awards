The program will be a 10 week research                    experience in which the interests of the students will be matched               with those of appropriate faculty advisers in the Department.  In               conjunction with the research program, the students will be exposed             to a wide range of research expertise through weekly seminars and               two, overnight field trips.  Additional time will be spent in                   learning elementary statistics, experimental design, slide                      preparation, etc.  During the last two weeks of the research                    period, the students will be joined by their Mentors from the home              institution.  In this way, the students can share their research                experiences with faculty with who they will spend the majority of               their remaining academic career.  These faculty members will be                 able to gain first-hand knowledge of the student's research and,                hopefully, sustain the research momentum during the following                   academic year(s).  The summer's research activities will culminate              in an all day colloquium at which time the students will formally               present the results of their work.  In order to encourage and                   facilitate maximum student-student interaction, they will be                    quartered in one of the University's residential houses throughout              the summer.",
