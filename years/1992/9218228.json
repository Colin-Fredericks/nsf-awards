The                                                  technique involves the formation of                                             clathrate hydrates in                                                           protein-containing solutions with                                               low concentrations of denaturants.                                              Hydrate formation in such solutions                                             opens up the possibility of an                                                  in-situ control of denaturant                                                   concentration by converting part of                                             the aqueous phase to a solid                                                    crystalline form.  The desired                                                  objective is to unfold proteins by                                              forming hydrates and thus                                                       increasing denaturant levels, and                                               subsequently refold these proteins                                              correctly by dissociating hydrates                                              and thus reducing denaturant                                                    levels.  This research is                                                       exploratory in its nature, and is                                               based on a well-known technology                                                directed towards a completely new                                               application.",
