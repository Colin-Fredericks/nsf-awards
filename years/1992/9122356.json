 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will continue on ionic organic reactions and their                     intermediates with emphasis on the role of electrophilic                        (proto) solvation in activating onium ions, carboxonium ions                    and certain carbocationic systems by interaction with the                       available non-bonded electron pairs of the heteroatoms.  Some                   potential oxonium and carboxonium dications will be studied                     such as diprotonated alcohols, diprotonated CO, diprotonated                    HCN and diprotonated CO2 as well as diprotonated esters.                        Included will be experimental superacidic investigations based                  on isotopic exchange studies, as well as low temperature                        spectroscopic investigations and theoretical studies.  The                      protolytic (alkylative) chemistry will also be studied.  The                    protolytic (coordinative) activation of the Friedel-Crafts                      reaction will be explored in reactions of alkanes, as well as                   highly deactivated aromatics.  Halooxonium ions and mixed                       halo-alkyl derivatives will be also prepared and studied in                     chlorination reactions.  Polyhalonium dications  will be                        explored, as will be bora-cations.  The search for persistent                   silicenium ions will be continued, including solid state 29Si                   NMR studies.  The recently discovered derivatization of C60 and                 C70 fullerenes will be followed up including halogenation,                      alkylation, acyclation and other reactions.                                     %%%                                                                             With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                 research of Dr. George A. Olah at the Univeristy of Southern                    California.  The research will explore the generation of                        diprotonated species formed by the interaction of a proton with                 the unshared electron pairs on oxygen and nitrogen atoms in                     stable molecular species.  The chemistry of these reactive                      species will be studied.  This will result in the development                   of some new unique synthetic methodology that should benefit                    research in biochemistry and medicine as well as in the                         chemical industry.",
