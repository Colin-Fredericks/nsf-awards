 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop statistical                   tests for some important properties of stationary spatial random                fields.  The properties to be considered are those of direction-                invariance (isotropy) and separability, and variations thereof,                 of the second-order variation.  In addition to having important                 scientific meaning in many situations, these properties, when                   they hold, can greatly simplify both the computations involved                  in, and conclusions made from, the analysis of spatial data.                    Parametric testing approaches, which are based on a parametric                  model for the semivariogram or covariance function, and                         nonparametric approaches, which utilize method-of-moments                       estimators for sempiparametric approach will also receive                       attention.  Biological environmental, and physical scientists who               analyze spatial data will find the testing procedures useful.
