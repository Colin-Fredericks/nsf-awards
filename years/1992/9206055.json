 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Basin and RAnge contains one of the Cordillera's              most important and enigmatic Cenozoic tectonic regimes - the highly             extended terrane consisting of a series of metamorphic core                     complexes and detachment fault structures along the southwestern                margin of the Colorado Plateau.  This terrane, a 25,000 km2 region              known as the Whipple domain constitutes the largest tilt-block                  domain within the Southern Basin and Range and is characterized by              west-tilted fault blocks and east- to northeast-dipping normal                  faults.  This is a project to delineate, in three dimensions, the               structural elements of t he Whipple domain and its a boundaries.                This study will pay particular attention to subsurface tectonic                 configurations and spatial relationships as provided by seismic                 reflection profiles and will be \"ground-truthed\" by field                       observations.  The seismic data base consists of 27 generally high-             quality proprietary industry seismic reflection profiles (1400 km)              line length) which are already resident at USC or for which we have             received permission to obtain.  These data will greatly expand upon             the results of earlier CALCRUST work in the Whipple Mountains, and              the portions of the COCORP and PACE transects which pass through                the Whipple domain.  The Whipple domain probably represents the                 most complete and contiguous overall exposure of the various                    structural elements of the Cordilleran highly extended terrane.",
