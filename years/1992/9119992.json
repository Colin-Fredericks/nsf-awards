 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                      Organometallic Program, is for continuation of studies of the                   factors that affect long-range electron transfer in biological                  systems.  Genetically engineered mutants of yeast                               iso-1-cytochrome c, which  have histidine residues substituted                  for the native amino acid at various sites on the periphery of                  the protein, will be used for these studies.  Introduction of                   redox active, luminescent ruthenium complexes, by complexation                  at these histidine sites, allows for the spectroscopic                          monitoring of electron-transfer to, or from, the metalloenzyme                  over well-known, fixed distances.  A recently developed laser                   flash-quench technique will be used to determine the                            electron-transfer rates.  This technique has two major                          advantages for these studies over previous methods.  First, it                  allows for study of the protein with the native iron, rather                    than a metal substituted version, and second, it permits the                    study of a much wider range of transfer rates.  In a second                     phase of the research, similarly modified human myoglobins will                 be used for the study of the coupling of single electron                        transfers to multielectron events such as generation of a                       ferryl (Fe=O) species.  The overall objective of these studies                  is to determine the mechanism by which the electron moves from                  the donor to the acceptor over distances of 10 angstroms and                    greater.                                                                        %%%                                                                             Electron transfer is one of the most important processes in                     biological systems.  An intriguing aspects of these electron                    transfers is that the electron donor and acceptor are                           frequently separated by large distances.  Whereas theories of                   electron transfer over short distances, where overlap of donor                  and acceptor orbitals can occur, is well developed, the                         mechanism by which the electron moves over long distances is                    not well understood.  Studies such as these may ultimately                      result in better treatment of certain physiological disorders                   and in new methods of solar energy conversion.",
