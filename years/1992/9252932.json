 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project deals with various problems of                             analysis and design of control systems subject to                               parametric uncertainty.  Specifically we consider                               interval systems whose transfer function coefficients                           are linear or multilinear functions of the parameters                           subject to perturbation.  The main goals of this project                        are 1) to develop effective methodologies to design                             controllers that perform satisfactorily under large                             amounts of parametric uncertainties and 2) to expand                            understanding of time and frequency domain properties of                        various types of control systems.  The project consists                         of two parts:  development of new theory and its                                implementation as a computer aided design software                              package.  The theoretical problems we propose to solve                          are as follows:                                                                 1) Reexamining the classical control design and analysis                        techniques with robustness ingredients and developing                           new design methodologies for robust parametric control                          design.                                                                         2) Developing relevant theory for time delay systems.                           This includes what is a necessary and sufficient                                condition to determine robust stability of a time delay                         interval system with a fixed controller, how to                                 computationally check the robust stability, what are the                        frequency and time domain characteristics of a time                             delay interval system, and how to adjust selective                              parameters within their intervals to improve the system                         performance.                                                                    3) Developing equivalent theory and computational                               algorithms to deal with multilinear interval systems.                           4) Developing theory to examine the time domain                                 properties of interval systems and its use in                                   controlling transient response.                                                 5) Developing a new modeling and identification                                 technique to determine an interval system from the given                        input - output test data and the nominal linear                                 identified model.                                                               The second part of the project is to build an efficient                         computer aided design software to incorporate all the                           above design methods.  The base system of this software                         is MATLAB.  We expect it will be a valuable tool for                            robust parametric control design and analysis for both                          theoreticians and practicing engineers.",
