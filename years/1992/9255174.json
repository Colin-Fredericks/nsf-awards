 "awd_abstract_narration": "This document proposes the development of a permanent Summer                    Institute in the Department of Information and Computer Science at              the University of California, Irvine.  The main objective of this               Institute will be to increase the participation of underrepresented             minority students in Computer Science.  The Institute, which is                 based on a pilot project organized for the Summer of 1992, will                 target specifically students at 2 year institutions and encourage               them to continue their Computer Science education at a 4-year                   institution, such as UCI.                                                                                                                                       The Institute will offer a comprehensive 6-week program consisting              of the following major components:  (1) a set of three courses - an             introductory computer science course, a study skills course, and a              career development curse; (2) a corporate internship with one of                Southern California's major computer-related firms; a variety of                inter-and cross-cultural experiences, structured into three main                chapters of the Institute - Native American, African American, and              Chicano/Latino Chapters.  The target population will be 60 students             each year Chapter.                                                                                                                                              The Institute will be co-sponsored by the ICS Department, the                   Corporate partners, and the UCI-based CAMP project.  The Institute              will complement the broad overall objectives of CAMP by providing               a focused and highly-structured program for the Computer Science                discipline.",
