 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is based upon the hypothesis that the expression of               pigmentation patterns of vertebrates from primitive fishes to man               is determined by the presence of intrinsic inhibiting and/or                    stimulating factors present in the skin. It is considered that                  these factors work in concert with other agents, viz. hormones such             as melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), to either inhibit or                   stimulate the development and maintenance of the circumscribed                  pigment cells of vertebrates. These include the black or brown                  melanophores, the yellow to red xanthophores, and the iridescent                iridophores. All three pigment cell types are derived from the                  cadre of the neural crest cells that migrate from atop the neural               tube to the skin. Presumably, after these prospective pigment cells             arrive at their destinations, they are exposed to the localized                 putative melanization inhibiting factors (MIF) and melanization                 stimulating factors (MSF) which affect pigment cell development.                The activities of these factors, both individually and in                       combination, on various aspects of amphibian pigment cell                       expression will be tested in vivo and in vitro. Both biological and             biochemical characterization of the putative MIF and MSF will be                undertaken and antibodies raised to these molecule will be utilized             as probes to further study the distribution and activities of these             factors. This information should provide insight into our                       understanding of the mechanisms of pigment pattern formation and                maintenance. These patterns include the dorsal ventral pigmentation             patterns commonly found in most vertebrates as well as the                      individual spots and stripes that are also seen frequently.",
