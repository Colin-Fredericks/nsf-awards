 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to study gene transfer among marine               microbial communities through the application of molecular                      techniques that avoid the selective process of isolation and                    cultivation.  Since genetic material can be transferred to                      receptive hosts without gene expression, this study will be                     designed to detect the presence of marker gene sequences                        transferred by phage transduction to recipient microbial hosts and              complemented with studies designed to determine the frequency of                subsequent gene expression of the marker sequences in recipient                 hosts.  Biotintylated probes have been developed for visualizing                the presence of viral sequences in virus-infected cells and,                    because of its sensitivity and specificity, is the most appropriate             approach for tracking specific gene sequences in native microbial               communities.  This methodology will be applied to the study of                  plasmid DNA transduction by a generalized transducing vibriophage.              The ecologically important role of particulate organic matter on                the growth rate of the donor host, vibriophages, gene recipient                 hosts, phage/host encounter rates, bacteriophage survival and gene              transduction frequency will be investigated.  The results of these              studies on gene transduction in vibriophages isolated from the                  marine environment will serve as a model for gene transfer in                   marine microorganisms and indicate the potential importance of gene             transfer in native marine microbial communities.",
