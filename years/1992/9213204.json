 "awd_abstract_narration": "The brain, spinal cord and nerves are made up of individual cells               including the type called nerve cells or neurons.  For the nervous              system to function, neurons have to communicate with each other and             with the cells they control such as muscle cells.  The most                     important type of communication is via secretion of chemical                    messengers called neurotransmitters which can excite or inhibit                 other cells.  Most secretion of neurotransmitters requires that                 calcium, which is present in the fluid which surrounds cells, enter             the neuron at a site just prior to secretion.  This calcium enters              the neuron through structures called channels.  Since neurons have              many kinds of calcium channels, and since many substances in                    the nervous systems can control neurotransmitter secretion by                   affecting calcium channels, it is important to know which types of              calcium channels directly affect or are coupled to transmitter                  secretion.  It is also known that cells around the neuron can                   affect which channels are coupled to secretion at different times               of development.  Dr. Gray will study the relationship between                   specific types of calcium channels and the secretion of the                     neurotransmitter acetylcholine in neurons during development, using             direct measurement of release of radioactively-labeled                          acetylcholine and electrical recording of calcium influx through                channels.  The mechanism by which cells such as muscle cells affect             coupling between these types of channels and acetylcholine                      secretion will also be studied.  The control of secretion at                    synaptic sites in the nervous system is of fundamental importance               to the understanding of brain function.***//",
