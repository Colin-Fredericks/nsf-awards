 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports cooperative study by a team                 of Myanmar geologists and geophysicists headed by U. Tin Myint of               the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, and a team of U.S. scientists               headed by Dr. Michael Fuller of the University of California,                   Santa Barbara.  The study will be a paleomagnetic effort to help                establish the tectonic history of that country.  Paleomagnetism                 is a suitable way for documenting the effects of the Indian-Asia                collision and also contributes to the understanding of the                      accretionary processes, whereby Myanmar became a part of Asia.                  This work will complement studies being carried out under NSF/EAR               grant.                                                                                                                                                          Scope:  This research will benefit greatly from participation of                scientists from Myanmar who have access to data, and to field                   facilities that would not be easily available, independently, to                foreign scientists.  The visits of the Myanmar scientists to the                laboratory at U.C. Santa Barbara will help break a near total                   isolation from the west, and enhance the potential for future                   collaboration with that country.  The project meets the                         objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program.",
