 "awd_abstract_narration": "Having prestige has important consequences because                         successful claims to esteem often justify access to privileges,                 yet the concept of prestige has been neglected in empirical                     studies of social stratification.  This doctoral dissertation                   project will study the processes of classification and aesthetic                evaluation among popular music artists in Quebec, empirically                   testing the hypothesis that aesthetic judgment and artistic                     classifications define boundaries between people and function as                mechanisms for permitting and prohibiting access to material and                symbolic rewards.  It will analyze how music and musicians are                  classified into categories, which criteria are used in doing so,                and how prestige and artistic value are allocated among artists.                Interviews will be conducted, and multidimensional scaling                      techniques will be used to determine to what extent the processes               of artistic classification and evaluation reflect the more                      general processes of social stratification between people sharing               a similar position in society and in the music industry.                                                                                                             This project will contribute to the advancement of                         sociological knowledge by using techniques developed in studies                 of occupational prestige to create linkages between two subfields               of sociology, the sociology of culture and stratification.  This                project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a                        promising young scholar to continue to develop independent                      research skills.",
