 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cadmium is electroplated in cyanide baths in 1,166 facilities              across the United States.  During the past two decades,                         considerable research has been conducted to reduce toxic chemical               discharge from cadmium electroplating operations.  However,                     economical elimination of cadmium discharge or sludge has not been              reported.  To address the environmental issues related to cadmium               electroplating, a novel plasma enhanced vapor deposition concept                was developed in the laboratory.  In addition to high deposition                rates for cadmium and zinc, the feasibility of in-situ cadmium                  reclamation to eliminate toxic chemical discharge was demonstrated.             It is also feasible to extend this concept to deposit or reclaim                zinc-cadmium alloys.  However, an understanding of the effect of                process variables on the deposition rate and properties of cadmium              is required.                                                                         A systematic research using statistical experimental design                methods will develop this understanding.  The research could lead               to an environmentally acceptable cadmium vapor plating process (Dry             Plating) as an alternative to cyanide electroplating.",
