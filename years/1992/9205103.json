The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit              by Dr. R. Jay Pulliam of the University of California, Berkeley to              the University of Utrecht to work with Dr. Roel Snieder.  Their                 proposed research is in two parts.  First, in the context of                    traditional \"model-based\"imaging techniques, they propose to                    incorporate the most accurate and extensive information that exists             in order to perform a joint 3-D nonlinear tomographic inversion for             the Tonga subduction zone.  They will use multiple P and S phases               to determine both P and S velocities beneath the Tonga subduction               zone in an effort to constrain the maximum depth to which velocity              anomolies associated with the subducted lithosphere extend into the             mantle.  The inversion algorithm and data coverage would be                     explored in conjunction with controlled inversions of synthetic data            produced with real ray coverage.                                                                                                                                However, \"model-based\" approaches to seismic imaging do not                     allow the rigorous testing of geophysical hypotheses.  Statistical              techniques  must be developed.  The second part of the research is              directed toward developing methods which will provide them with                 uncertainty information about heterogeneities imaged by nonlinear               travel time tomography.  The results will allow them to make                    statistically-sound inferences about Earth structure and therefore to           address more rigorously important questions regarding the fate of               subducted lithosphere:  whether slabs commonly extend through the               670 km discontinuity, whether they become detached from slabs at                the surface and, ultimately, whether the upper and lower mantle are             mixed together.                                                                                                                                                 The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a stipend for twelve months.",
