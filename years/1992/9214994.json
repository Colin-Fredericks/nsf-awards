 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of the extent of charge development in the                     reactions of substituted N-phenylhydroxylamines with methyl and                 benzylarenesulfonates will be conducted.  The extent of charge                  development in the transition state will be evaluated by                        measuring reaction rates as a function of free energy                           parameters for both the nucleophile (N-phenylhydroxylamines)                    and the substrate (arenesulfonates).  Kinetic isotope effects                   will be used to provide details about the extent of bonding in                  the transition state.  The degree of charge development in the                  transition state derived experimentally will be compared with                   results from semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations.                     The study will combine electrochemical and spectroscopic                        techniques with molecular orbital calculations and kinetic                      isotope measurements to determine the role that solvent and                     substrate type play in defining the role of N-hydroxyl groups                   on nucleophilic substitution reactions of amines.                               %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports an                        investigation of nucleophilic reactions between                                 N-hydroxylamines and arenesulfonates by Professor K. R.                         Fountain at Northeast Missouri State University.  The                           investigation will focus on the unusual effect that certain                     hydroxy groups have on the rate of chemical reactions involving                 amines.  A particularly important feature of this work will be                  an involvement of undergraduate chemistry majors in a research                  project combining spectroscopic and electrochemical laboratory                  measurements with theoretical calculations on a computer.  By                   simulating the reactions on a computer, and comparing the                       results with the experimental data, it will be possible to                      delineate the degree to which transfer of an electron between                   the interacting chemical species accelerates the overall rate                   of the nucleophilic reactions being studied.",
