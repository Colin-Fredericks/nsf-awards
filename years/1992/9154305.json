 "awd_abstract_narration": "MIT is conducting a two-week summer workshop for college and                    university physics faculty to exchange ideas and designs for                    advanced pedagogical experiments in modern physics and to study                 the experiments currently in use in the MIT Junior Physics                      Laboratory (the third-year course in experimental physics                       required for MIT physics majors) for the purpose of evaluating                  them for possible reproduction and use in similar courses at                    their home institutions. The MIT Junior Lab experiments are                     designed for students who have completed an introductory course                 in modern physics and are taking concurrently an introductory                   course in quantum mechanics.  The experiments provide hands-on                  experience with the phenomena of particle, nuclear, atomic,                     condensed matter, statistical, and astro-physics.  The summer                   workshop will assist in the national effort to improve the                      quality of undergraduate physics education.  This project                       responds to a suggestion, put forward at the Santa Fe Workshop                  on Undergraduate Curriculum Development (June 1-3, 1990), that                  universities with excellent advanced undergraduate laboratory                   courses should organize summer workshops like the current one.",
