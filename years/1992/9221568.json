 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Research of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care             Program proposes to connect its local area network to the NSFNET                for the purpose of facilitating its research activities.  DOR is                applying to the National Science Foundation for a grant to share                the cost of hardware, software and communication services to                    connect its Ethernet local area network to NSFNET, under the                    \"Connections to NSFNET\" program through an interagency agreement                with the National Library of Medicine.  A connection to NSFNET                  would allow communication between over 150 DOR researchers and                  colleagues in the academic community, at other medical research                 institutions and in government agencies, who already have Internet              connectivity.  It would facilitate the transfer of data, documents              and ideas between researchers at DOR and other institutions who are             working on collaborative projects and multicenter research studies.                                                                                             It would also provide collaborative projects and multicenter                    research studies.  It would also provide DOR investigators with                 access to national networks and services and improve access to                  services which are currently limited by 2400 baud modem                         connections.                                                                                                                                                         To gain access to NSFNET, DOR proposes to connect its LAN to               the Bay Area Regional Research Network (BARRNet), a regional data               network connected to NSFNET, using a leased line between DOR and a              port on the BARRNet backbone at the University of California,                   Berkeley.",
