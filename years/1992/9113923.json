 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Bulgaria research project in chemistry                                is between Dr. D.M. Roundhill of Tulane                                         University and Dr. K. Troev of the Central                                      Laboratory for Polymers, Sofia.  The researchers'                               previous collaboration has shown that the                                       reaction of dialkyl phosphonates (RO)2PHO, with                                 either amines or metal chlorides results in                                     dealkylation of the phosponate, and the formation                               of an alkylammonium or metal ion in salt of the                                 monoalkyl phosponate anion (RO)PHO2.  This                                      project will synthesize new alkyl phosponate                                    anions for use as plant growth inhibitors and as                                catalysts for the synthesis of flame retardant                                  polymers.  By alkyl group transfer to an amine                                  functionality, lipophilic monoalkyl phosphonate                                 anions can be incorporated into a water-soluble                                 VP-VA copolymer.  The researchers will synthesize                               R4N\u0131(RO)PHO2! and of complexes                                                  M(O2HP(OR))6(M=Co,Ni,Pd,Pt,Ru,Fe).  They propose                                to investigate whether these salts and complexes                                act as catalysts for the addition of dialkyl                                    phosphonates to aledhydes or ketones (Abramov                                   reaction), and alkense.  The products will be                                   tested for use as agricultural chemicals and as                                 polymeric materials.                                                                                                                                            This project in chemistry fulfills the program                                  objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                                  enabling leading experts in the United States and                               Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents                                 and pool resources in areas of strong mutual                                    interest and competence.",
