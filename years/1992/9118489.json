 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports two marine geological cruises to the fjords                 and continental shelf of southern Chile.  Research will                         concentrate on the collection and analysis of single channel                    seismic reflection data, 3.5 KHz profiler data, and piston cores.               This work will examine fundamental questions concerning the                     dynamics of the Patagonian ice sheet during the late Wisconsin                  glaciation and how it responded to changing marine and                          terrestrial climate during the last glacial/interglacial                        transition.                                                                                                                                                     This project represents an extension of current investigations                  into the marine geology of the Antarctic Peninsula to include                   glacial marine environments from a wider latitudinal range.  In                 order to enhance the applicability of litho-and                                 seismo-stratigraphic studies to a broader range of Quaternary                   science, this research will be conducted in cooperation with                    other researchers investigating marine and terrestrial                          paleoclimate.   Down core changes in micro-flora (diatoms) and                  micro-fauna will be examined in conjunction with geochemical and                isotopic analyses.  Palynological studies of some cores will be                 undertaken in an attempt to refine our misunderstanding of the                  relationship between terrestrial and marine paleoclimates.  The                 project will also be undertaken in cooperation with Chilean                     researchers who are interested in the sedimentary and tectonic                  history of the region.  By extending the marine studies of the                  Antarctic Peninsula to Patagonia, and by broadening their scope                 to include land-sea correlations, valuable insight will be gained               into spatial and temporal changes on climate along a broad range                of latitudes.",
