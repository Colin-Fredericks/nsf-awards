 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sellers is exploring the growing concern about occupational                 chemical hazards in the United States.  His study concentrates on               the origins of this concern in the period from 1900-1930 when a new             community of experts arose to address this problem.  Dr. Sellers is             examining the technological, economic and social changes                        influencing the rise of this new community of experts and role they             came to play.  He is focusing on:  the changing rates of                        occupational poisonings in this period and their roots in                       technological change; the evolving attitude of corporate                        representatives toward this problem and their responsibility for                fostering the new expertise; and the new experts' shifting                      relations with workers, the emerging compensation system for                    occupational disease, and the more established profession of                    engineering.  As part of his professional development fellowship,               Dr. Sellers is working at Johns Hopkins University with the                     economic historian, Professor Louis Galambos, and the historian of              technology, Dr. Stuart Leslie who are providing training in their               specialties and are helping to guide his research.  Dr. Sellers                 goal is to analyze the origins of the new science in workplace                  change and in scientific professionals' efforts to establish an                 autonomous role for themselves with a corporate and technology-                 driven economy.  This work will elucidate the importance of this                science in environmental history and in the emergence of modern                 \"organizational society.\"",
