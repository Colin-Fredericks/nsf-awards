 "awd_abstract_narration": "New \"engineered\" thermoplastics are polymer-polymer blends                      which have a high modulus, good toughness, and high softening                                                                                                   temperatures.  They can therefore be used in designed                           structures which typically require metals.  Other polymer                       blends have special properties that permit them to be used for                                                                                                  particular applications.  Most blends are made by mixing two                    or more immiscible polymers in the molten state.  Their                         multiphase structure must be stabilized to prevent coalescence                                                                                                  when the blend is extruded or molded by a polymer processor.                                                                                                    The main method for compatibilization is to use a block                         copolymer which can act like a polymeric soap to stabilize the                                                                                                  morphology.  This block copolymer can be premade and                            compounded into the mixture or it can be formed in situ by                      coupling reactions between the two different chains.                                                                                                            A research program is planned to understand and control the                     morphology which develops during melt mixing.  Two model pairs                                                                                                  of immiscible polymers, polystyrene (PS) and poly(2-                            vinylpyridine) PVP, and linear low density polyethylene (LLPE)                                                                                                  and poly(ethylene-co-polypropylene) PEP will be used as test                    materials.  The LLDPE/PEP system offers unique opportunities                    since it can be made miscible at elevated temperatures.                         Morphologies created by precipitation from the miscible melts                                                                                                   will be compared by mixing immiscible melts and by reactive                     coupling.  New and useful morphologies should result from this                                                                                                  research as well as strategies and quantitative models for                      efficient compatibilization of polymer blends.",
