Mupun is a West Chadic language, spoken in the Plataeu                  State of Nigeria.  The Grammar and an accompanying Dictionary are               the first full descriptions of this language and also the most                  complete body of information on any language from the Angas                     group, to which Mupun belongs.  The two books were written with                 the support of an NSF grant.  The dictionary received a Kayden                  Prize in the Humanities, an award that provides support for the                 publication of the book.  The Grammar presents a number of                      analyses and facts of interest for general linguistics.  In                     addition, observation in the field indicates that the language is               in extremely vulnerable situation because the educated youth are                more and more replacing Mupun in their daily speech by eith Hausa               or English.  The Grammar and the Dictionary will be thus the                    record of a language in jeopardy of extinction within a few                     generations.",
