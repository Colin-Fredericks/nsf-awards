 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an NSF Young Investigator award.  Research covers two                   distinct areas of heterogeneous catalysis:  solid bases and                     quantum-sized photocatalysts.                                                                                                                                   The solid bases of interest are primarily metal oxides and                      mixed metal oxides with surface areas in excess of 200 square                   meters per gram.  These are studied in both supported and                       unsupported form to examine the influence of carrier structure                  on reactivity.  Zeolite-occluded oxides are also under study.                   The overall aim is to understand how the oxide surface                          structure stabilizes anionic intermediates during a catalytic                   cycle; the approach is to correlate catalyst synthesis with                     atomic structure, adsorption, and chemical reactivity.                          Principal techniques used are Fourier-transform infrared                        spectroscopy of surface intermediates, temperature-programmed                   desorption and reaction of probe molecules, and steady-state                    reaction studies, including isotopic labelling.                                                                                                                 Nanometer-sized semiconductor clusters exhibit unusually high                   quantum efficiencies for photocatalytic activity compared to                    bulk-phase material.  Exploratory studies with supported                        titania and other photocatalysts are performed with the goal                    of creating a selective hydrocarbon  oxidation catalyst by                      incorporating the photoactive material onto a carrier capable                   of molecular discrimination and orientation.  Zeolites and                      related materials are suitable candidates for such a carrier.                   Materials are characterized by laser Raman spectroscopy,                        ultraviolet diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray                         absorption spectroscopy.  Adsorption studies and steady-state                   photocatalytic oxidation reactions are used to probe the                        surface reactivity of these novel materials.//",
