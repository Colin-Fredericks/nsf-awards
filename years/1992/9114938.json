 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Peter Connors is the Reserve Manager of the Bodega                     Marine Laboratory, which is operated by the University of                       California at Davis and is a part of the University of California               Reserve System.  Dr. Connors proposes construction of a research                greenhouse, to be dedicated to research on terrestrial plants and               plant/insect interactions of the coastal terrace.  Two small                    temporary greenhouses have been used by visiting investigators                  but the projected needs will soon saturate the space available.                 In addition, a recently hired faculty member has an active                      research program that requires greenhouse space.                                     The greenhouse planned for the Bodega Marine Laboratory is a               creative expansion of the Lab's research impact.  The greenhouse                will attract an increasing number of visiting scientists and                    students, and will broaden the range of natural phenomena studied               at the Lab.  The resulting studies of coastal plants and their                  associated insects will provide important new insights into the                 ecology and management of the ocean margin zone.",
