 "awd_abstract_narration": "Poly-B-hydroxyalkanoates (PHA's), polymers found in many bacteria,              have attracted considerable interest in recent years because they               exhibit biodegradable thermoplastic properties.  The physical                   properties of PHA polymers are dictated by the number of carbons in             their monomeric unit.  For instance, poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate                  (PHB= C4 monomeric unit) is much more flexible.  For this reason,               there is considerable ongoing research in the development of the                PHB/V copolymer.  The bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus is one of the             first bacteria shown to be capable of producing either PHB or                   PHB/V, depending on the feedstock.  The genes for polymer synthesis             in A. euthrophus have been cloned into Escherichia coli by our                  research group  where we have employed them to produce large                    intracellular deposits of PHB.  In initial experiments using                    standard E. coli strains we have not been able to detect copolymer              synthesis, even when the feedstock is altered to stimulate PHB/V                synthesis.  However, recently we were able to obtain copolymer                  synthesis employing an E. coli mutant.  Preliminary results                     indicate that copolymer synthesis in E. coli is similar to that                 found in A. eutrophus.  The purpose of this research is to further              develop our knowledge of PHB/V synthesis and PHB/V genetics using               the newly develop E. coli system.  This research will be done by                conducting a comprehensive survey of bacteria that produce                      primarily PHB and PHB/V, cloning of selected PHB/V genetic                      pathways, analysis of these pathways in E. coli capable of PHV                  production, and manipulation of copolymer synthesis and structure               using genetic techniques.",
