 "awd_abstract_narration": "Identifying the way in which information is transferred from one                nerve cell to another in the spinal cord is important to                        understanding how the spinal cord functions to produce normal motor             behavior. Information conveyed by a neuron is encoded in the rate               and pattern of action potentials, or \"spikes\" transmitted along its             axon. While one neuron's average rate of firing has clear effects               on the firing of other neurons that it contacts through chemical                connections called synapses, there is little experimental evidence              as to what details of firing pattern may be transmitted from one                neuron to another, especially for synapses that have small                      individual effects. That evidence will be provided by the research              to be done under this award to Drs. Timothy Cope and Brian Clark.               The work will use the synapse of type Ia muscle spindle sensory                 neurons onto spinal motoneurons, which is part of the familiar                  stretch reflex circuitry. In addition, this work will yield                     important new information on how multiple sensory neurons interact              when their firing becomes partially synchronized, a situation that              appears to typify the action of stretch-sensitive sensory neurons               during dynamic changes of muscular length. The results of this                  research will be significant in two ways: first, it will reveal                 what features of the spike trains of sensory neurons are actually               important for the control of muscles and movements; and second, it              will detail the influence between neurons that have a relatively                weak synaptic connection, thus shedding light on the mode of                    information transfer across synapses. This basic research will                  contribute to understanding the way in which the central nervous                controls movement.",
