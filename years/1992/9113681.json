 "awd_abstract_narration": "The P.I. plans to conduct field studies focused on (a) the                 biosphere-atmosphere exchange of carbonyl sulfide (COS) and                     carbon disulfide (CS2) over continental areas, and (b) the                      photochemical oxidation of dimethylsulfide (CH2SCH3, DMS) in the                marine troposphere.  Both processes are important components of                 the biogeochemical sulfur cycle with potentially large                          implications for global climate regulation.  Exchange rates of                  COS, CS2, and carbon dioxide (CO2) between plants (and soils) and               the atmosphere will be measured on a diurnal and seasonal basis                 in different natural environments including a loblolly pine                     forest, an oak-hickory forest, and different agricultural biomes                with various types of crops (wheat, corn, soybeans, sorghum).  A                combination of different methods will be used including the                     gradient flux technique and enclosure chambers (using ambient air               or sulfur-spiked zero air as sweep gas).  Studies of the chemical               transformation of DMS over coastal and open ocean waters will                   also be made on a diurnal and seasonal basis.  A major part of                  this program will consist of collaborative measurements involving               new, highly sensitive techniques for continuous real-time                       detection of DMS, major oxidants such as the hydroxy (OH) and                   hydroperoxy radicals (HO2), and the major DMS oxidation products                dimethysulfoxide (DMSO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and gas phase                    methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and sulfuric acid.  The goal is to                   enhance our understanding of the atmospheric cycles of COS, CS2,                and DMS, in response to biological and meteorological factors.",
