The participants, four three-member teams from                each of four area school districts and one three-member team from               the private schools, will be selected from teachers who have                    participated in an existing program in dynamical modeling at                    Georgetown University.  The participants will meet several times                during the first school year further develop, implement and monitor             progress of results from the dynamical modeling project.  They will             then attend a two-week summer leadership training workshop to                   develop an in-depth inservice course to be team-taught to other                 teachers in their school system in the succeeding two years.                    During the intervening summer, participants and PI's will attend a              one-week evaluation seminar.  Four follow-up seminars will be held              during each of the two academic years to monitor progress of the                inservice courses.                                                                                                                                              Cost sharing by the university and the schools constitutes 27% of               the award.",
