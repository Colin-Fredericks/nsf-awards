The project involves the                 formation of a coalition composed of two four-year                              institutions, the University of Texas at Austin and Georgia                     Institute of Technology, and a larger number of two-year                        institutions in the Gulf and South-Atlantic states.  In                         addition, six leading educators, one from each state of the                     coalition region, will consult to provide  local input to the                   program.  A total of 48 faculty members from approximately 40                   two-year institutions will benefit directly from this project                   and through them several thousand students each year. Of that                   number 23% of the students are expected to be minorities and                    28% will transfer to four-year engineering colleges to complete                 their B.S. degree.***//",
