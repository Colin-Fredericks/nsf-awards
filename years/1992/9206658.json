 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this research is to determine the molecular               mechanism of muscular contraction. In this proposal we hope to                  provide direct evidence for the \"rotating myosin head\" hypothesis               of Huxley (1969), the widely accepted working model for the                     contractile mechanism. Our approach is to correlate the structural              changes of the myosin head (orientation and mobility) with force                production (mechanical cycle) and the utilization of ATP                        (biochemical cycle). In order to delineate physical changes taking              place during different steps of the contractile cycle, steady-                  state equilibria will be perturbed mechanically and biochemically               including \"trapping\" the cycle at certain steps.                                                                                                                The orientation and mobility of muscle proteins will be measured                using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) following              the labeling of these proteins with paramagnetic probes. EPR is                 uniquely suited for this purpose because it is site-specific and                it is sensitive  to static orientation and rotational mobility of               proteins.                                                                                                                                                       We have just developed a number of computational methods to extract             the myosin head orientation (rather than the spin probe                         orientation) from EPR spectra. This new technology will give a                  detailed (3 degree resolution) picture of myosin head reorientation             during transitions between the different states in the contractile              cycle. We will be able to distinguish between pivoting and spinning             motions of the myosin head.",
