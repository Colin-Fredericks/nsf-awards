 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to stimulate and assist                        teachers of future scientists and engineers in their efforts as                 instructors and advisors by introducing them to new                             developments and illustrating applications of their disciplines                 to the production of consumer goods, i.e. manufacturing.                        Specifically, the project conducts short courses using the Penn                 State University Manufacturing laboratories to assist large                     numbers of faculty (science, mathematics, and engineering) from                 other colleges and universities to learn new ideas and                          techniques in their teaching discipline to add vitality to and                  improve their undergraduate teaching abilities.  The project is                 designed to accommodate a large number of participants, and                     thus will focus both upon the two- and four-year coalition of                   the Penn State Commonwealth campuses and minority colleges and                  universities associated with Penn State.  The association                       between undergraduate courses and the basic principles that are                 used in the manufacture of consumer products are used as a                      vehicle so as to stimulate excitement and the recognition of                    the relevance of the freshman and sophomore undergraduate                       science, mathematics and engineering subject matter.  Students                  in engineering, science and mathematics in the first two years                  of college are often taught the basic principles with the use                   of abstract models that have little relevance to \"real world\"                   applications.  However, manufacturing processes and systems and                 the techniques used to evaluate quality often illustrate                        principles of science, mathematics and engineering.  The                        conduct of this undergraduate faculty enhancement project will                  use manufacturing as a vehicle to illustrate the relevant                       application of basic scientific, mathematical and engineering                   principles.  Illustrations are developed, simulated, and                        modeled to provide a firm relationship between the principle                    and manufacturing application.  Through this procedure the                      disciplinary capabilities and teaching skills of undergraduate                  faculty in science, mathematics and engineering will be                         enhanced.  Further, the use of manufacturing as a vehicle                       demonstrates the relevance of the understanding and application                 of the basic principles to our country's economic vitality.",
