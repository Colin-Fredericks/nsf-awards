 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  program involves the design and synthesis of mixed ionic                  and electronic conducting membranes that promote decomposition                  of nitrogen oxides in automobile exhaust.  The strategy                         depends on a perovskite catalyst to decompose the nitrogen                      oxide and an oxide-ion \"pump\" to remove oxygen from the active                  site.  The conducting membrane and catalytic membrane may be                    the same or different materials.  Research objectives include                   optimization of the catalysts in solid-state electrolytic                       cells and optimization of the components of the mixed                           conducting membranes.  The research clarifies the mechanism of                  decomposition of nitrogen oxides at catalytic sites and the                     conditions required to maintain long-term activity.                             Characteristics of the solid-state membrane necessary for                       achieving rapid oxide-ion mediation away from the reaction                      site are identified; these are optimized for operation at                       representative automobile exhaust temperatures.                                                                                                                 This is an SBIR Phase II effort.  It leads to a long-life,                      low-cost, membrane converter for removing nitrogen oxides from                  automobile exhausts.  This technology is especially applicable                  to lean-burn engines, which are expected to become dominant in                  the future because of their high fuel efficiency.//",
