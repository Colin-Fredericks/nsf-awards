 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the demand for data integrity increases, coding for error               control becomes increasingly important in data communications.  It has          become an integral part in almost every communication system design.            Today very sophisticated coding is used in a broad range of data                communication systems.  this research project is an investigation of            some problems in coding and coded modulation which are both                     theoretically and practically important.  The research includes four            inter- related areas:  (1) multi-level modulation codes and multi-stage         decoding; (2) multi-level concatenated coded modulation schemes and             construction of multi- dimensional modulation codes; (3) trellis                structure of linear block codes; and (4) suboptimum decoding of block           codes.In the first area, the research seeks specific multi-level                methods to construct bandwidth efficient multi-level modulation codes           with good minimum squared Euclidean distance, small path multiplicity,          and desirable structure such as linearity, phase symmetry, and simple           trellis diagrams. To reduce the path multiplicity, proper                       interdependence between consecutive levels of labeling for signal               points and component codes is sought.  Also studied are various multi-          stage decoding schemes for the multi-level modulation codes.  The focus         is to devise multi-stage decoding schemes which achieve good error              performance and large coding gain with reduced decoding complexity.  In         the second area of research, multi-level concatenation in conjunction           with coded modulation is studied for error control in data                      communications to achieve high error-correction performance, large              coding gain, and high spectral efficiency with reduced decoding                 complexity.  This multi-level concatenated coded modulation scheme is           used to construct long powerful multi-dimensional  (block or trellis)           modulation codes with good phase symmetry.  In the third research area,         the focus is on the complexity of the trellis structure of linear block         codes.  Boolean polynomial representation of block codes will be used           for the construction of their minimal trellis diagrams.  It is intended         to find specific permutations on the bit positions of codes which               reduce the state complexity of code trellises.  Emphasis is placed on           finding good codes with simple trellis structure so that maximum                likelihood decoding can be achieved with the Viterbi algorithm.  The            fourth area is an investigation of suboptimum soft-decision decoding            for block codes which can be decomposed into constituent codes with             smaller dimensions and simpler (trellis) structure.  It is intended to          find good codes (such as BCH codes) which are decomposable or are               unions of decomposable codes.",
