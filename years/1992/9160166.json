 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will evaluate a new soft X-ray optic (a                      Soft X-ray Diffraction Plate, SXDP) which is analogous to a                     diffuser in the visible.  Because it can eliminate condenser                    optics and increase photon flux, it will be a useful optic                      wherever optical constants make refractive and reflective                       optical elements difficult.  The first application, in Phase                    II, will be to improve imaging soft X-ray microscopy (ISXM),                    making such microscopes more robust and commercially viable                     instruments.  We anticipate further applications will develop                   in areas where uniformity of illumination and preservation of                   flux are crucial.  X-ray spectroscopy of inhomogeneous sources                  and projection soft X-ray lithography will be among the first                   to benefit.                                                                          The SXDP consists of an opaque film with a multitude of                    small holes, whose size is comparable to the wavelength of the                  X-rays.  This novel X-ray optic may improve flux through ISXMs                  by an order of magnitude and provide good numerical aperture                    matching.  This optic will contribute to the commercial                         development of a compact ISXM.                                                       In Phase I, SXDP models, using analytical and computer                     techniques, will decide which manufacturing method will                         produce optimum SXDPs and evaluate their performance by                         comparing data with theory.",
