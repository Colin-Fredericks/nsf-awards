 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal, the overall aim is to determine the role of                small GTP-binding proteins in the regulation of mitosis. A small                regulator for GTP-binding proteins, called a GDP Dissociation                   Inhibitor (GDI), has been identified from Drosophila melanogaster,              through the developmental mutant known as quartet. In quartet, GDI              fails to undergo a post-translational modification, and processes               regulated by GTP-binding proteins are altered. Prominent among the              anomalies in quartet are changes in mitotic behavior; mitotic                   chromosomal separation is blocked. Thus, chromosomal separation in              mitosis may involve small GTP-binding proteins.                                 %%%                                                                                Mitosis is the process by which already-replicated chromosomes               align, split apart, and then separate into two groups in an orderly             fashion. Mitosis is similar in widely divergent cells throughout                the eukaryotic realm, but our understanding of this process is not              well-developed. The increased availablity of conditional mutants                that exhibit anomalous entry into or progression through mitosis                have proven to be powerful tools with which to dissect the                      mechanisms by which chromosomes move. In this project, a mutant of              Drosophila exhibits anomalous progression through mitosis. The                  underlying mechanism for this block to chromosomal separation                   appears to be linked to a family of regulatory proteins that have               heretofore not been linked to the process. This work has the                    potential to provide important clues about the regulatory                       components that control chromosomal separation in all higher                    organisms.",
