 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in this laboratory deals with microorganisms that                      metabolize xenobiotic compounds, especially aromatic hydrocarbons.              New microbial strains that have diverse capability in terms of                  their ability to degrade different aromatic hydrocarbons will be                isolated by various enrichment culture techniques.  Emphasis is on              obtaining novel strains that have the ability to degrade a wide                 range of related compounds.  The metabolic pathway(s) by which the              aromatic hydrocarbon is degraded will be determined by standard                 biochemical assays and analytical techniques.  Unique enzymes                   showing varied capability will be isolated and characterized.  The              genes involved in the pathway will be cloned and sequence.  Site-               directed mutagenesis will be utilized to explore the molecular                  basis for enzyme structure/function.  The regulatory control                    mechanisms for the various steps of the metabolic pathway will be               analyzed at the molecular level.  New recombinant strains will be               constructed that involve  multiple genes from various sources.  The             goal of these genetically constructed strains is to metabolize as               wide a range of compounds as possible and as efficiently as                     possible.  Currently the laboratory is focusing on polycyclic                   aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalate and phthalate esters, and                      substituted benzenes (chlorobenzene, toluene, and nitrobenzene).                %%%                                                                             This project on aromatic hydrocarbon degradation is environmentally             important in toxic waste removal.  Understanding of the complex                 metabolic pathway for degradation of these compounds will aid in                improving biodegradability.",
