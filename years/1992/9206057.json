 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to better understand the                        interrelationships of protein structure, stability,  and dynamics               using T4 lysozyme as a model.  This moderate sized protein of 164               residues has a known 3-dimensional crystal structure.  The                      protein has two structural domains and no natural disulfide bonds.              Many mutants exist that modulate its thermodynamic                              stability and more than 100 mutant crystal structures have been                 determined by Brian Matthews' laboratory at the University of                   Oregon.  We have assigned the amide resonances of the wild type and             several mutant proteins using modern nuclear magnetic                           resonance techniques (NMR).  We propose to use these methods to                 investigate (1) the ionization behavior of the 19 carboxyl groups               of the protein with the goal of understanding electrostatic and                 polarity effects in the protein; (2) the dynamics of the folded                 state; (3) determine the role in the folding pathway of an early                folding intermediate which was detected as a result of the                      protection to hydrogen exchange it afforded a limited set of                    amides; (4) complete the assignments of the sidechain resonances                with the goal of determining the solution structure of the                      protein.                                                                        %%%                                                                             The linear amino acid sequence of a protein determines the                      complex three-dimensional shape that  protein acquires in                       solution.  This proposal investigates how that linear information               is used to fold the protein into its three-dimensional structure.               We will investigate:  (1) the role of charge-charge interactions in             stabilizing the folded state, (2) the rigidity of the folded state,             (3) the time course of the conversion of a random,                              unfolded polymer chain into the final folded state, and (4) the                 structure, in solution, of the final folded state.",
