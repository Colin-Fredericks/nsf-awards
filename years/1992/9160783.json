 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this program is the development of a novel                          membrane-based two-phase flow system for the separation of                      enantiomers in a racemic mixture.  This system is based on the                  use of chiral fine particles, which selectively adsorb one of                   two enantiomers from an organic solution containing the                         racemic mixture.  Preliminary experimental results support the                  proposed approach.                                                                                                                                              The process promises to offer substantial advantages over                       competing enantiomer-separation processes, including kinetic                    resolution, diasteromeric derivatization, and chiral                            chromatography.  These advantages include: 1) high                              selectivity, 2) low cost, 3) suitability for use on a                           preoperative (e.g., 1- to 100-gram) scale, and 4) wide                          applicability for many chiral compounds.  In Phase I, the                       feasibility of the process for the separation of enantiomers                    of propranolol, an important cardiovascular drug, from a                        racemic mixture will be demonstrated.  In Phase II, the                         approach will be evaluated and characterized for the                            separation of a wide spectrum of pharmacologically relevant                     chiral compounds and the process will be optimized for a                        selected compound.  Based on the commercial promise of this                     concept, it is expected to proceed directly to                                  commercialization of the process in Phase III.",
