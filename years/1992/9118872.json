 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neural plasticity occurs in the auditory neocortex, and is thought              to underlie some forms of learning.  The goal of Dr. Metherate's                research is to understand the cellular bases of neural plasticity.              Neural plasticity is proposed to depend on the interactions between             auditory and neuromodulatory inputs to cortical nerve cells.                    Auditory information is delivered via projections from the auditory             thalamus.  This information is then modified by inputs from                     neuromodulatory systems to produce neural plasticity.  Dr.                      Metherate proposes the following mechanism:  primary auditory                   inputs, which contact close to the cell bodies of cortical neurons,             exert a strong influence over neuronal activity.  While secondary               auditory inputs relay plasticity information to distant parts of                cortical neurons, and exert less influence over neuronal activity               at the cell body.  Modulation of cortical neurons makes them                    electrically more \"compact\".  This allows the secondary inputs to               \"reach\" the cell body, facilitating the integration of primary and              secondary inputs, and lowering the threshold for plasticity to                  occur.  In this study, Dr. Metherate will record the activity                   elicited by primary inputs to determine the threshold for one form              of plasticity called long-term potentiation (LTP).  He will examine             modulation of neural activity, responses to secondary inputs, and               LTP threshold by stimulating two kinds of neuromodulatory inputs:               those from the nucleus basalis and locus coeruleus.  This exciting              project will advance the study of cortical plasticity by                        determining how parallel auditory pathways converge and interact                at the cortex, and how neuromodulatory systems regulate auditory                information processing.  Dr. Metherate's research is an important               model which has intuitive appeal in terms of cortical circuitry and             in relation to memory and other cognitive disorders such as                     Alzheimer's disease.***//",
