 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general objective of this project is to study material                 instabilities, such as phase transitions for fluids and elastic                 solids and metastable equilibrium states for crystals with                      defects, in a Continuum Mechanics framework.  The theoretical                   tools involved in this program are continuum mechanics, geometric               measure theory, partial differential equations,                                 thermoelastodynamics and the calculus of variations.                                 Relaxation and lower semicontinuity properties of nonconvex                bulk and interfacial energies will be obtained and singular                     perturbation methods will be used in nonlinear elasticity to                    resolve nonuniqueness of equilibria.  These results will help us                understand and predict the surface structures and geometries of                 crystals subjected to thermal or mechanical treatments.                              When the minimum energy is not attained, the role played by                the surface tension in stabilizing the oscillations, and the                    dynamical creation of the microstructure and its evolution within               the framework of generalized measure-valued solutions, will be                  studied.  Thermochemical equilibria for coherent two-phase alloys               when physical variables, such as composition, are taken into                    account will be considered.  This study will enable predicting                  the dependence of equilibrium phase composition on the overall                  composition and volume fraction.                                                     Models to analyze defect interaction, dislocations,                        different types and arrangements of domains and global effects of               defects will be addressed.  In particular, variational                          formulations for metastable equilibria of elastoplastic crystals                with defects will be analyzed.                                                       The mathematical problems addressed in this project -- phase               transitions for fluids and alloys, equilibrium states for                       crystals with defects, defect interaction and global effects of                 defects -- are areas of intense work in contemporary material                   science.  Only recently they have been addressed mathematically                 in a systematic way.  The questions involved escape the framework               of classical mathematical theories.  Therefore, accomplishing                   these goals will require manipulation of some very recent                       mathematical tools and possibly the introduction of new ones.                   Addressing such issues may have a significant impact in the                     industry and technology as it will help to predict the surface                  structures and geometries of crystals subjected to thermal or                   mechanical treatments and, in general, it will promote a better                 understanding of smart materials.",
