 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Telenominae is a group of minute wasps that all parasitize and              thereby destroy the eggs of other insects.  Nearly 600 different                species have so far been recognized, but this represents but a                  minor portion of its total diversity.  The hosts that are attacked              and killed include many species of agricultural, silvicultural, and             medical importance.  As a result, these wasps are often proposed                as possible biological control agents.  Achievement of this                     potential as non-chemical methods of affecting pest insect                      populations has been severely inhibited by our inability to                     recognize and distinguish among the many forms.  The overall goal               of this project is to address this problem:  to establish means for             identifying these wasps and to study their evolution and                        distribution.  This proposal focuses on the species classified as               Trissolcus and Paratelenomus.  Both groups are egg parasites of                 stink bugs and their allies (including the major pests, the rice                stink bug and the southern green stink bug).  Previous studies have             addressed the diversity of species in the Americas, Australia, and              tropical Asia.  This project will complete the study of these two               groups by incorporating work on the African and temperate Eurasian              faunas.  It will culminate in a worldwide summary of the scientific             classification of the species, of the patterns of their                         evolutionary relationships, and an analysis of the biogeographic                patterns.  This will provide the framework for further studies of               the evolution of their biology.",
