 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much current literature, covering a variety of sensory modes and                animal groups, focuses on identifying cues that individuals use                 to assess one another and on the evolution of those cues.  Such                 cues may be used during either interactions between animals of                  the same sex or interactions between animals of opposite sex.                   How animals perceive one another during these interactions has                  important implications for evolution of traits.  Understanding                  how animals may use vocal cues has been hampered, however, by the               difficulty of establishing cause and effect, rather than just                   correlation, between the vocal behavior and its possible                        consequences.  By taking advantage of the vocal learning                        abilities of songbirds, Dr. Kroodsma will be able to                            experimentally \"assign\" different vocal behaviors to different                  individuals.  With cues assigned at random and therefore                        irrespective of other male qualities, hypothesis testing can                    proceed.  Initial studies will focus on song repertoire size in                 marsh wrens, and study of other vocal behaviors in other species                will follow.  Individuals with \"assigned behaviors\" become                      invaluable in other experiments that test for cause-and-effect                  relationships between behavior and brain characteristics;                       correlations have been discovered between song repertoire size                  and the volume of song control centers in the avian forebrain,                  for example, but until either the behavior (as in Dr. Kroodsma's                experiments) or the brain is manipulated experimentally, one                    cannot determine the direction of causation.",
