 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of active labor market policies, such as job               placement, job training, and job creation policies in 17 nations                from 1950 to 1988.  Active labor market policies consist of                     direct government intervention into labor markets for the primary               purpose of reducing unemployment.  It presumes that participants                are ready and willing to work.  Labor market policies constitute                the most active policy in the otherwise passive welfare state                   repertoire, because its goals are to make the labor force more                  flexible in adjusting to the restructuring of the domestic and                  international economies.  The focus of the study is to examine                  the relationship between the political and economic                             characteristics of a society and its labor market policies.  Data               from official statistics in the 17 countries will be analyzed                   using time-series models, pooled cross-sectional models, and a                  combination of regression analysis and institutional analysis.                       This study will make a major contribution to the                           understanding of the conditions under which governments will                    develop active welfare state policies aimed at reintegrating                    citizens into the labor market rather than relying on more                      passive policies such as welfare benefits.",
