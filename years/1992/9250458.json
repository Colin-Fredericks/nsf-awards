 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new upper-level course in observational astronomy using an                    existing Celestron 14-inch telescope is being developed.  The                   observations cover a wide range of topics in modern astronomy.                  A CCD camera is used to obtain images of star clusters, HII                     regions, and galaxies as the basis for instruction in image                     processing.  Multicolor CCD photometry is done on an open                       cluster in order to plot the cluster's Hertzsprung Russell                      diagram.  CCD photometry is also done on short period variables                 to determine their light curves.  Classification spectroscopy                   of stars is performed using a grating spectrograph with a low                   dispersion grating and film or the CCD camera.  High velocity                   spectroscopic binary stars are observed with a high dispersion                  grating and the CCD camera on the spectrograph to determine                     their orbital velocities.  The observations are possible with                   the inexpensive telescope because they are primarily based on                   bright objects, and because the telescope is automatically                      guided by a second CCD camera, already on the telescope.                        Students can pursue independent research projects on fainter                    objects with the same equipment.  Data obtained with the                        equipment is also used in the introductory astronomy course.",
