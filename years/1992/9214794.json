 "awd_abstract_narration": "Immobilized Artificial Membranes (IAMs) are solid silica                        particles, containing, on their surfaces, phospholipids                         covelantly attached  to the silica surface by linkage  to the                   end of  one of the  fatty acid chains of the phospolipid. Thus                  the polar headgroups of the phospholipids protrude away from                    the silica surface. These surfaces are prepared with                            attachement densities of the order of phospholipid monolayer                    densities. Therefore the silica surfaces resemble one-half of                   the  lipid bilayer of a biomembrane, and they are intended to                   mimic the lipid environment of biomembranes. In particular,                     these surfaces can be used for the chromatographic separation                   and purification of membrane bound proteins: Membrane proteins                  embedded in endogeneous cell membranes exhibit multiple types                   of binding to membrane lipids. The working principle behind                     using IAM  surfaces in the chromatographic separation of                        membrane proteins is that if these  proteins, extracted and in                  a mobile carrier phase, are passed over IAMs tailored to                        resemble the lipid microenvironment of the biomembranes from                    which they came,  the IAM surface, taking advantage of the                      multiple binding sites, ought to be able to selectively bind                    the protein.  Previous research by the PI on IAMs was                           supported by a prior NSF grant (CTS8408450). This research                      began by examining a prototype IAM surface containing                           diacylphosphatidylcholine  (PC) molecules covelantly linked to                  silica propylamine.  Early research indicated that these                        prototypes leaked lipids, and the PI solved this problem by                     using ether linked single chained lipids, and end caping, with                  alkyl anhydrides, unreacted propylamine groups.  After the                      leakage problem was solved, the PI used ether-linked, capped                    PC- IAMs to chromatographically separate and purify small                       molecules such as deoxynucleotides, amphetamines and fatty                      acids, and large molecules such as several species of                           cytochrome P450.    The proposed research focuses on  varying                   the surface binding characteristics by preparing IAMs with PC                   and a secondary phospholipid.. The secondary phospholipids are                  phosphatidylethanolamine,  phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidyic                  acid and phosphatidylserine.  After preparing these different                   IAMs,  the affinity of the mixed phospholipid surfaces to two                   model proteins, cytochromes P450 and phospholipase A2 (PLA2)                    will be studied in an effort to elucidate the binding                           mechanisms of the proteins to the surfaces. These proteins                      have been selected because their structure has been well                        studied. The research will also invesitigate an affinity                        removal  procedure for extracting the bound proteins from the                   surface. In this procedure, the single chained lipids are                       dissolved in an aqueous carrier phase at concentrations high                    enough to form micelles. These micelles can act as reservoirs                   of  lipid; as the carrier phase passes over the IAM surface,                    lipid molecules can force desorption by intercalating                           themselves into the lipid layer, and then displacing  and                       ultimately solubilizing the protein molecule.  In addition,                     31P-NMR will be used to evaluate the rotational properties of                   the immobilized lipid headgroups, both in the presence and                      absence of bound protein.",
