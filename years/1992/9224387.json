 "awd_abstract_narration": "This international, group travel grant supports six American                    Undergraduate engineering students who will complete a                          coordinated program of academic and industrial research in                      Germany.  The nominal model consists of a three month period                    during the summer of 1993.  The first two months of the                         program will consist of research at a German University.                        Normally, the research will be of an experimental nature.  The                  third month will be devoted to engineering research and                         development activities in a company in Germany.  The German                     company is expected to pay for living costs associated with                     the work experience during the third month.  It is anticipated                  that these relatively short experiences will encourage                          students to become involved in longer term commitments related                  to US/German engineering collaborative exchanges, possibly                      work for an American Subsidiary in German.  The technical                       focus of all the undergraduate research projects will be:                       Problems in Separations, Interfacial, and Transport Phenomena.                  Applicants will be sought throughout the U.S. Applications                      must describe the cooperation and support of an American                        faculty member and a German faculty member, as well as the                      participating industry.  The highest priority for travel                        awards are given to Chemical and Mechanical Engineering                         undergraduate students with the strongest combination of a                      detailed program plan, academic excellence, German language                     skills, and past experience in industry or international                        relations.",
