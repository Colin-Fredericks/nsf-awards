 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a year-long, event-based science                      (EBS) curriculum for heterogeneously grouped, middle school                     students for use primarily in departmentalized earth science                    classes.  Nationally disseminated products will include                         textbook, teacher resource notebook, and video tape and/or                      videodisc support.  Five features will set EBS apart from                       other approaches to science instruction and curriculum                          writing. 1)  The event focus will make each unit topical and                    relevant to early adolescents.  It will allow science to                        become less compartmentalized.  It allows for a natural                         highlighting of nontraditional roles filled by women and                        minorities.  2)  The interdisciplinary nature of this even                      focus will be enhanced by the collaboration between project                     writers and teacher/advisory and consultant panels.  Three                      teacher/advisory panels of Montgomery County Public School                      (MCPS) earth science teachers will contribute content and                       activity ideas.  3)  A team of eighth grade students will                       tests materials as they are developed.  Particular attention                    will be paid to interest reactions of the students.  High                       interest activities will become models for other activities.                    4)  EBS will stress alternative assessment techniques and                       grading strategies which reward success and downplay                            failure.  5)  EBS will utilize the news media as one source.                    6)  EBS will be a national project developed as a                               collaborative effort of MCPS, the US Government, and                            professional and news agencies.  Montgomery County is                           uniquely positioned to take advantage of the help available                     from these agencies.",
