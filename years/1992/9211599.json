 "awd_abstract_narration": "Like structural or physiological traits, the components of                      cognition can be thought of as solutions or adaptations to                      problems posed by natural environments.  Therefore, a complete                  understanding of a cognitive function requires an understanding                 of the problem it was designed to solve.  Of these problems, one                of the most vexing is the variability found in nature.  Such                    unpredictability would seem to diminish or defeat the value of                  learning and memory.  Of what use is a memory for a good foraging               site if that site is as likely to be poor as to be good on later                visits?                                                                                                                                                         Drs. Lynn Devenport and Jill Devenport have begun their research                by establishing the optimal or ideal solution to the variability                problem and expressing it in a quantitative model.  Put in words,               the model says that as time passes and information ages,                        decisions should be based less and less on recent outcomes (say,                a good harvest at a foraging site) and more and more on long-term               regularities (the average harvest at that site).                                                                                                                The researchers will conduct field experiments to find how                      closely animals approach this ideal.  To do this, they will                     provision wild populations of ground-dwelling squirrels (least                  chipmunks) at two or more artificial \"patches\" of food (unhulled                sunflower seeds) whose variability and abundance the researchers                control.  Some patches are occasionally very productive, but in                 the long run poor, others are sometimes poor but in the long run                quite good, and yet others fluctuate both in the short and long                 term.  Having provided this experience, the researchers impose                  delays of minutes or days before the animals can resume foraging                at the patches.  The model specifies how animals should choose                  among patches if they were to make the best use of their                        information.  Beyond the aim of determining how closely (if at                  all) animals approach this ideal, the researchers will make the                 problem complex enough to ensure a plausible correspondence to                  natural foraging conditions.  The project should help identify                  cognitive mechanisms that minimize uncertainty, and point to                    their evolutionary origins.",
