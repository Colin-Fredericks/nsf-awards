 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project by Dr. Fuchs to study the biophysical mechanisms              by which brainstem neurons exert inhibition of the sensory receptor             cells of the cochlea.  The sensitivity of the inner ear is                      controlled by central neurons whose axons project to the cochlea                and there release the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh) to                  inhibit the cochlear cell (hair cells).  While the actions of ACh               are well-known on nerve and muscle, the hair cell cholinergic                   receptor and its physiological effect, are quite unusual.  ACh                  inhibits hair cells first causing calcium entry, followed by a                  calcium-activated potassium current which actually hyperpolarizes,              and inhibits, the cell.  These actions are mediated by a                        neurotransmitter receptor that appears to be related to the                     nicotinic receptors of nerve and muscle.  While unusual, there is               some evidence that similar cholinergic effects may occur elsewhere              in the brain.  Dr. Fuchs will identify and study the mechanism of               cholinergic inhibition of cochlear hair cells and its developmental             regulation.  He will use state-of-the-art techniques to explore                 these mechanisms and the hair cell ACh receptor will be                         characterized both pharmacologically and physiologically.  This                 detailed study of the hair cell ACh receptor will provide                       fundamental insights into brain cholinergic systems.***//",
