 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigation looks at newly discovered groups               of archaebacteria found recently by molecular genetic analysis of               marine bacterioplankton.  DNA sequences from these organisms                    were recovered from samples collected at one site in the                        oligotrophic open Pacific Ocean at depths of 100m and 500m.                     This group made up most (70%) of the clones obtained from 500m,                 so there is a suggestion that they may be very important in the                 biomass and metabolism of deeper waters.  Given the \"unusual\"                   nature of the niches ordinarily occupied by most archaebacteria                 in other habitats (extreme thermophiles, strictly anaerobic                     methanogens, extreme halophiles, etc.), this occurrence of                      archaebacteria may suggest unexpected metabolic and                             biogeochemical processes in the ocean's vast interior.                               Dr. Fuhrman will perform nucleic acid probe analysis on                    additional midwater and deep sea samples to see if this group of                bacteria is repeatably found in the interior ocean, and if so, to               estimate the relative abundance of these organisms compared to                  other types of microbes.  He will repeat the sequence analysis in               samples that test positive, to determine if the organisms are                   indistinguishable from those already found.  Additionally, he                   will attempt the very difficult culturing from fresh seawater                   samples to determine if these organisms can be enriched and                     possibly isolated from seawater for laboratory study.  Along with               a marine organic geochemist, he will analyse lipids for types                   unique to archaebacteria.                                                            The conditions of enrichment plus information on the                       abundance of these organisms may indicate the significance of                   biogeochemical transformations mediated by these organisms.                     While the preliminary data indicate these organisms may be major                contributors to midwater processes, there is a risk of not                      finding them again.",
