 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polyploidy, the condition in an organism of having more than               two complete sets of chromosomes, is a common and important                     evolutionary phenomenon in flowering plants (angiosperms), but the              historical development of polyploidy is poorly understood.  Many                questions about the base chromosome number of angiosperms                       (important for establishing the extent of polyploidy) and the                   origin of polyploidy could be addressed if fossil plants could be               used to determine its history.  One of the common physical effects              of polyploidy is a general increase in cell volume and in the size              of guard cells, the leaf epidermal cells that control the opening               and closing of the gas exchange pores or stomates of plants.  At                least two previous studies have used guard cell measurements to                 estimate ploidy levels in fossil taxa of Sequoia and Metasequoia.                    The paleobotanist Dr. Peter Crane of the Field Museum and                  University of Chicago will supervise graduate student Jane                      Masterson in an analysis of the history of polyploidy in four woody             angiosperm families: Platanaceae (sycamores), Magnoliaceae,                     Juglandaceae (walnuts), and Lauraceae (laurels).  These groups were             chosen because all have (1) a long record of fossil remains; (2)                well preserved leaf cuticle samples with measurable guard cells at              a variety of growth stages; (3) multiple ploidy levels presently                known for living species; and (4) a positive correlation between                cell size and ploidy level based on preliminary study, including                measurement of DNA content in chromosomes using                                 microspectrophotometry.  The work will establish the antiquity of               polyploidy in several angiosperm families and circumscribe the                  paleoecological conditions that may have promoted polyploidy.  It               will contribute empirical data to the debate surrounding the base               chromosome number of flowering plants, and provide the first test               in plants of the hypothesized inverse relation between evolutionary             diversification (numbers of species in a lineage) and genome size               (numbers of chromosomes and DNA amounts).",
