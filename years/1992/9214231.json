This seminar will be                                 held in Nairobi, Kenya, September 21-28, 1992,                                  during the First International Congress of the                                  African Association of Physiological Sciences,                                  a new, continent-wide organization.  The                                        congress is sponsored by the International                                      Union of Physiological Sciences.  The seminar                                   will address issues currently particularly                                      relevant to African countries, many of which                                    are experiencing unusual weather changes.                                       Besides the scientists funded under this grant,                                 an additional eight scientists from developed                                   countries will participate.  The main                                           objectives of the overall congress are to                                       stimulate scientific interchange and                                            cooperative research among African                                              physiologists, and to promote collaborative                                     research between scientists based in developed                                  countries with colleagues in Africa.                                            The seminar promises to be mutually beneficial                                  for U.S. and African scientists by providing a                                  forum for exchange of data on thermal                                           physiology in various species, and advancing                                    understanding of physiological adaptation to                                    drought.  The establishment of active Africa-                                   wide professional societies will promote                                        research cooperation and networking throughout                                  the region.  This project is relevant to the                                    objectives of the Science in Developing                                         Countries (SDC) Program with regard to                                          strengthening the scientific infrastructure in                                  developing countries, and increasing the level                                  of cooperation between U.S. scientists and                                      their counterparts in developing countries.",
