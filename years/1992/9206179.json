 "awd_abstract_narration": "Perception of environmental conditions and initiation of                        appropriate responses to these conditions is crucial for survival               of all organisms.  Additionally, individual cells of multicellular              organisms must detect and respond to signals which coordinate the               behavior and physiology of the whole organism.  In contrast to the              case for animal systems, little is known about transduction                     pathways coupling signals to cellular responses in plants.  The                 coupling of light reception to leaflet movement in the tropical                 legume Samanea saman and of environmental stress to deflagellation              in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are signal                    response systems that appear to involve calcium.  We hypothesize                that inositolphospholipid and phosphatidylcholine turnover which                produces inositol phosphates, lysophosphatidylcholine and                       diacylglycerol, and which results in mobilization of cellular                   calcium and protein phosphorylation mediates these responses.  To               elucidate the specific role of phospholipid turnover in these                   systems we will:  i.) correlate temporally changes in                           inositolphospholipid and phosphatidylcholine metabolism and                     intracellular calcium levels with signal reception and cell                     response, ii.) examine effects of agents that perturb the                       functioning of inositolphospholipid metabolism and calcium                      homeostasis on physiological responses to signals, and iii.) purify             and characterize the putative regulatory enzyme phospholipase C                 with the aim of understanding its role in plant signal                          transduction.",
