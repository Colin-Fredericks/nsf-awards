 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objective of this research is to gain a greater                understanding of the structure and function of actin-based                      cytoskeletons.  This project is designed to investigate the roles               of T-protein, a huge protein that recently has been discovered as               a component of the extensively characterized intestinal epithelial              cell brush border cytoskeleton.  Based on polypeptide molecular                 weight, molecular morphology, and immunocrossreactivity, brush                  border T-protein appears to be a nonmuscle isoform of the muscle                protein titin.  Muscle titin is a key structural component                      associated with the myosin thick filaments in sarcomeres.                       Likewise, T-protein is co-localized with myosin in brush borders,               and T-protein and brush border myosin assemble into supramolecular              structures in vitro.  The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1)             determine the existence and structural organization of T-protein in             different domains of the intestinal epithelial cell brush border                cytoskeleton and in cytoskeletal structures, including stress                   fibers, in other types of cells; 2) investigate the role of T-                  protein in organizing brush border cytoskeletal assembly during                 embryonic development of intestinal epithelial cells; and 3)                    characterize interactions between T-protein and other cytoskeletal              components, including myosin.  Results of these studies should                  elucidate the importance of nonmuscle titin in governing the                    organization of cytoskeletons and their ability to produce force                for critical cellular processes.                                                %%%                                                                             The most obvious form of movement in biological systems is muscular             motility.  In muscle tissue, and particularly in skeletal muscle,               contractile behavior results in gross movements of organs, such as              the bending of an elbow or the turn of a head.  These gross                     movements are the composite result of intracellular movements of                protein complexes with respect to one another.  The major                       intracellular contractile proteins in muscle are actin and myosin,              which form oligomeric filaments that slide past each other in an                ATP-fueled controlled reaction that results in cellular shortening.             Whole muscles shorten (contract) as a composite result of the cells             within the muscle shortening.  However, cellular and intracellular              movement is not limited to muscle tissue; virtually all types of                eukaryotic cells display various actin / myosin based motility                  behaviors, ranging from cellular crawling to the separation of                  daughter cells after mitosis.  While the muscle system is quite                 well understood in molecular detail, the extent to which these non-             muscle actin /myosin based motility systems resemble muscle, in                 terms of molecular organization, is unclear.  The Principal                     Investigator has now identified a non-muscle version of a major                 muscle protein which plays an important role in muscle actomyosin               based motility.  The experiments which will be performed in this                project will elucidate the role played by the T-protein in non-                 muscle motility, and will thereby contribute greatly to our general             understanding of cellular movement.",
