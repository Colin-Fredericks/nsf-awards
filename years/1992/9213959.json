 "awd_abstract_narration": "About the time that children begin to talk, there are also                      important changes in their problem-solving abilities.  Are these                two developments related?  In particular, does learning to use                  certain words allow children to solve new problems?  This research              will explore two areas of problem solving that might be related to              language.  When they are about eighteen months old, children begin              to classify objects in new ways.  When they see a mixed-up group of             different kinds of objects, they may put each kind of object into               a separate pile.  At about the same time, they often have \"a naming             spurt\", suddenly beginning to name every object they see.  In                   earlier research, there was a relation between these two                        developments, with children who had a naming spurt early also                   beginning to group objects early.  Also at about eighteen months,               children begin to use words like \"in\" and \"out,\" while at about the             same time beginning to understand how containers work in a new way.             This research will explore whether these two developments are also              related.  The research will compare children who hear different                 kinds of languages, in order to try to tell whether the new words               are leading to the new problem-solving abilities.  Korean- and                  Japanese-speaking mothers use many fewer names than English                     speakers, and they use more words that talk about movement,                     particularly verbs.  Korean- and Japanese-speaking children may                 develop the ability to classify objects later, but may develop the              ability to understand containers earlier.  In addition, the                     research will explore the effects of exposing different English-                speaking children to many names or alternatively to many verbs.                 Children who are particularly exposed to names may be advanced in               classifying but not in understanding containers, while those                    exposed to verbs may show the opposite pattern.  Learning to talk               may allow children to think in new ways, and the specific words                 they hear may influence the kinds of problems they can solve.",
