 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth of continents at their margins is an important                  process encompassing a variety of poorly understood mechanisms.                 Although well-studied, there remain major unresolved questions                  about the tectonic evolution of the Sierra Nevada in California                 that resulted in accretion of arc material and various terranes to              the North American continent.  Prior work has outlined a number of              alternatives for aspects of the Mesozoic activity in this area                  including the cause and timing of metamorphism and igneous                      intrusion.  This project is a collaborative, integrated study of                deformation and metamorphism in the central part the Foothills                  Terrane, a key are containing a number of through-going faults                  separating significantly different assemblages of rock.  Results                are expected to resolve differences in conclusions drawn for the                Foothills Terrane to the north and south and to provide the basis               for an integrated model for the construction and deformation of                 arcs in this tectonic setting.",
