 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental understanding of the formation of metal overlayers on             compound semiconductor surfaces will provide valuable insight into              a variety of complex metal-interfacial phenomena crucial to the                 intelligent design of electronic devices.  This work will focus on              developing a quantitative model of the kinetic processes associated             with the formation and development of ordered structures for                    metallic films on compound semiconductor surfaces.  Initial efforts             will focus on the adsorption of group V and metals on the surface               of III-V compound semiconductors.                                               %%%                                                                             In the first phase of the research, a newly developed time-                     dependent Monte Carlo model will be combined with tight-binding and             first-principles pseudopotential total energy models to investigate             the growth of antimony and bismuth on gallium arsenide in the sub-              monolayer to one monolayer regime.  The desciption of fundamental               chemical processes such as chemisorption, migration, incorporation,             and desorption, will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of             the elementary surface reactions.  In the second phase of the                   research the growth of antimony and bismuth in the range of two -               twenty monolayers will be examined where factors controlling                    pseudomorphic growth and the transition to three-dimensional island             growth take place.  Future work will address the issue of film                  defect formation, such as the nature of two-dimensional island                  growth during deposition, and identification of the conditions                  important for defect formation.                                                 The grant supports a postdoctoral associate and is done in                      collaboration with researchers at Battelle Pacific Northwest                    Laboratories.",
