 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to assess the degree to which                 deposit feeding populations in field circumstances are limited by               food, in the context of changes in nutritional quality of the                   sediment over spatial and temporal scales.  Past research has                   demonstrated that newly deposited seaweed based detritus                        contributes substantially to population growth of deposit feeders,              but that the particulate organic matter in the sediment also is of              great importance.  Seasonal studies over the last two years                     demonstrate that the sediment promotes declining population growth              from spring to fall and carbon retention also declines when a                   deposit feeder ingests spring versus fall sediment.  These findings             will be extended to experimental studies on the addition of                     detritus in the field, since a diagnostic marker of lateral                     transport of detritus is available.  The experimental addition                  studies will be combined with the marker approach as well as with               caged controls for predation, to examine the impact of detrital                 addition and seasonal organic matter change in the sediment on the              population growth of the dominant oligochaete worm, Paranais                    litoralis, and on the behavior of the mud snails, Ilyanassa                     obsoleta and Hydrobia truncata.  Interactions between feeding                   behavior, sediment deposition and flow will also be examined.  This             study will be the first to utilize the combined spatial and                     temporal approach to examine detrital limitation of surface feeding             benthic field populations.",
