 "awd_abstract_narration": "In every drop of water, down at the scale of atoms and                          molecules, there is a world that can fascinate anyone -                         ranging from a non-verbal young science student to an ardent                    science-phobe.  The objective of Learning Science Through                       Guided Discovery: Liquid Water & Molecular Networks is to                       use advanced technology to provide a window into this                           submicroscopic world, and thereby allow students to discover                    by themselves a new world.  We are developing a coordinated                     two-fold approach in which a cycle of hands-on activities,                      games, and experimentation is followed by a cycle of                            computer simulations employing the full power of computer                       animation to \"ZOOM\" into the depths of his or her newly-                        discovered world, an interactive experience surpassing that                     of an OMNIMAX theater.  Pairing laboratory experiments with                     corresponding simulations challenges students to understand                     multiple representations of concepts.  Answers to student                       questions, resolution of student misconceptions, and                            eventual personalized student discoveries are all guided by                     a clear set of \"cues\" which we build into the computer                          display.  Moreover, the ability to visualize \"real-time\"                        dynamic motions allows for student-controlled animated                          graphic simulations on the molecular scale and interactive                      guided lessons superior to those afforded by even the most                      artful of existing texts.  While our general approach could                     be applied to a variety of topics, we have chosen to focus                      first on water; later we will test the generality of the                        approach by exploring macromolecules such as proteins and                       DNA.                                                                                                                                                            The simulation sofware we have been developing embodies a                       simple molecular interaction model but requires leading edge                    computing in order to (1) apply the model to large enough                       systems to yield simple and realistic behavior, and (2)                         animate the result in real time with advanced graphics.  Our                    ultimate goal in this project is not only to help students                      learn science, but also to help them learn to think like                        research scientists.  By looking at scientific knowledge as                     a set of useful models - models that are essentially                            temporary and will inevitably lead to better ones - they can                    see that science is not a set of facts, but a method for                        discovering patterns and predictability in an otherwise                         disordered and unpredictable world.  Through mastery of the                     simulation software, students will gain the self-confidence                     to embark on their own missions of discovery.",
