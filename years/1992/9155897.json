 "awd_abstract_narration": "An educational computer program is to be constructed that will                  enable students to observe and manipulate the internal                          mechanisms of a simulated computer software and hardware                        system.  The program will enable students to view the workings                  of the compiler as it translates source language to machine                     language and the machine architecture as it executes the                        machine instructions.                                                                                                                                           The system will also provide the basis for a number of                          exercises for students who will be able to modify the existing                  simulation or create their own mechanisms.                                                                                                                      The purpose of the system is to support the teaching of the                     first course in computer science for all students.  It is                       expected to facilitate the teaching of the fundamental                          mechanisms of computing to an unusual level for such first                      courses.  The design of the system grows out of a course                        developed at Duke over the past five years which is now being                   adopted at many major colleges and universities.",
