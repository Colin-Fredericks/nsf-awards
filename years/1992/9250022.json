 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Utah State Board of Education has approved the licensing                    of elementary mathematics specialists and each institution in                   the state of Utah has been given the opportunity to develop                     and submit a certification program for approval.  Weber State                   University seeks funds to develop this new program which will                   have as its foundation the guidelines set forth in the                          Curriculum and Evaluation Standards  of the National Council                    of Teachers of Mathematics and in the NCTM Professional                         Standards for the Teaching of Mathematics.  The program will                    be developed in the mathematics department in collaboration                     with the College of Education, and will include eight new                       courses:  geometry, intuitive calculus, probability and                         statistics, discrete mathematics, the use of technology,                        number theory, problem solving, and a senior project.                           Technology will be integrated throughout the program and                        modeled in the courses.                                                         An advisory group with members from all the teacher                             preparation programs in the state will work with Weber State                    University in the planning, implementation and dissemination.                   Nationally recognized mathematics educator will serve as                        consultants and advisors as well.                                                                                                                               The contribution of Weber State University accounts for 26% of                  the funds requested from NSF.",
