The objective of these meetings is                        to identify areas and topics of civilian-oriented basic                         research in which former Soviet weapons scientists can                          work in concert with American researchers as well as to                         identify potential partnerships between specific ex-Soviet                      and American researchers.  Proposals for actual support of                      such research will subsequently be  submitted to the State                      Department's Special Coordinator on FSU Non-Proliferation                       Policy and considered for funding either under the                              International Science Center that has recently been                             created by the Department of State or conceivably under                         existing bilateral arrangements, including the NSF's                            cooperative science programs.",
