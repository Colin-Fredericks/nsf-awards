 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognizing objects from a single view is hard, because their                appearance depends crucially on the direction from which they are               viewed.  Curved surfaces are particularly subject to this effect.               This research concentrates on recognizing curved surfaces from                  their outline in a single perspective image, using both                         theoretical studies and practical implementations, along two                    lines of investigation.  The problem has already been solved for                generic algebraic surfaces by the Principal Investigator.  The                  result indicates that an image outline contains substantial                     amounts of information about an object's shape.  The research                   will investigate extending this result to a wider range of                      popular surfaces, and will also investigate the practicalities of               applying the resulting algorithms.  Recent work by the PI and                   colleagues suggests that there is a large range of surface models               which are intrinsically easy to recognize.  These results suggest               building a surface modeller oriented specifically towards                       computer vision applications, where the resulting models would be               a fortiori easy to identify from any view.  The research will                   investigate theoretical issues involved in constructing such a                  modeller, and will implement simple modelling system with these                 properties.",
