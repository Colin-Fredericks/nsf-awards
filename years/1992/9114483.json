 "awd_abstract_narration": "The search for satisfactory models of turbulence is still                  one of the major problems of mathematics and physics.  Because of               its importance in diverse areas such as aeronautics, geophysical                fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, magnetohydrodynamics, and                 astrophysics, tremendous effort has been devoted to its study                   over the last few decades.  A broad spectrum of mathematical                    tools from partial differential equations, stochastic processes,                statistical mechanics, dynamical systems, renormalization theory,               statistics, and functional analysis has been employed in an                     effort to elucidate its nature.                                                      This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research                    Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on Turbulence of                        Nonlinear Waves with Applications to Geophysics and Oceanography                to be held May 25-29, 1992 at Case Western Reserve University.                  Professor Vladimir Zakharov of the Landau Institute of                          Theoretical Physics (Moscow) and the University of Arizona will                 be the principal lecturer.  To stimulate interest and activity in               mathematical research, the National Science Foundation each year                supports a number of NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conferences in                  the Mathematical Sciences.  Each five-day conference features a                 distinguished lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic of                  important current research in one sharply focused area of the                   mathematical sciences.  The lecturer subsequently prepares an                   expository monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally               published by the American Mathematical Society or the Society for               Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the American                  Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical                       Statistics.  Certain features differentiate these conferences                   from typical research conferences.  These are: (1) Focus on a                   single important and timely area of research by a leading                       practitioner, (2) Continued effect and local stimulation through                regional emphasis, (3) Panel review for quality, breadth, and                   timeliness, and (4) Published monographs for a wider audience.",
