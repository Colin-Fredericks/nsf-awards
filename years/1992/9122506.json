 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Bruce Berne is supported by a grant from the                          Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                      theoretical studies of solutions.  Berne will study solvent                     effects on chemical reaction dynamics, solvation and                            spectra, energy transfer and transport in classical and                         quantum many-body systems through a combination of                              analytical and numerical techniques.  The numerical work                        will involve molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, quantum Monte                     Carlo, and quantum chemistry.  He will attempt to incorporate                   many-body dispersion and electrical induction forces by                         treating the full coulomb interaction between dispersion                        oscillators on atomic or extended atomic sites.  A special                      focus will be on the development and application of                             analytical and new computer simulation techniques to treat                      the problem of multiple time scales and long range forces.                      Berne will attempt to incorporate quantum chemistry into                        his molecular dynamics codes so that the charges and forces                     governing the dynamics are computed quantum chemically on                       the fly.                                                                        %%%                                                                             Since most chemical reactions occur in solution, it is                          important for chemists to have a complete understanding of                      solute-solvent interactions at the molecular level.                             Computer simulations provide an excellent method for                            examining the effects of these interactions on chemical                         reaction dynamics, observed spectra, and transport                              properties.  Professor Berne's research efforts are directed                    at the development of new computational algorithms which                        enhance the capability and reliability of such computer                         simulations.",
