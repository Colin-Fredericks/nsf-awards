They will                                    apply Dr. Song's expertise in shock-induced                                     chemical reactions of Ni-Al to conduct research                                 on shock-induced chemical reactions of the                                      reactive metallic and inorganic powder system                                   of Nb-Si.                                                                                                                                                       The high pressures and temperatures associated                                  with shock-induced reactions of porous reactive                                 materials give rise to the creation of new                                      materials despite a duration of only a few                                      microseconds.  The resulting extensive plastic                                  deformation, turbulent flow, mechanical mixing,                                 and surface cleansing yield nano-crystalline                                    new materials such as carbynes, C3N4.  Song and                                 Yoshida will utilize different methods of                                       spectroscopy to study and model the shock-                                      induced chemical reactions of the reactive                                      powder Nb-Si system and their research will                                     perhaps lead to a method of synthesis of new                                    materials such as C3N4 and BO6 which are as hard                                as diamonds.",
