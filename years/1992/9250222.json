 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to acquire a set of hardware and                    software that will provide flexibility in supporting CASE                       (Computer-aided Software Engineering) tools for project-                        oriented courses.  The project will acquire five SUN                            workstations with UNIX operating system and X-window protocol                   and appropriate CASE software tools.  A laboratory manual for                   the selected tools will be developed which will be tutorial in                  nature with the purpose of getting the students into the CASE                   tool environment as quickly as possible.  One of the biggest                    drawbacks with teaching software engineering process without                    CASE tools is that it is difficult for the students to see the                  benefits of the iteration and control processes in the software                 development.  This software engineering laboratory setup will                   allow emphasis on these processes without undue burden on the                   students' part to manually track documents and artifacts.",
