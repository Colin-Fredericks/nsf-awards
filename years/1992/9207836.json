 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contemporary geographical information systems (GIS) embody a               number of functions that are directly analogous to tasks humans                 normally perform in cognizing and evaluating space.  Since GIS                  have become important tools for storing and analyzing spatially                 referenced information and have many practical applications in                  economic, social, and environmental planning, it is important                   that the configuration of knowledge in GIS accurately reflects                  the ways in which humans cognize space and internally represent                 environments.  This research project poses the question of                      whether a cognitive representation of space is an internalized                  geographic information system.  It will determine the degree to                 which selected processes involved in compiling and using GIS are                similar to those involved in compiling and using cognitive maps.                Emphasis will be placed on the type of reasoning and the                        inference required in both cognitive mapping and GIS and on how                 such processes can be understood and interpreted by people.                     Experiments will be designed to evaluate human competence in                    performing such activities as recognizing adjacency,                            connectivity, network membership, path selection criteria,                      conducting analysis and compilation of overlay and compression                  procedures, and undertaking neighborhood delineation and                        regionalization activities.  It is not well understood how humans               perform these activities nor what types of errors arise when                    performing them.                                                                     Interdisciplinary research on spatial behavior by                          psychologists, cognitive scientists, roboticists, artificial                    intelligence engineers and transport modelers is increasing                     rapidly.  Behavioral research into the design and use of                        geographic information systems and on such topics as                            visualization of spatial information, development of user                       interfaces and user friendly representation modes can help                      software and data base developers improve communication,                        analysis, and understanding with GIS.  This project will identify               theoretical and practical links between the processes of spatial                cognition used generally in spatial knowledge acquisition and the               spatial processing and analysis components which form the basis                 of many geographical information systems.",
