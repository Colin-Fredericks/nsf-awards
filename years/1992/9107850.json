 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program investigates the physical origin                          of waveguide-mode-enhanced molecular fluorescence,                              a phenomenon first reported by the Principal                                    Investigator and one of his former Ph.D. students                               (who jointly hold a patent on this process) in 1985.                            The patent has attracted the interest of the medical                            diagnostics industry.  The term enhanced fluorescence                           refers to the substantial increase in the fluorescent                           signal emitted by a layer of molecules deposited onto                           a suitably prepared substrate compared to that from                             the same quantity of molecules deposited onto an                                unprepared substrate.  In essence, a glass substrate                            can be dramatically improved as a substrate for                                 molecular fluorescence by overcoating it with the                               proper combination of layers.  Both optical scattering                          and optical waveguide modes contribute to the                                   observed enhancement.  The research attempts to                                 develop a theoretical model of the enhancement                                  process and to verify the predictions of the model                              through additional experiments.  A proper                                       quantitative description of the enhancement process                             will identify the optical properties of the sample that                         achieve the greatest enhancement.                                                                                                                               The proposed theoretical work applies to several                                other aspects of the dipole-surface problem important                           for optoelectronics, namely quantum-well vertical-                              cavity lasers and suppressed spontaneous emission.                              these problems are to be examined, but the primary                              emphasis of the research is waveguide-mode-                                     enhanced molecular fluorescence.",
