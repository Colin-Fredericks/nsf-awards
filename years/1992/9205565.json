 "awd_abstract_narration": "The E75 ecdysone inducible gene, believed to be a key regulator                 of ecdysone triggered genetic hierarchies in Drosophila                         development, encodes three different protein products which are                 members of the steroid receptor superfamily and which share                     conserved structural features corresponding to the DNA and                      hormone binding domains. Genetic analysis shows that these                      proteins carry out distinct functions at different stages of                    development. The E75 A protein has been localized                               immunocytochemically to the chromosomal sites of many ecdysone                  regulated genes, including E75. In functional studies, this                     protein has been shown to be capable of negatively regulating its               own promoter. The similarity of E75 sequences to the hormone                    binding domains of known receptor suggests that E75 is also a                   receptor. This hypothesis is supported by evolutionary comparison               and preliminary functional analysis of the putative hormone                     binding domain. No known steroid, thyroid, retinoid hormone or                  insect juvenile hormone activates the E75 proteins, suggesting                  that the E75 ligand is a previously unidentified hormone. In the                studies propose here, these observations will be extended to                    further define the role of the different E75 proteins and the                   putative E75 ligand in the regulation of gene expression and                    Drosophila development. Studies will be focused in three areas:                 1) developmental genetic analysis of E75 to further define the                  mutant phenotypes, to understand the role of each of the E75                    proteins in the generation of these phenotypes and the role of                  different E75 domains involved in the repression and activation                 of target genes, 2) characterization of its role in development,                and 3) characterization of target gene regulation by                            developmentally characterized E75 mutant proteins.",
