Castellani of the Chemistry                   Department, Marshall University.  Pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl                   complexes of (1) chromium and iron phosphines and isocyanides                   and of (2) zirconium (IV) oxides and sulfides, and related                      niobium and tantalum hydrides, will be prepared.  Reactivity of                 the electron-deficient radical species produced is expected to                  be reduced by the introduction of the bulky pentaphenyl-                        cyclopentadienyl group.  These compounds are of interest                        because they serve as models for radical intermediates that                     have been proposed for many catalytic and organometallic                        reactions.  Once prepared, the catalytic activity and                           mechanisms of substitution reactions of these compounds will be                 explored and implications for analogous reactions drawn.                        %%%                                                                             Highly reactive species important in catalytic processes are                    not easily characterized, but this project allows determination                 of the reactivity of closely-related species.  The findings                     have implications for catalyst development and sensor                           technology.  The research will be carried out by undergraduate                  students.",
