 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, Professor James J. Valentini of                      Columbia University will study the state-to-state dynamics of                   photodissociation and photo-induced reactions in van der Waals                  and hydrogen-bonded molecular complexes.  The research                          addresses the influence of many-body interactions, solvent                      effects, cage effects, mode-selective or bond-selective                         chemistry, and steric effects in these reactions.  The clusters                 will be excited to a specific vibrational mode via stimulated                   Raman excitation, and photofragments or reaction products will                  be detected using laser-induced fluorescence or multiphoton                     ionization.                                                                     %%%                                                                             The study of molecular complexes which are held together with                   bonds which are weaker than chemical bonds impacts our                          understanding of many phenomena.  For example, the way solids                   and liquids are formed from condensing vapors or the conditions                 under which certain surfaces catalyze chemical reactions are                    governed by the physical forces that hold the separate chemical                 species together.  An understanding of the role of these forces                 in weakly bound complexes is a major goal of this current                       project.",
