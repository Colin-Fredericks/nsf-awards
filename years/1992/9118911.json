 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years evidence has been accumulating that many                        enzymes proceed through radical mechanisms.  Most reactions                     involve redox cofactors for which radical intermediates are                     plausible based on model studies of cofactor chemistry.  New                    types of mechanisms have been proposed recently involving                       radicals on amino acid side chains.  Although there has been                    much compelling indirect evidence consistent with H-atom                        abstraction from substrates by protein-derived radicals, to                     date there has been no direct evidence.  Galactose oxidase from                 the fungus Dactylium dendroides catalyzes the oxidation of                      primary alcohols with O2, producing aldehydes and H2O2.  Based                  on recent EPR, resonance Raman, and X-ray crystallographic                      structural information and on extensive preliminary studies                     with mechanism-based inactivating substrate analogs, a new                      mechanism for galactose oxidase catalysis is proposed featuring                 rate-determining H-atom abstraction by a tyrosine radical from                  the alcohol CH2.  The reaction mechanism of galactose oxidase                   catalysis will be studied in the proposal research.  The                        resulting detailed reaction mechanism should become a paradigm                  for substrate activation using protein-centered radicals for H-                 atom abstraction from substrates.  Such fundamental information                 will be useful in understanding more biomedically relevant                      enzymes, such as ribonucleotide reductases, which are more                      difficult to study due to stringent substrate specificities.",
