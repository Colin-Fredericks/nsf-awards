 "awd_abstract_narration": "The time immediately following the metamorphosis and settlement                 of benthic organisms is critical to their ability to become part                of the existing community.  Because of their small size and                     simpler morphology, juveniles endure more intense interactions                  with a wider spectrum of species.  In addition, tremendous                      changes in the ecological relationships between species can occur               between life-history stages and the importance of these study                   will focus on the settling and juvenile stages of 7 dominant                    species within subtidal marine epifaunal communities along the                  coast of southern New England.  The study sites chosen exhibit                  extreme (1 to 2 orders of Magnitude) differences in larval                      settlement, and each has a distinct group of dominant species.                  Experiments will be conducted to test processes that predation to               recruitment, i.e. differences in larval settlement and examine                  how relationships change with life-stage.  The importance of any                event occurring during juvenile life-history stages will be                     judged relative to phenomena occurring during larval settlement                 and within the adult community.",
