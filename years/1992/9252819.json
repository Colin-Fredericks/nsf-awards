Program activities                            include:  1) instruction in geometry, probability, and                          statistics in experimental mode with emphasis on scientific                     research methodology, supplemented with problem-solving,                        problem-solving techniques, the graphic calculator and                          computer usage; 2) enrichment experiences such as study                         skills and writing for success in mathematics; alleviation                      of mathematics anxiety; guest speakers who discuss career                       options in mathematics and local field trips to business and                    professional operations.  Parents play an active role by                        providing after school and weekend help for the student on                      the basis of their own program orientation training.                            Follow-up activities include minds-on, hands-on activities                      developed and presented by students using the skills and                        techniques acquired during the summer program as well as                        additional classroom-laboratory activities.",
