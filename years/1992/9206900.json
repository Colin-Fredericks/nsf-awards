 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research into providing highly reusable and                           maintainable components by using automatic software synthesis                   techniques uses domain knowledge combined with automatic                        software synthesis architecture that specifically                               incorporates application-specific knowledge.  This                              architecture synthesizes software to meet a behavioral                          specification and external interaction design constraints.                      Some examples of these external constraints are communication                   protocols, precisions, timing and space limitations.  The                       incorporation of application-specific knowledge facilitates                     the generation of mathematical software metrics which can be                    used to narrow the design space, thereby making software                        synthesis tractable.  The use of knowledge sources to make                      software synthesis tractable and the organization of this                       knowledge are paramount.  First, an application-specific                        domain is chosen that will benefit greatly from having highly                   reusable and maintainable components.  One such domain is                       real-time software applications.  Second, the application-                      independent software synthesis architecture is targeted to                      this real-time software domain beginning from the lowest level                  of abstraction (e.g., application-specific code generation) up                  to higher levels of abstraction (e.g., system resource                          allocation).  The primary goal is to maintain focus on the                      final result:  software.  Third, the application-independent                    software synthesis architecture is expanded to include                          knowledge of the platform.  An example is a RISC processor                      running the Real-Time MACH operating system.                                         This research will result in the development of use-                       specific knowledge representations and a new characterization                   of software design from a synthesis perspective.  Success has                   the potential to dramatically reduce system life-cycle costs                    not only by reducing development time, but more importantly                     facilitating maintenance, modifications and extensions of                       software systems which are currently dominating system life-                    cycle costs.",
