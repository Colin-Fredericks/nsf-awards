 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with a workshop on High Performance                  Computing and Communications (HPCC) for Grand Challenge                         Applications - Vision, Natural Language and  Speech Processing,                 and Artificial Intelligence.  This workshop will bring together                 22 invited experts from academia and industry, with the goal of                 identifying near-term and long term problems in supporting these                grand challenge application problems.  Many traditional results                 in these grand challenge applications involving vision, natural                 language and speech processing, and artificial intelligence were                developed without the availability of HPCC systems.  On the other               hand, computer architects design HPCC systems without considering               requirements in vision, natural language and speech processing,                 and artificial intelligence applications.  In this workshop, key                issues and potential approaches/research directions for the next                five to ten years will be identified, with the goal of answering                the following problems: (1) What are grand challenge applications               in vision, natural language and speech processing, and artificial               intelligence that can be benefited by the availability of HPCC                  systems?   (2) How should HPCC systems be designed so they can                  support grand challenge applications in these areas?  The                       interdisciplinary HPCC initiative has created a needed for                      infrastructure development and program planning.  The proposed                  meeting will bring together about 22 experts in the fields with                 representatives of NSF to discuss current research issues and                   formulate interdisciplinary research frameworks.  The goal of the               meeting is to produce a report describing those issues and                      frameworks which will then be disseminated to the research                      community.",
