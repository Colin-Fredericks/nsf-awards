 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principle investigator will continue his research on                   problems involving the interaction between combinatorics and                    algebra.  He will focus on two problems.  The first concerns new                conjectures arising from the principle investigator's application               of Kazhdan-Lusztig theory to a problem on combinatorial immanants               which assert that certain Hecke algebra virtual characters are                  polynomials with with non-negative, even unimodal, integer                      coefficients.  A combinatorial approach to these conjectures will               be sought, along with combinatorial interpretations of known                    non-negativity results in Kazhdan-Lusztig theory which now rest                 on difficult geometric machinery.  The second problem concerns                  the conjecture that the Shur function expansion of Macdonald's                  symmetric functions are polynomials with non-negative integer                   coefficients.                                                                        This project is on the interface between combinatorics and                 Lie algebra.  The principle investigator is concerned with                      certain polynomials which are combinatorially defined and have                  deep connections with structures in geometry and representation                 theory.  This work is important both in mathematics and physics.",
