The                   relation between adolescent functioning and family behaviors will               be examined with a two-phase sampling design.  The first phase is               an epidemiological survey of the relation between family                        processes and adolescent functioning in a community population of               adolescents from nine working-class, rural towns in New England.                The second phase selects for intensive study a subsample of 100                 families of adolescents chosen for their representativeness of                  the larger community population.  The adolescents in the larger                 community sample and the families from the subsample will be                    studied at two times points two years apart in order to examine                 longitudinal change.  The epidemiological survey phase tests                    hypotheses about the relation of family factors to adolescent                   outcome in a large, well-defined population.  The intensive study               of the representative subsample delineates specific family                      behavior patterns that are associated with varying longitudinal                 trajectories of adolescent adaptation.  This intensive second                   phase uses methods of direct observation of family behavior                     patterns as well as standardized questionnaires and tests to                    assess all family members' functioning.  This research will                     increase our understanding of the relationship between adolescent               functioning and family behaviors.",
