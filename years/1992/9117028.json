 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two technology trends strongly impacting the design and               performance of I/O systems.  First, processor power, especially for             single (or few) chip designs, is increasing very rapidly, leading to:           (a) (almost) corresponding increases in I/O load, (b) distributed               systems with workstations (w/wo local disks), file servers and                  computation nodes, and (c) multiprocessors with enormous                        cost/performance advantages over uniprocessors providing the same               aggregate performance.  Second, disk storage densities are increasing           rapidly without any comparable increase in disk performance.  A number          of design and optimization problems have become extremely important             due to these trends: (a) Systems are becoming increasingly susceptible          to I/O bottlenecks due to increasing I/O rates and the less quickly in          creasing ability of the I/O system to respond to them.  (b)                     Multiprocessor systems with shared I/O devices and/or databases are             increasingly susceptible to I/O bottlenecks in referencing, locking             and updating shared data.                                                                                                                                       This project continues research on a number of topics relating to               file, I/O and database system performance.  These include: (a)                  Development and analysis of algorithms for disk caching in distributed          and hierarchical systems, taking into account both consistency and              performance.  (b) Studies of the effect of disk caching in conjunction          with disk striping and log structured file systems.  (c) Analysis and           development of locking algorithms for shared, distributed database              systems.  (d) Design, optimization and implementation of hierarchical           and distributed file migration in a very large mass storage systems             using optical disks to be built at UC Berkeley.  The work relies                heavily on actual system measurement and trace driven simulation.",
