 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports work on several aspects of ionospheric                 and magnetospheric physcis.  Turbulence models developed for the                equatorial ionosphere will be extended to the more complex                      geometry of the polar ionosphere.  The density gradient along the               polar magnetic field is likely to make the turbulence in the                    polar ionosphere more 3-dimensional rather than 2-dimensional                   considered earlier.  This is borne out by observations of the                   radar backscattered spectrum of the irregularities in the polar                 ionosphere.     In addition, work will be done on the anomolous                 heating of electrons reported in the polar ionosphere.  Because                 of the high electric fields present in the polar ionosphere                     existing theories developed by the PI and others require  re-                   examination to include nonlinear effects.  A third project will                 address renormalization group analysis of drift-wave and E x B                  turbulance.  A powerful tool employing renormalization group                    analysis (RNG) has been recently developed  for the study of                    fully developed turbulence.  One of the important applications                  is the derivation of exact algorithms for subgrid modelling for                 numerical computation.  In any numerical computation of a set of                partial differenial equations for a problem on the geophysical                  scale length, the degrees of freedom are enormously large and                   freedom must be severely reduced for actual computation on even                 the largest supercomputers.  The central issue is how to make                   such a reduction without losing the essential physics.  In                      connection with another project the PI has already developed a                  RNG based subgrid model for Alfven wave turbulence.  For                        ionospheric physics, the PI is developing RNG based subgrid                     models for drift-wave turbulence and E x B turbulence prevalent                 in E and F regions.",
