 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this work is to understand how flame stretch and                    flame curvature affect premixed flame properties.  A laminar                    vortex will be created in an existing test apparatus and will                   be interacted with a laminar premixed flame.  Vortex                            conditions first will be chosen to represent a single eddy in                   a turbulent flow to show how strain and flame curvature affect                  the local burning velocity, the creation of pockets of                          unburned CO pollutants, flame extinction, and deviations from                   the \"laminar flamelet\" profiles of temperature and OH                           concentration.  Secondly, vortex conditions later will be                       chosen to represent the piston-generated vortex of an internal                  combustion engine and the vortex will be interacted with a                      centrally ignited flame kernel in order to understand kernel                    growth in a realistic strain field.  Thirdly, the measurements                  will be used to assess and improve a recent full Navier-Stokes                  CFD simulation of the laminar flame-vortex interaction, which                   forms the \"building block\" of future models and can provide a                   useful submodel for existing statistical models.  Operational                   diagnostics to be employed include Rayleigh scattering for                      temperature images and profiles, OH and NO fluorescence                         imaging, and PIV to image the two-dimensional strain field.                                                                                                     This study should provide information useful to a number of                     other research efforts in the area of turbulent premixed flame                  structures.  In particular, it should be of use in development                  of better simulations of flame-vortex interactions, leading to                  better understanding and modeling of critical processes                         affecting levels of production of carbon monoxide and oxides                    of nitrogen in devices such as internal combustion engines, in                  which flame-vortex interactions play a crucial role.  This in                   turn will lead to definition of design strategies for                           reduction of levels of these pollutants produced by such                        engines, an important national need.",
