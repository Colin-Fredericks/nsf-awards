 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to explore the                            interrelationships between the topology of a 3-manifold and the                 types of laminations and foliations it can support.  The                        investigator will look into the nature of group actions on the 2-               sphere and their extensions into the 3-ball.  The main questions                he plans to consider are the following.  (1) If M is irreducible,               N is laminated, and M and N are homotopy equivalent, are they                   homeomorphic?  (2) If M is laminated, then are homotopic                        homeomorphisms isotopic?  (3) What manifolds have essential                     laminations?  (4) If G is a 2-sphere convergence group which                    extends to a properly discontinuous action on the 3-ball, is that               extension unique up to conjugation?                                                  The study of 3-dimensional manifolds is aided by the fact                  that our experience of living in such a space endows us with a                  strong intuition for what can and cannot take place.  Studying                  the topology of higher dimensional manifolds is necessarily                     dependent upon the algebraic machinery available to assist in it,               but in 3 dimensions we also have at our disposal a direct avenue                of perception.  It is therefore surprising to learn that some                   questions that have natural generalizations to higher dimensions                have been answered already for these higher cases, while the 3-                 dimensional case that inspired them remains obdurately                          unassailable.  There is a classical conjecture of Poincare about                spheres that is the most notorious example of this phenomenon.                  What appears to be at work in thus violating our natural over-                  estimate of the advantage that geometric intuition should confer                in 3 dimensions?  It is at least partly a naive faith in                        intuition and mistrust of computation, but it is also the fact                  that the known methods of computation perform best with the                     luxury of excess dimensions in which to maneuver.  They are                     somehow cramped in the presence of only three dimensions.  In                   this setting one can see that the investigator's exploitation of                laminations as a tool particularly adapted to the 3-dimensional                 environment and our intuition about it constitutes a welcome and                enormously promising development.",
