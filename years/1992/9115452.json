 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of New Mexico operates the Sevilleta Field                  Station in central New Mexico at a site adjacent to the Sevilleta               National Wildlife Refuge, the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife               Refuge, the Sierra Ladrones Wilderness Study Area, and the                      Magdalena Mountains Research Area in the Cibola National Forest.                Habitats in these areas range from desert to montane forests, and               there are dozens of active research projects based at the                       Sevilleta Field Station.  Among these are many NSF-supported                    projects, including a Long-Term Ecological Research Site and a                  Research Experience for Undergraduates Site.  Dr. Clifford                      Crawford, Director of the Station, proposes to install a                        microwave link between the microcomputers at the Station and the                computing facilities at the main campus.  He also plans to                      install a remote weather station with a radio link for data                     transmission, and to acquire many essential pieces of laboratory                and field research equipment.                                                        The proposed additions to the Sevilleta FIeld Station will                 add significantly to the Station's capacity to host diverse                     research projects.  This Station offers research support in a                   remote but unique setting, and has demonstrated its ability to                  facilitate outstanding research.",
