 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) from methylotrophic bacteria                   contains tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TQQ) as the essential redox              cofactor.  TTQ is biosynthesized by in situ transformation of 2                 tryptophyl residues in the small subunit of MADH.  MADH from                    bacterium W3A1 (MADHw) has unusual spectral properties.  The UV-                visible spectrum is very sensitive to the presence of the                       monovalent cations Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, NH4+, (CH3)3NH+ and (CH3)4N+.        NH4+ interacts with MADH in a biphasic manner, the binding of which             can serve as a model for the enzyme's initial interaction with the              substrate, CH3NH3+.                                                             Research aims are: 1.  Study the cation interactions in more detail             by UV-visivle and resonance Raman spectroscopy, and by steady-state             kinetic analysis.  2.  Begin work on the comparison of the basic                properties of MADHw and MADH from Methylobacterium extorquen sp.                AM1 (MADHA) to establish the similarities/differences for 2 major               subclasses of this enzyme.  3.  Initiate steady-state kinetic                   studies of the interaction of MADHW and its physiological electron              acceptors.  4.  Attempt to obtain the x-ray structure of MADHA.  5.             Endeavor to obtain the structures of the enzyme an isoform in                   complex with their physiological electron acceptors.  6.  Using the             MADH structures, chose amino acids for site-specific mutation.  The             mutants will be used to elucidate the mechanism of substrate                    oxidation, electron transfer, cation binding, enviromental                      interactions, etc.  7.  Conduct some experiments that should shed               light on the mechanism of biosynthesis of the cofactor in MADH.                 %%%                                                                             The enzyme methylamine dehydrogenase is isolated from numerous soil             bacterial classified as methylotrophs.  The enzyme converts                     methylamine (CH3NH2 to formaldehyde and ammonia, and the organism               uses these as the only carbon and nitrogen source for growth.  In               order to carry out the conversion of methylamine, the enzyme                    contains an essential factor (the coenzyme) that is formed by                   modification and crosslinking of two specific amino acids units                 (tryptophans) in the enzyme.  The absorption of visible light                   (i.e., the color) of the enzyme-bound coenzyme is changed on                    addition of any of several positively charged ions.  Among these                are the ions of lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium,                   ammonia and trimethylamine \u0131<CH3)3N!.  Studying this phenomenon in              more detail will provide essential information regarding how the                enzyme is able to convert methylamine to formaldehyde and ammonia.              Research aims are: 1.  Study the ion interactions in more detail by             several spectroscopic method, and investigate how the ions affect               the rate at which the enzyme converts methylamine.  2.  Begin work              on the comparison of the basic properties of two, somewhat                      different forms of methylamine dehydrogenase from different                     bacteria.  3.  Initiate studies of the interaction of methylamine               dehydrogenase with other proteins that are required for the                     conversion of methylamine.  4. Obtain and refine the 3-demensional              structure of two forms of methylamine dehydrogenase, and the                    structures of these when bound to other proteins.  5. Using these               structures, chose amino acids for site-specific mutation (i.e., the             selective substitution of specific amino acid in the protein by                 another amino acid).  The mutant forms will be used to elucidate                how the enzyme functions on a molecular level.   6. Conduct some                experiments that should shed light on the mechanism of conversion               of two tryptophan groups into the essential coenzyme.",
