 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in civil engineering between Reidar Bjorhovde of the University                 of Pittsburgh and Andre Colson of the Ecole Normale Superieure                  de Cachan, France.  The project addresses a central issue in the                analysis and design of steel structures; specifically, the reliability          of semi-rigid connections of structural frames.  The investigators              will perform studies on a variety of structures from simple low-                rise to multistory high-rise buildings to industrial structures.  The           objective is to establish criteria for determining the behavior of a            variety of framework connections.  They will develop models                     which reflect the random nature of connection elements.  Dr.                    Bjorhovde brings to this collaboration significant experience in                steel research and probabilistic methods of analysis and design.                This is complemented by the French investigator's expertise in                  deterministic studies on the strength and behavior of steel                     structures for semi-rigid connectors.                                                                                                                           This research will provide complete data and a new methodology                  for the deterministic and probabilistic behavior of semi-rigid                  connections.  The results could foster the use of semi-rigid                    connections by designers in the United States and lead to cost-                 effective designs and improved safety of steel structures.",
