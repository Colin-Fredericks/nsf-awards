 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this RUI project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry                      Program of the Chemistry Division, Craig will use FTIR                          spectroscopy to obtain structures of several small, non-polar                   organic molecules.  He will analyze the rotationally resolved                   IR spectra of the trans isomers and their isotopic species of                   several molecules which have higher electronic energies than                    their respective cis isomers.  The structures will be compared                  with those of the cis isomers and will provide data for                         comparison with ab initio calculations.  High resolution                        infrared spectra will be recorded on a spectrometer at the                      National Institute for Standards and Technology in the                          laboratory of Dr. Walter J. Lafferty.                                           %%%                                                                             There is a curious phenomenon called the \"cis effect\" in                        molecules with large substituent groups (which we will call X                   and Y) at either end of a rigid, planar carbon-carbon                           double-bonded skeleton, for example, HXC=CYH.  In such                          molecules the isomeric structure in which the two large (X and                  Y) groups are on the same side (in the \"cis\" or near position)                  is energetically more stable than the structure in which the                    large groups are on opposite corners of the molecule (in the                    \"trans\" position).  Intuitively, one would expect that the                      \"cis\" structure would be less stable energetically because the                  large groups can interfere with each other more readily.  This                  current project will acquire data which will allow theoretical                  studies to be compared with experimental structures in order to                 test the validity of the theoretical models.  It is expected                    that a successful theory will help explain this curious \"cis                    effect\" anomaly.",
