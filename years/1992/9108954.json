 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to the marked interest in global climate change over                the past few years, the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) at Stanford                 University initiated a multi-year study focusing primarily on the               likely energy sector impacts (costs and fuel mix effects) of                    initiatives that would constrain greenhouse gas emissions.  Like                previous EMF studies, this effort is geared to understanding what               the current set of models can contribute to understanding the                   nature and costs of these impacts as well as the comparative                    strengths and weaknesses of the various modeling paradigms that                 are currently being used to help develop policy in this area.                   Since the focus of this study is on providing information that                  can improve policy making over the next few years, it is largely                being funded by applied-research oriented organizations like the                Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the                  Electric Power Research Institute, and a group of leading                       domestic and international companies.  The contribution of this                 project comes in carefully linking what comes out of this study                 to basic research needs in the social sciences.  This project                   will tie the key policy analysis issues identified during the                   study directly to the type of basic social science research that                NSF has and will continue to support.  The preliminary                          conclusions regarding the implications of the EMF study for                     research priorities will be summarized in a report and the report               will be discussed at a workshop convened by the EMF.                                                                                                            More specifically, the linkages between the more application-                   oriented main EMF study and this project would include an                       assessment of the relevant merits of additional basic research on               such topics as demographics, economic growth determinants,                      structural shifts in economic activity, the determinants of                     energy demand, technical change, and the private sector R&D                     response to price changes and policy implementations to the key                 policy issues in global environmental change.",
