 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental investigation of epitaxial growth and analysis of the             properties of SiGeC will be conducted to assess the viability of                obtaining strain compensation in SiGe by incorporation of 1 to 2                atomic percent carbon into CVD-grown layers of SiGeC, and thereby               raise the energy band gap.  In the binary alloy, the presence of                about 10 atomic percent Ge in Si introduces strain and lowers the               energy gap; in contrast, the addition of only 1 to 2 percent carbon             in SiGe is expected to compensate the strain and raise the energy               gap. If this is feasible, and the material is thermally stable to               temperatures of 950C, it may be possible to fabricate a wide range              of structures and advanced devices through band gap engineering of              Si/SiGe/SiGeC heterostructures analogous to what has been                       successfully demonstrated with compound semiconductors, which would             represent an important advance in microelectronics.                             %%%                                                                             This research will investigate epitaxial crystal growth of silicon              germanium carbon alloys to understand basic materials properties,               and to assess the possibility of controlling the energy band gap of             Si/SiGe/SiGeC heterostructures for utilization of this material in              a wide range of advanced silicon-based devices.  The ternary alloy,             SiGeC, holds the potential of superior device and circuit                       capability while simplifying process integration.",
