 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase (3-sn-phosphatidate                              phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.4) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae             catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PA to form diacylglycerol and Pi.            PA phsophatase plays a role in the regulation of phospholipid and               triacylglycerol synthesis in S. cerevisiae.  Two membrane-                      associated forms (45-kDa and 104-kDa) of PA phosphatase have been               purified and characterized in our laboratory.  In this grant                    application we propose to initiate a project to clone the                       structural genes for the 45-kDa and 104-kDa forms of PA                         phosphatase.  We will use specific antibodies to the enzymes and                lambda-ZAP cDNA expression and lambda-DASH genomic expression                   libraries.  The cloned genes will be characterized and the                      essential nature of PA phosphatase will be addressed.                           %%%                                                                             The enzyme phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase in the yeast                          Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyzes the removal of phosphate from                the phospholipid PA to form the neutral lipid diacylglycerol.  This             enzyme plays a role in the control of overall lipid synthesis in                yeast and in animal cells.  Two membrane-associated forms (45-kDa               and 104-kDa) of PA phosphatase have been purified and characterized             in our laboratory.  In this grant application we propose to                     initiate a project to isolate the genes which encode for the 45-kDa             and 104-kDa forms of PA phosphatase.  We will use specific                      antibodies to the enzymes and DNA expression libraries in lambda                viruses.  Once isolated the genes for these enzymes will be                     characterized.  The essential nature and role of these genes in                 yeast lipid synthesis and cell growth will be examined.",
