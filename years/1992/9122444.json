 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continuing support for the establishment and                operation of the neutron scattering user facility located at NIST               in the Cold Neutron Guide Hall.  The project is funded jointly by               NSF and NIST.  Instrumentation well suited to the neutron                       scattering community will offer a balanced cross section of                     advanced neutron scattering instrumentation for high resolution                 studies of the microstructure and dynamics of virtually all classes             of materials.                                                                                                                                                   Instruments available to users will include a small-angle neutron               scattering (SANS) spectrometer with polarized beam capability, and              a spin inelastic neutron scattering (SPINS) spectrometer using                  supermirror polarizers and a \"Drabkin\" flipper.  The SPINS                      spectrometer can potentially achieve an order of magnitude                      improvement in energy resolution over conventional triple-axis                  spectrometers, which would open up new opportunities in the study               of low energy excitation in condensed matter systems.  The SPINS                project is cost-shared equally (50/50) between NSF and NIST.  The               SANS instrument is expected to be fully utilized by researchers in              condensed matter physics, chemistry, biology and materials science              to obtain structural information on a scale size from 1 to nearly               500 nanomicrometers, on materials such as polymers, metal alloys,               ceramics, porous media structured fluids and gels, biological                   macromolecules and magnetic materials that in many cases cannot be              obtained by any other techniques.                                                                                                                               These instruments will provide state-of-the-art capability                      unequaled in this country, and will be competitive with the best                facilities worldwide.  The instruments will be operated in a user               mode.  Proposal review and selection will be by an external Program             Advisory Committee, with proposal selection being based on                      scientific merit of the projects proposed.//",
