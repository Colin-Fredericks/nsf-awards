 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research consists of four separate, but related empirical                  projects aimed at increasing our understanding of altruistic                    behavior and household saving.  The projects examine the                        relationship between monetary charitable contributions and                      volunteer labor supply; the degree to which private intrafamily                 transfers are affected by public transfers; the effects on                      household saving of the 1986 changes in the tax treatment of                    Individual Retirement Accounts; and the effects of borrowing                    constraints on household saving and the consumption of durables.                                                                                                The first study develops a theoretical model of household                       charitable behavior that yields several important empirical                     propositions.  These will be examined using data from both the                  1986 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and a new dataset on                     volunteerism.  The study of intrafamily transfers will be the                   first to examine existing theoretical models and the                            responsiveness of intrafamily transfers using data from the Panel               Study on Income Dynamics.  The third study will use the three-way               SCF panel to analyze the effects of statutory changes in                        deductible IRA contribution limits.  It will extend the authors'                previous work in this area.  The last project will investigate                  the duration of borrowing constraints and the effects of these                  constraints on household saving and the consumption of durables                 using the SCF panel.",
