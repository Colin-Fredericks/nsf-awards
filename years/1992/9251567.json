 "awd_abstract_narration": "The realism of computer graphics images increases with the                      development of new algorithms which model reality.  Such                        algorithms are now possible with the increasing power and                       affordability of computers.  Graphics is different from                         photography as it can create images which do not exist or                       cannot be photographed. For example, images of the rings of                     Saturn can be created from the data sent back from space probes                 and the interaction of atomic particles can be displayed from                   data developed on supercomputers. This project will continue                    work which animates the process of a system, the algorithm of                   a solution. Educational computer videos will be developed                       showing the steps in an algorithm or the progress of actions                    within a system. The videos will use state-of-the-art graphics                  tools such as photorealistic rendering and scientific                           visualization.  The project will also develop software tools to                 aid the process, and manuals to make the techniques accessible                  to others. Powerful color workstations which can support the                    use of these tools will be acquired as part of this project.",
