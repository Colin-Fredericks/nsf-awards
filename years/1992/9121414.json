 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cytochrome c-cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) system provides an               exceedingly rich opportunity to investigate the intimate details of             protein-protein interactions and long-range electron transfer                   between physiologically related heme proteins.  The objectives of               this research proposal lie in two areas.  This first area is to                 characterize the interaction between both horse and yeast iso-1                 cytochrome c with yeast CcP.  Experiments designed to clarify the               stoichiometry of binding between cytochrome c and CcP will be                   performed to determine if, and under what conditions, more than one             cytochrome c may bind to CcP. The high-affinity cytochrome c                    binding site on CcP will be mapped through site-directed                        mutagenesis.  The role of individual amino acids at the binding                 site will be assessed through thermodynamic measurements of the                 binding affinity.  The location of any secondary interaction sites              will also be determined through site-directed mutagenesis.  The                 second area of interest is to characterize electron transfer                    between the heme groups of cytochrome c and CcP.  Transient-state               kinetic techniques will be used to investigate the rate of electron             transfer from ferrocytochrome c to the oxidized intermediate of CcP             and the rate of redox equilibration between the heme iron and Trp-              191 in CcP compound II.  The specificity of the reaction dynamics               and the electron transfer pathway will be explored through site-                directed mutagenesis of CcP.                                                    %%%                                                                             This work should lead to a better understanding of protein-protein              recognition in general, and of heme proteins, which include                     hemoglobin and the proteins in energy metabolism, in particular",
