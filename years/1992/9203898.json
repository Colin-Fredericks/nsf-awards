Another exhibit is planned in years 2 and 3 of this project which               will travel to science and technology centers throughout the                    United States.  The goal is to bring to exhibit viewer to a                     better understanding of space science as a                                      comprehensive,interdisciplinary and exciting field of science.                  School children and the general public alike will be invited to                 experience space science as an approachable, creative activity                  through illustrating various facets of solar-terrestrial science                in scientifically sound yet captivating materials, including                    interactive media. The overarching theme of the exhibits will be                to clearly show the importance of the sun and its impact on our                 near-Earth environment.  Secondary themes emphasize that space is               not empty and can be very hazardous to people and technological                 systems; and that the entire geospace environment is highly                     coupled and interconnected.  Thus, these exhibits will focus on                 processes rather than just facts.",
