 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a five year program that provides 80 contact                    hours of workshops to 40 middle and high school biology teachers                each year. Participants are recruited primarily from schools with               over 75 percent enrollment of underrepresented students. Sessions               begin during the academic year and continue into a summer week-                 long session. During the workshops, teachers are updated in                     current advances in biological science and are provided with cost               effective, hands-on, investigative activities that convey state-                of-the-art concepts for use by all students. These activities,                  which feature cooperative learning, are easy to implement and                   cost effective. Teachers and their students may be invited to                   participate in university research laboratories in the Center for               Cancer & Developmental Biology.                                                                                                                                 Evaluation of the project includes pre and post testing of                      teachers and their students, examination of teacher authored                    lesson plans, and examination of student research projects and                  their inclusion in county science fairs.                                                                                                                        Project dissemination occurs through required inservice                         workshops, distribution of project products locally and                         nationally, through school curriculum guides, and through                       publication in national science teaching journals.                                                                                                              Cost sharing in the amount of $314,165 equals 72.5% of the NSF                  award.",
