 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Julius Rebek, Jr. at Massachusetts                 Institute of Technology.  Systems designed to precisely fix the                 positions of molecules in space in order to control their                       reactivity with neighboring molecules will be studied.  In                      particular, a previously reported self-replicating system will                  be examined in greater detail.  An imide-ester that can bind                    adenine, but not undergo internal acylation, will be used to                    shut down the intramolecular base pair components and promote                   exponential growth.  More lipophilic and soluble Kemp triacid                   imides will also be used so that the concentrations can be                      increased.  Proximity complexation in order to enhance the rate                 of amide formation between two nucleic acid components will                     also be examined.                                                               %%%                                                                             Self-replicating reactions in which the product acts as a                       template for its own formation will be studied.  Such systems                   stand at the interface of chemistry and biology, and provide                    models for selection, competition and mutation; the essential                   components of chemical evolution.  The synthesis of efficient                   replicators and the design of nucleic acid-like templates for                   the synthesis of peptide sequences will be undertaken.  These                   new molecules are expected to offer a link between today's                      biological structures and their prebiotic counterparts.",
