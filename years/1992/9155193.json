 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Vera Zdravkovich is a professor of chemistry at Prince                      George's Community College in Largo, Maryland.  She has                         spearheaded summer institutes for elementary teachers in the                    past, and she now proposes to expand these efforts                              significantly.  Dr. Zdravkovich has initiated collaborations                    among four of Maryland's community colleges, with the                           purpose of forming a network of science faculty members                         interested in improving pre-college science education.                          Eleven faculty members from Cecil Community College, Anne                       Arundel Community College, and Hagerstown Junior College                        will attend workshops together to become familiar with                          exemplary instructional materials and approaches to                             elementary science education.  These science faculty members                    will serve an internship at the 1992 summer teachers                            institute at Prince George's Community College.  Additional                     workshops held during the 1992-93 academic year will add 28                     science faculty members to the cadre of trained scientists,                     who will then plan and implement teacher enhancement                            institutes at their host institutions.                                                                                                                          Community colleges are strategically positioned for                             significant impact on pre-college science education.                            Interactions among their education and science faculties can                    catalyze important opportunities that have not emerged from                     research universities.  The proposed collaborations among                       Maryland's community colleges has the potential for                             substantial impact, and can serve as a model for other                          states.                                                                                                                                                         Cost sharing on this project amounts to 132% of the NSF                         contribution.",
