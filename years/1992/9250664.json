 "awd_abstract_narration": "The addition of fully automated scanning electron microscopy to                 the undergraduate  biology laboratories at North Hennepin                       Community College (NHCC) will make possible a level of science                  instruction at the lower-division that was, before this time,                   reserved only for upper-division and graduate students. Using                   an older, manually operated Scanning Electron Microscope(SEM),                  a pilot project with SEM applications for lower-division                        college students has demonstrated that SEM lab experiences                      generate a greater interest in and understanding of science                     subjects.  A fully automated, user friendly SEM will permit the                 following changes to be made in the Biology Department:  (1) A                  new course focusing on techniques in structual biology that                     includes a student research componen will be added; (2)                         students studying cell and molecular biology will have enhanced                 hands-on lab experience in the examination of cellular and                      tissue structure; (3) all students in introductory biology will                 have an opportunity for firsthand operation of a SEM -The                       experience itself and the micrographs produced will supplement                  other laboratory and lecture materials used for the study of                    intricate structures; and (4) laboratory demonstrations for                     visiting secondary school students and opportunities for                        research projects by visiting college and secondary school                      educators will increase.",
