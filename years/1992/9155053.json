The selected students will participate in classroom discussions                 about various sources of energy such as coal, gasoline, nuclear and             solar.  Through hands-on experiments they will learn about the                  basic properties of light and electricity; these concepts will be               used in understanding solar power.  They will perform several                   experiments to understand solar motors and solar cell efficiency.               Hands-on experiments will also be performed in environmental                    chemistry where students will learn about carbon dioxide gas                    emission, the greenhouse effect, ozone layer depletion and toxic                waste.  Principles and operations of computers (both PC and                     mainframe) along with BASIC programming skills will be developed.               Students will undertake research projects in physics and chemistry              and write research papers about their findings.",
