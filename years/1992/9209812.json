 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a  study of non-orthogonal multiaccess                    signalling schemes,  a generalization of the conventional                       orthogonal approach, in bandlimited and/or fading channels. These               signalling schemes are studied from the information theoretical                 viewpoint and  the work seeks the capacity regions , the ultimate               performance limit, of channels using these signalling strategies.               Moreover, the study will address the issue of designing signature               waveforms to achieve these performance limits, and attempts to                  establish relationships  between signature waveform design                      and multiuser coding theory.  Following fruitful analysis in the                code-division multiaccess (CDMA) channel, a special  case of                    non-orthogonal signalling schemes, the project suggests the                     extension of the work to include  the general model. It is hoped                to develop a unified theory in multiaccess signalling that                      includes  conventional signalling strategies as well as the                     recently developed CDMA scheme. This  approach will broaden                     understanding in multiuser communications and lead to innovative                designs in multiuser signalling.  Practically, the outcomes of                  this project are likely to play an important role in mobile                     communications where bandwidth efficient multiaccess signalling                 strategies are crucial for development.",
