 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for study of an extracellular, calcium-                     dependent receptor which binds the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan                 (HA) in liver endothelial cells. HA is a component of extra-                    cellular matrix, and is involved in cell migration, cell division,              tissue organization, and development. One major and two minor poly-             peptides have been tentatively identified as the HA receptor using              modified HA which has been radioiodinated. The putative receptor                will be purified using standard biochemical techniques, the oligo-              saccharide specificity will be determined, and polyclonal or mono-              clonal antibodies will be produced. The antibodies will then be                 used to localize the receptor in various cell types. Properties of              this receptor will also be compared to the calcium-independent HA               receptor, which is involved in binding and endocytosis of HA.                   %%%                                                                             One component of the matrix surrounding cells is a polysaccharide               called hyaluronan (HA). It is involved in development, tissue                   organization, cell division, and cell migration. Endothelial cells              have a receptor which is involved in removal of HA from the                     circulation. This proposal is to study the properties of a second               HA receptor which was recently discovered. Standard biochemical                 techniques will be used to purify the protein, and antibodies will              be prepared so the location of the receptor in various cell types               can be studied. The mechanisms controlling the interaction between              extracellular matrix and endothelial cells will be examined.",
