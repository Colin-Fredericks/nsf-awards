 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal goal of the Summer Undergraduate Research                    Program in Nuclear Physics at the Indiana University Cyclotron                  Facility is to provide promising undergraduate physics majors                   with a meaningful, exiting and challenging experience in                        scientific research.  Fifteen students per year will be                         involved in experimental and theoretical research projects at                   IUCF and the Nuclear Theory Center for 10-week summer terms in                  the 3-year period 1992-94.  The students will be recruited                      from colleges and institutions throughout the U.S., with                        preference to institutions within the Midwest as well as small                  institutions where research opportunities for undergraduates                    may be limited.  It is expected that 90% of the students will                   come from institutions other than Indiana University at                         Bloomington, and that at least 25% of the students will be                      women.  The participants will gain direct research experience                   by working on projects in nuclear physics, nuclear chemistry                    and accelerator physics, under the supervision of faculty                       members and senior scientific staff.  Special programs for the                  students will be arranged, including orientation sessions,                      weekly seminars on current research in physics, and a machine                   shop mini-course.  At the end of the summer term, the students                  will submit research papers based on their work, and present                    the results in seminars at a closing symposium.",
