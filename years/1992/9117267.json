Results included the application of                       findings to development of a short-term, bioassay                               procedure for determination of heavy metal toxicity in                          environmental media.                                                            Objectives of this project include efforts to increase the                      sensitivity of the biosensing procedure by altering the                         permeability of the test-organism's cell wall.  Work will                       include efforts to simplify the conduct of the procedure                        that would enhance its potential for routine use in                             improving operation of biowastewater treatment processes,                       investigate its potential for use in bioassays to                               distinguish between heavy metal and organic toxicants, and                      in evaluation of heavy-metal toxicity associated with                           contaminants associated with solid substances such as                           sediments, soils, sludges and ash from incineration                             processes.                                                                                                                                                      Results of this research are expected to be utilized in                         the  engineering design of biological treatment processes                       that are subjected to being impacted by toxicants, in                           assessing the impacts of waste discharges to the                                environment, in determining the impacts of toxicants on                         potential water reuse for agricultural and industrial                           purposes, and in evaluating results of bio-, chemical-,                         and physical- procedures that are applied to remediation                        of hazardous waste sites.",
