 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project were (1) test the eolian/pedogenic accretionary                model of desert pavement formation by cosmogenic 3He exposure age               dating at selected study sites in the Mojave Desert and Great Basin             of western North America and in the Atacama Desert of South                     America; (2) elucidate the types of pedogenic (e.g., vesicular A                horizon formation), physical (e.g.,soil deformation and particle                movement) and biological (e.g., clast displacement due to plant                 growth) processes operating on and modifying pavements by field and             laboratory investigations; and (3) establish a potential                        terrestrial analog for planetary studies of ancient Martian                     regolith development.  Initial cosmogenic 3He surface exposure ages             on clasts from pavements developed on basaltic lava flow surfaces               confirm that clasts have remained at the pavement surface since the             eruption of the lava flow.  Traditional and experimental methods                of soil deformation and clast movement in 3-D space will be                     accomplished at selected study plots using subsurface and surface               measurements.  These data sets will be compared with (1) soil                   profile properties and development within the study plots, (2)                  chemical weathering parameters on clasts from the pavement and at               various levels within the subsurface, and (3) plant transect and                trench data showing relations between plant distribution and                    pavement properties and bioturbation and clast concentrations in                the eolian accretionary mantle.  This research will help the                    endeavors of field geologists who use pavements for mapping                     purposes, geomorphologists and geochronologists who use pavements               for dating landscapes, archaeologists who examine cultural artifact             distribution on pavements, Quaternary geologists who reconstruct                paleoenvironments of land surfaces in desert regions of the world,              and planetary geologists who seek terrestrial analogs for the                   evolution of the Martian regolith.",
