 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal coordinated by James V. Beck, Michigan State                      University and Oleg M. Alifanov, Moscow Aviation Institute                      sponsors a workshop on inverse problems in heat transfer.                       Nine American researchers from diverse universities will                        join the Russian group in East Lansing, Michigan in June                        1992.  Some French researchers may join them under                              separate funding.                                                                                                                                               Inverse problems in heat transfer provide an essential                          link between advanced experiments and analysis (including                       finite difference/element methods).  Several joint                              projects might result that could be applied to the study                        of ablation, combustion of solids, cooking of meat and                          other foods, bioengineering heat transfer investigations,                       processing of thermoset composite materials, and                                manufacturing and machining processes, to name only a few.                      Most of the proposed workshop participants attended a                           conference September 1990 in the USSR and a joint paper is                      currently in progress.  The proposed workshop has the                           potential of multiplying the individual and national                            efforts in inverse problems in heat transfer, which are                         important links between experiments and analysis.                                                                                                               This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the United States and Russia to combine complementary                           efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual                              interest and competence in the field of basic scientific                        research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and                             mutuality of benefit.",
