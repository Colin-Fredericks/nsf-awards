 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports visits over two years by                                    Dr. Richard Emlet of the University of Oregon                                   to the laboratory of Dr. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg of                                  the University of Sydney.  The research will                                    examine the fluid-mechanical and physiological                                  changes that are associated with modification                                   of development in the Australian echinoid genus                                 Heliocidaris and other genera of sea urchins.                                   The research will compare larvae of the                                         congeners H. tuberculata and H. erythrogramma                                   which live in the same latitude and environment                                 thus minimizing measurable differences between                                  related species for reasons unrelated to                                        developmental changes.  The research will                                       involve measurements of ciliary morphology and                                  kinematics, swimming behavior and metabolic                                     rates.  Results are expected to show whether                                    and how changes in morphology influence                                         swimming performance in the species with                                        modified development. The morphology of the                                     non-feeding larva will permit a determination                                   of the energetic cost of locomotion in a larval                                 metagoan.                                                                                                                                                       This research combines the strengths of the                                     U.S.-Australian scientists to allow them to                                     investigate how changes in development are                                      manifested in morphological and physiological                                   performance.  Dr. Emlet has expertise in the                                    evolution of echinoid larval development and                                    fluid mechanics of microscopic organisms.  HIs                                  Australian colleague brings expertise in                                        metabolic physiology and has developed new                                      technology for measuring oxygen consumption in                                  growing planktonic organisms.  Seven of the                                     fourteen lineages of sea urchin larvae that                                     have evolved nonfeeding development are                                         represented along the coasts of Australia.",
