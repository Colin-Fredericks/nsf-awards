 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structures of a number of helical plant viruses will be                     determined at resolutions sufficient to describe the intact                     viruses in molecular detail, using the fiber diffraction methods                already used successfully in this laboratory for tobacco mosaic                 virus (TMV) and the U2 strain of TMV.  The viruses to be studied                include viruses distantly related to TMV (cucumber green mottle                 mosaic virus and ribgrass mosaic virus), and the unrelated                      potexvirus papaya mosaic virus (PMV).  The structure of the                     isolated coat protein of PMV will be determined                                 crystallographically.  Mutants of TMV, predicted from the                       structure to be deficient in assembly or disassembly, will be                   designed here and made by collaborators.  Their assembly and                    disassembly properties will be studied here by electron                         microscopy and other measurements.  Structures of mutants showing               significantly changed assembly properties will be determined.                   %%%                                                                             These rod-shaped viruses are the only viruses in which the entire               nucleic acid genome can be seen using x-ray diffraction methods.                Studies of their structures are important to understanding                      protein-nucleic acid interactions and the processes of molecular                assembly and recognition in biological systems.  Assembly and                   recognition are essential steps in many cellular processes, as                  well as in the processes of viral infection and propagation.  The               studies proposed here are therefore relevant to a wide variety of               cellular systems of both medical and agricultural importance.",
