 "awd_abstract_narration": "For Einstein, principles of covariance were the essence of his                  special and general theories of relativity (1905 and 1915).  They               embodied the advances made by the theories.  The transition from an             aether theory with an absolute state of rest to special relativity              was effected through the requirement that the laws of special                   relativity must be covariant under Lorentz transformation.  Since               the Lorentz covariance of special relativity mapped inertial frames             of reference onto inertial frames of reference, the Lorentz                     covariance of special relativity, as presented in Einstein's                    celebrated 1905 paper, was sufficient to guarantee that the theory              satisfied the principle of relativity of inertial motion.  Dr.                  Norton is examining the history and development of principles of                covariance in relativity theory and their connection with                       relativity principles, Mach's principle and the principle of                    equivalence.  He is considering how the ideas in this whole area                have developed since Einstein's time and is tracing how the now                 standard modern view has come to disagree almost completely with                Einstein's own view--the view universally celebrated 70 years ago.              This study promises to present historians, philosophers and                     physicists with a synoptic view of the tangled and confusing                    developments of one of the most important problems in foundations               space and time theory.",
