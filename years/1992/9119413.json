 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flight is a truly distinctive locomotor mode:  it makes extreme                 demands on an organism's morphology and physiology, and produces                profound ecological and behavioral consequences.  In the hundreds               of millions of years that vertebrates have inhabited the earth,                 only three lineages have evolved the capability of sustained                    flight:  the extinct pterosaurs among reptiles; the birds; and                  within mammals, the (Order Chiroptera).  Perhaps because of the                 ecological opportunities available to nocturnal flying animals, the             success of bats has been extraordinary by any measure.  Today, bats             are more abundant than any other mammalian order in number of                   individuals and are second only to the rodents in number of                     species, with over 900 species of living bats described.                        Furthermore, bats are more widely distributed than any other                    mammals except humans and cetaceans (whales and porpoises).  Most               authors have attributed the tremendous evolutionary radiation of                bats to the key adaptive innovation of powered flight, even while               our understanding of this evolutionary transformation has remained              rudimentary.  Bats fly using wings that are clearly derived from                successive modifications of the primitive mammalian limb design,                retaining the basic topological interrelationship of forelimb                   skeletal elements even while certain aspects of the morphology of               the bony elements and the surrounding soft tissues have been                    greatly altered.  In particular, changes have occurred in the                   proportions and shape of the limb skeleton; the geometry and                    mobility of the forelimb joints; the attachment points, internal                architecture, and physiological capabilities of muscle tissue; and              the distribution of mass within the body.  We have yet to explore               how the wing skeleton functions during flight or the nature of the              bony material in wings.  This project will test the hypothesis that             skeletal composition and limb bone architecture in bats relate                  directly to the strenuous mechanical demands placed on the wing                 skeleton during flight.  We will explore the possibility that the               mineral content and basic properties of bat wing bones differ                   significantly from other mammals, and determine the stress flight               places on wing bones during flight.  This case study will be an                 important test of the general hypothesis that the structural design             of limbs in vertebrates is determined by the functional                         requirements of locomotion.",
