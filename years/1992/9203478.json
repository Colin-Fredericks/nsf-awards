 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacterivorous ciliates are an important component of planktonic                 food webs.  They can consume a large proportion of bacterial                    production, and convert material that is low in essential lipids                (bacterial biomass and detritus) into lipid-rich ciliate biomass.               How do consumers benefit nutritionally from these ciliates, and                 what role do they play in the biochemical transformation of ciliate             carbon?                                                                                                                                                         To investigate the nature of ciliate lipids and their fate and                  importance in the marine food web Dr. Harvey and McManus will:                                                                                                  -    identify and quantify ciliate lipids, especially ones that may                  be useful as group-specific biomarkers in trophic studies.                 -    examine sources of lipids in the ciliate diet and follow how                    ciliates assimilate and modify dietary lipids.                             -    measure the assimilation and transformation of ciliate lipids                   by one of their principal consumers, copepods.                                                                                                             This project combines biochemical measurements with feeding                     experiments.  Detailed lipid analysis of a number of ciliate                    species will first provide additional data on the ubiquity of the               unique compounds they have already observed.  They will measure in              detail the role of diet on lipid content and distribution of                    several representative bacterivorous ciliates.  Finally, they will              conduct in-depth feeding experiments to follow the incorporation                and transformation of ciliate lipids by grazing copepods.                                                                                                       These results will provide substantial new information on the role              of bacterivorous ciliates in the marine food web, especially their              importance in copepod nutrition.",
