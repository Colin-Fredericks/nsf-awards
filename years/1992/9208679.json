 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support the second annual West Coast Operator                   Algebra Seminar to be held at the University of Nevada on October               24-25, 1992.                                                                         The general area of mathematics of this project has its                    basis                                                                           in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently                being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
