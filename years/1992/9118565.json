 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues work on the effect of middle Miocene                tectonism on mammalian biogeographic patterns in the northern Rocky             Mountains.  The project will test hypotheses concerning the                     concordance between morphologic patterns, biogeographic patterns                and development of the Mid-Tertiary unconformity in Idaho, Montana,             and Wyoming.  The study will focus on interpreting the                          geochronologic and biogeographic patterns of the geomyoid rodents               (gophers, kangaroo rats, and such) from Barstovian deposits in 5                intermontane basins.  Geomyoid rodents are the focus because they               underwent a pronounced radiation just after the unconformity                    developed.  Computerized imaging and Geographic Information                     System techniques, combined with a cladistic approach, will be used             to analyze the biogeographic meaning of the abundant geomyoid                   dental remains from well-dated horizons in each of the basins, as               well as appropriate comparative material from other localities in               the Great Plains and Great Basin.  The research is of widespread                interest in (1) identifying the interplay between geologic and                  biotic processes on a timescale that has received little attention              (2-3 million years); (2) applying new paleontological techniques                (imaging and GIS) that allow us to address problems of interest to              both paleontologists (evolution, speciation) and geologists                     (chronology of basin formation) and (3) refining links of the                   magnetostratigraphic, vertebrate biochronologic, and radiometric                time scales in the middle Miocene, which is critical for                        understanding the tectonic evolution of the northern Rockies.",
