 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 5-year, district-wide leadership project is a cooperative                  effort of Eastern Washington University (EWU) and the Spokane                   School District No. 81 (SD 81), and involves an extensive                       program of science education for elementary school teachers to                  support the district's plan to dramatically restructure the                     elementary school science curriculum.  Each of the 36 district                  schools and approximately 10 participating private elementary                   schools will form a school-wide implementation team including                   the principal, two lead teachers, and members of the school's                   instructional team.  The 92 lead teachers will participate in                   a 4-week summer institute, follow-up meetings during the                        academic year, and an additional 2-week institute during a                      subsequent summer.  In addition to serving as resource                          teachers and members of their school's implementation team,                     lead teachers will assist project staff in developing and                       presenting short courses and workshops to support                               implementation of the science curriculum.  A number of                          different levels and types of short courses will be provided                    for the approximately 760 classroom teachers, to suit                           different levels of teacher interest and commitment.                                                                                                            This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because of its systemic plan to enhance in a                            substantive way the science teaching of all K-6 teachers in                     the Spokane school system.                                                                                                                                      The cost-sharing amount is approximately 76% of the amount                      requested from NSF.",
