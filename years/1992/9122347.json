 "awd_abstract_narration": "Corporations generally must enter the capital markets for                       financing to fund their investment projects.  The issuance of                   shares to shareholders and the issuance of debt to bondholders                  are the two primary sources of financial capital available to                   corporations.  Because their claims differ, the interests of                    bondholders and shareholders frequently diverge.  For example,                  relative to bondholders, shareholders generally prefer higher                   dividends, riskier projects, and financing new investment                       projects with additional debt.  Bond contracts contain bond                     covenants that attempt to mitigate these potential conflicts.                   The contribution of this project comes from assembling a unique                 database on the contractual relations between shareholders and                  bondholders.  The data are used to look directly at one of the                  most basic corporate relationships, that between shareholders and               bondholders.                                                                                                                                                    Registration statements for bond issues are used to compile a                   database detailing the use of restrictive covenants in bond                     issues.  The registration statements are for 327 nonconvertible                 bond issues registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission                by 217 utilities and industrial firms during 1989 and an                        additional 198 registration statements for the same firms in                    1986.  The data will be placed in public archives and made                      available to other researchers in this area.  This will be a                    significant contribution because previous work has had to rely on               financial data sources that provide incomplete summaries of                     actual bond covenants.",
