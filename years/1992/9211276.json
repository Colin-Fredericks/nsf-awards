 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research, jointly funded by the Divisions of              Materials Research and Mathematical Sciences, is to develop                     reliable theoretical methods for calculating the patterns that                  result in crystal growth subsequent to morphological instability                and to discover and quantify their unifying aspects.  Morphological             instability pertains to spontaneous changes in shape of some                    material body under the influence of driving forces such as                     capillarity, diffusion, and heat flow.  Examples include cellular               morphologies in semiconductor crystals, dendritic solidification of             metallic alloys, and shape changes of phases in composite                       materials.  Research methods include numerical solution of free                 boundary problems and phase field equations via supercomputing and              computer simulation using random walk algorithms.                               %%%                                                                             The accurate modeling and physical understanding of patterns which              form during the growth of crystals is an extremely difficult                    problem.  However, the growth of solid bodies from the melt is                  common to most fields of materials science.  Thus, any progress                 made in this field can have broad ramifications.  The work is also              highly interdisciplinary and requires research at the boundaries of             materials science, condensed matter physics and applied                         mathematics.  Consequently, this research in nonlinear science is               jointly funded through the Materials Research and Mathematical                  Sciences Divisions.",
