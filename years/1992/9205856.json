 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dominant mutations in two C. elegans genes, mec-4 and deg-1, induce             the deaths of specific groups of neurons. Dying neurons are                     characterized by cell swelling and morphologically resemble a                   commonly observed pattern of death termed necrosis.  Because in C.              elegans cell death mechanisms can be dissected using genetic                    approaches characterization of this necrotic like death should                  provide novel insight into this death process.  Mec-4 and deg-1 are             members of a gene family that appear to encode membrane proteins.               These genes (called degenerin genes) mutate in the same way to                  induce death.  mec-4 and deg-1 DNA sequences appear to cross                    hybridize to DNAs from a number of species, raising  the                        possibility that members of gene degenerin families in other                    organisms might also be capable of mutation to forms that induce                death.  The term long objective of the research is to determine how             mec-4 (d) induced cell death occurs at the molecular level and to               investigate whether similar death mechanisms are utilized in other              cell types and in other organisms.  Specifically, the work outlined             in this proposal will 1) accomplish a structure/function analysis               to define domains and amino acids required for mec-4 function, 2)               identify suppressor mutations that block mec-4(d)-induced death to              identify proteins that participate in the death process, and 3)                 isolate degenerin family members from different species.                        %%%                                                                             Elucidation of mechanisms of cell death are important for                       understanding development, homeostasis and pathology.",
