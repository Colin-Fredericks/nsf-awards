 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaboration between Joseph Birman, City College, and Su                  Zhaobin, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of                   Sciences, focuses on developing a better theoretical                            understanding of the non-equilibrium transport theory of                        microdevices.  This builds on earlier collaboration between                     Birman and Su.                                                                                                                                                  New classes of semiconductor materials, and new types of                        heterjunction devices, with novel electronic properties have been               produced in recent years.  This has been made possible by                       development of sophisticated techniques such as molecular beam                  epitaxy and metallorganic chemical vapor deposition which allow                 new types of engineering, and fabrication of special structures.                Resonant tunneling transistors are emerging as some of the most                 promising electron functional devices, allowing implementation of               a large class of circuits with greatly reduced complexity.                      Investigation of the properties of these transistors will improve               understanding of their potential in development of new devices,                 and even in development of new computer architectures.",
