 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the increased complexity of distributed and concurrent                programs, it becomes necessary to use formal methods to reason about            such systems.  This entails new research on using temporal logics and           state transition systems to reason about concurrent programs.  The              problem of proving properties of systems of processes communicating             through message channels that may lose or duplicate messages is                 investigated.  New methods for automatically verifying properties of            such systems specified in different temporal logics are proposed.                    Part of the research will be directed towards developing                   algorithms for verifying real-time properties of finite state                   concurrent programs specified in a branching time temporal logic.               New formalisms for specifying real-time behavior of finite-state                processes will be investigated.  In addition, new methods for proving           correctness of concurrent programs with respect to specifications               given by, possibly finite state, nondeterministic automata will be              explored.  Research on fault-tolerance in distributed systems will              focus on developing new algorithms for achieving fault-tolerance                through roll back recovery in distributed systems.  Specifically,               efficient algorithms that tolerate arbitrarily spaced crash failures            as well as application specific recovery procedures will be                     investigated.",
