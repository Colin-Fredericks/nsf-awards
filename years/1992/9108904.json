 "awd_abstract_narration": "The clause-linking theorem proving method was recently developed and            tested on a wide variety of problems, including problems in set theory          and temporal logic, and logic puzzles.  This prover converts a first-           order problem to the propositional calculus and then applies a                  propositional decision procedure similar to the Davis and Putnam                method.  This project will extend this theorem proving method to                problems involving equality and term rewriting.  This involves a                combination of representations like Brand's modification method, with           traditional term-rewriting techniques.  A procedure to solve                    inequalities involving the lexicographic path ordering will be used to          approximate specialized unification algorithms.  This work will also            incorporate meaningful semantics to guide the search; the semantics             will be presented as a collection of procedures for computing the               meanings of function and predicate symbols in a structure, as well as           a procedure for deciding the satisfaction of existential sentences in           the structure.  Methods for generating plausible lemmas and using them          to guide the search for a proof, will be developed.  The prover will            be applied to non-trivial mathematical theorems.",
