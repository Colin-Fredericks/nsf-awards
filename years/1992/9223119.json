 "awd_abstract_narration": "An innovative method to control and enhance turbulent heat                      transfer through the use of Lorentz force is proposed.                          Properly directed, the force control turbulence production in                   the boundary layers. This approach is called magnetic                           turbulence control (MTC). The feasibility of the method has                     been demonstrated in experiments on flat plate turbulent                        boundary layers with Reynolds number (based on momentum                         thickness) 1700. Measured turbulent stress was reduced by 90%.                  Laser-sheet flow visualization confirms the substantial                         reductions in turbulent motion at y+ = < 15. One of the                         attractive features of this approach is that through the                        proper selection of E and B fields and the introduction of the                  conducting fluid, very small power consumption is needed. In                    the proposed research, MTC will be extended to thermal                          boundary layers in water. Correlations between electromagnetic                  field strengths, heat transfer and shear stress will be                         determined. A further area of investigation may be the effect                   of MTC at increased Reynolds numbers.",
