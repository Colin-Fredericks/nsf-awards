The university participant                    will also visit other classes and work with teachers in the                     school setting; the school participant will also work with                      faculty and take one university mathematics course at the                       university.  The project also includes a series of summer                       seminars with the exchange participants, which will be                          offered for twenty educators from schools in the surrounding                    area. In these three week seminars the participants will                        experience the use of innovative teaching materials and                         methods as they explore topics in mathematics and will                          discuss many of the major issues facing mathematics education                   today.  Follow-up activities for all participants will                          continue during each academic year.",
