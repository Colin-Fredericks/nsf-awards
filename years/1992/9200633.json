 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors Juan Carlos Campuzano of                         the University of Illinois at Chicago and Arun Bansil                           of Northeastern University, to collaborate in materials                         research with Professors M. Lindroos and M. Pessa of                            the Physics Department of Tampere University of                                 Technology, Finland.  They will carry out a joint                               theoretical and experimental program to investigate the                         electronic structure of the high-Tc superconductors via                         angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.  Their                               research builds on the basis of highly productive past                          collaboration that has demonstrated the synergistic                             effect of their complementary theoretical and                                   experimental expertise.                                                                                                                                         With the increasing interest in angle-resolved                                  photoemission studies of superconducting compounds,                             there is a need to obtain corresponding theoretical                             intensities.  The proposed research will compare                                experimental spectra to first-principles predictions of                         the photoemission intensities in order to obtain                                significant new information and further understanding                           of the electronic structure of the new superconductors.                         Results should also help to establish the extent to                             which the conventional band theory picture can be used                          to describe the normal state electronic structure of                            the new materials.",
