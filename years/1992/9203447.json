 "awd_abstract_narration": "The leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) is a recently                   discovered transcriptional regulator from Escherichia coli that                 mediates extensive changes in gene expression, and acts both                    positively and negatively.  The first genes assigned to the Lrp                 regulon were identified by their Lrp-dependent response to leucine.             We have used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to identify over               30 polypeptides whose expression is regulated by Lrp.  Expression               of the majority of genes in the regulon is, in fact, not affected               by leucine.  These experiments are designed to systematically                   identify genes and proteins in the regulon, and to characterize the             mechanisms of action of Lrp on these target genes.  We are                      particularly interested in studying the regulation of leucine-                  independent genes, and in determining what physiological factors                govern their interaction with Lrp. We have identified glutamate                 synthase (GltBD), and outer memebrane porins OmpC and OmpF as                   proteins that are regulated by Lrp in a leucine-independent manner.             Our initial studies are designed to distinguish between direct and              indirect effects of Lrp on the expression of these genes, and                   between transcriptional and translational regulation.   We will                 determine N-terminal sequences of polypeptides whose expression is              regulated by Lrp, and design oligonucleotides for cloning the                   relevant genes.  We will also use blotting and two-dimensional band             shift assays to identify DNA sequences that bind Lrp, and to clone              the corresponding genes.                                                        %%%                                                                             These studies should provide clearer understanding of the                       physiological role of Lrp, the means by which it controls its                   target genes, and the integration of metabolism by global                       regulators.",
