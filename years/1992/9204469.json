 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal theme of this research is the application of                      group-theoretic techniques to a wide variety of search                          problems.  The ultimate objective is to combine algebraic                       techniques with standard search methods to solve \"hard                          problems\" which are currently solvable by neither method                        alone.  This requires the interaction of three major research                   efforts: the study of efficient algorithms for performing                       fundamental group computations; the development of an                           experimental system for testing algorithmic ideas on both                       sequential and parallel machines; and the exploration of                        methods for representing search problems in an algebraic                        setting and tools for solving them.  The algorithms to be                       studied play a fundamental role in the development of general                   algorithms for computing with groups as well as for                             application of group theory to real world problems.                             Applications are diverse and range from isomorphism testing of                  combinatorial objects to the transportation problems in                         operations research.  Both algorithms and applications will be                  implemented in both a traditional sequential environment                        engineered to support experimentation with a variety of data                    structures and techniques, and, where suitable, on a massively                  parallel SIMD machine.",
