 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Francis Williamson is the Director of the Institute of                 Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, which                    operates the Toolik Lake Field Station on Alaska's North Slope.                 The Station is one of 17 NSF-supported Long-Term Ecological                     Research Sites, and it supports research projects conducted by                  University of Alaska faculty members and a wide array of visiting               investigators.  Dr. Williamson plans a number of improvements to                the Toolik Lake Field Station, including installation of fume                   hoods that will allow bio- and geochemical procedures,                          construction of a modular laboratory, an upgrade in the                         electrical systems used for computers and communication, and                    acquisition of equipment for environmental monitoring.                               The research projects conducted at the Toolik Lake Field                   Station are rapidly increasing our understanding of the                         terrestrial and freshwater environments of the arctic tundra.                   The proposed improvements would correct current violations of                   safety regulations, and would increase the efficiency and                       productivity of the research projects based at the Station.                     Continued growth of research at the Station will require new                    instrumentation and improved lab facilities.",
