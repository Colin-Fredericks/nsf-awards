 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project offers a new hands-on laboratory course in                         Advanced Ceramics Processing, to complement the lecture course                  that is now required.  The laboratory offers a distinctly                       hands-on course as an elective to be taken by over 40 students                  each year.  To accomplish this, three high-quality, durable,                    user-friendly items of equipment are being acquired.  A zeta                    potential analyzer quantitatively characterizes the                             interactions between particles.  A spray dryer provides                         experiments in various powder preparation methods and for the                   preparation of special powders.  An injection molding apparatus                 enables students to explore the variables and fabricate small                   items using the injection molding process.  These experiments                   are combined with others that can be performed with presently                   available equipment.  This project has two major pedagogical                    effects: (1) the students are able to extend classroom ideas to                 a hands-on laboratory experience; and (2) a stronger                            processing-properties relationship is established.These                         equipment items bring to a critical mass the amount of                          equipment needed to offer this important laboratory course in                   advanced ceramics processing.",
