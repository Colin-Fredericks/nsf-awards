 "awd_abstract_narration": "New nonlinear spectroscopic techniques (interferometric and multi-              color degenerate four wave mixing), together with femto and pico                second conventional nonlinear and electro-optic modulation                      measurements, with be used to define mechanisms of optical                      nonlinearity in newly synthesized metal free and metallated ladder              copolymers, metallated macrocyclic polymers, thienylpolyene                     copolymers, mixed valence molecules (in solution) and polymers, the             photosynthetic reaction center and related model compounds, and in              fullerenes.  Copolymer synthesis techniques are used to overcome                intrinsically poor solubility of ladder, macrocyclic, and                       thienylpolyene materials, to retard photochemical degradation of                mixed valence and thienylpolyene materials, to control                          intermolecular interactions and to permit measurement of materials              under comparable local field conditions.  Treatment of electronic               and nuclear dynamics as well as the details of the applied                      electromagnetic fields by density matrix methods permits                        characterization of multiple mechanisms of optical nonlinearity in              a single material.  Preliminary realization of large optical                    nonlinearities suggest that, with further optimization of material              properties device application of organic, inorganic and mixed                   valence polymers, may be practical.                                                                                                                             This research on nonlinear optical materials combines synthesis,                state-of-the-art characterization and measurements, and study of                the mechanisms of optical nonlinearity.  The grant is supported                 jointly by the Polymers and the Solid State Chemistry components of             the Solid State Chemistry and Polymers Program.",
