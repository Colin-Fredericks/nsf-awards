 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Batterman aims to provide an in-depth philosophical                   discussion of the status of semiclassical mechanics.  This is an                area of research that is located somewhere between classical and                quantum mechanics, and which can most profitably be viewed as a                 modern formulation of the old (pre-1925) quantum theory.  A large               part of the concern with this question comes from the fact that                 many researchers in semiclassical mechanics appear to take the                  results as explanatory, and even to provide genuine understanding               of various quantum phenomena in terms almost entirely classical.                The nature of this understanding is being investigated by                       considering in detail some examples of how apparent failures of the             old quantum theory have, subsequently, succumbed to semiclassical               treatment.  It is Professor Batterman's major contention that for               semiclassical mechanics to provide genuine explanations and                     understanding, it must be considered a theory in its own right.  It             is not simply an approximation to the quantum theory; that is, not              merely a procedure for computing approximations to quantal                      solutions.  It is the aim of this project to consider the                       implications of this claim.",
