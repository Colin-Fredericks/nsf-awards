 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strata deposited during the globally warm, equable, Cretaceous             period preserve the record of a unique natural experiment which                 will help us better understand the dynamical behavior of the                    integrated earth system.  The stratigraphic record of the Western               Interior Cretaceous Seaway (WIKS) provides an unparalleled                      opportunity for study because of the availability of substantial                data sets that are ripe for synthesis and analysis.  Using the WIKS             as a working \"laboratory\" we propose to:  (1) understand the global             climate system and its variability during a period of extreme                   warmth; (2) validate climate models for conditions substantially                different from the present day; (3) determine the oceanographic,                biological, and chemical responses of the WIKS across the C/T                   boundary to both global and regional forcing factors; and (4)                   better define the links between these seaway responses and the                  geologic record of the Western Interior Basin.                                       In this study a series of hierarchical atmospheric and ocean               model simulations constrained by the diverse WIKS dataset will be               performed for three times slices representing different stages of               a major second order sea level cycle (Greenhorn cyclothem).  For                each time slice we will:  (1) determine the global paleogeography,              paleotopography, sea level, and atmospheric pCO2 from the                       literature; (2) perform baseline numerical experiments of global                climate using the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM); (3) perform               a series of CCM sensitivity experiments to sealevel changes, low                versus high topography, variable orbital parameters, and variable               pCO2; (4) investigate the sensitivity of the WIKS to CCM variation              by using daily wind stresses and evaporation minus precipitation                from the CCM runs to drive a three-dimensional, turbulent flow,                 coastal ocean model; (5) investigate the influence these                        circulation changes might have on organic carbon production, and                carbon and oxygen isotopes by following chemical tracers in the                 circulation model and developing box models of nutrients, oxygen,               and salinity; and (6) test these predictions by assembling                      lithofacies maps, benthic biofacies/oxygen gradient maps, and maps              of inferred temperature, paleosalinity and organic carbon                       distribution.",
