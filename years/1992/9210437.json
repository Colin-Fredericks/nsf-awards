 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative study on criminal careers (with                    Nagin, SES92-11896).  The study will test two competing models of               criminal careers.  One model suggests that there are two classes                of offenders (frequents and occasional) and that each has a                     different probability that an offender desists criminal activity                after a certain number of convictions.  The second models assumes               that each individual in a population has a propensity for                       engaging in criminal behavior, and that the offending rate for an               individual remains constant over the life course.  The study will               employ mixture Poisson regression models and latent-threshold                   normal regression models to analyze data from three longitudinal                data sets on criminal activity.                                                      This study will increase our understanding of patterns of                  crime over individuals' lifetime and of the social and individual               characteristics associated with criminal careers.",
