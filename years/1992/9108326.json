 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Callis of Montana State                        University will study the lowest-lying electronic states of                     indoles using experimental and theoretical methods.  The                        experiments will range from gas-phase to condensed-phase                        spectroscopic studies, and the calculations will use a                          semi-empirical theory which incorporates solute-solvent                         interactions.  These studies of indoles are of interest because                 indoles constitute the chromophore of the amino acid                            tryptophan, and an analysis of their spectra can help elucidate                 the effect of the solvent and protein environment on the                        electronic state energies and dynamics of the chromophores.                     %%%                                                                             In recent years many studies have sought to understand the                      fundamental functions of the molecular species involved in the                  chemistry of living organisms.  The current work will attempt                   to understand how the photochemically active constituent of the                 amino acid tryptophan might contribute to the functioning of                    proteins and enzymes which contain it.  Such studies could have                 far-reaching effects.  For example, recent work suggests that                   tryptophans may play an important role in modulating and                        directing large scale motions in proteins such as the enzyme                    lysozyme.",
