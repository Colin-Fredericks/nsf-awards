 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will illustrate fundamental concepts in                            introductory chemistry through innovative lecture                               demonstrations that involve the use of low-cost and readily                     accessible laser light sources.  Incorporation of these                         innovations in the General Chemistry course will enhance                        students' awareness of the creative contemporary approaches                     available to pursue classical questions in chemistry.  The                      lecture demonstrations will augment teaching of such topics as                  thermodynamics, kinetics, acid-base equilibria, chemical                        bonding, and atomic spectroscopy.  These laser-based activities                 are designed to enrich the students' understanding of the                       course material and stimulate their interest in chemistry.                      Students will gain a more accurate reflection of the dynamic                    nature of chemistry and the responsiveness of the field to                      advances in technology as well as an illustration of the way in                 which chemistry is currently practiced.  Curricular materials                   developed from this project will be made available to the                       undergraduate community from other institutions and will be                     presented at national and local conferences in chemistry and                    education.",
