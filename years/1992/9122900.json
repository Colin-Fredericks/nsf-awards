 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of population biology is to determine the casual                  basis for species distribution and local abundance.  Rare species               represent an extreme situation, hence they are a useful system for              studying factors that influence abundance.  Increasing awareness of             conservation issues has generated additional motivation to study                cases of rarity and appropriate management practices for rare                   species, but there is currently no coherent theoretical genetic or              ecological framework to address these issues.  Eupatorium resinosum             (rare) and E. perfoliatum (common) will be used in this study                   examining ecological and genetic characteristics associated with                rarity.  Low genetic variation is expected in rare species due to               genetic drift.  Genetic variation within and among populations will             be evaluated by using starch gel electrophoresis.  Inbreeding                   depression and limited range of environmental tolerance are also                expected in rare species.  A field experiment will be used to                   evaluate the extent of inbreeding depression.  A greenhouse                     experiment will be used to measure the extent of phenotypic                     plasticity which in turn influences a species environmental                     tolerance.  Due to the comprehensive design of this study, the                  information obtained will provide insights into both evolutionary               and management aspects of rarity.",
