 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to conduct research                                              on the design of robust output                                                  feedback control of a class of                                                  nonlinear systems.  The class of                                                systems to be considered is the                                                 class of input-output linearizable                                              systems, which arise in many                                                    applications such as robotic                                                    manipulators, aircraft control, and                                             electric machines.  The design                                                  procedure starts with the design of                                             a robust state feedback control                                                 followed by the design of a robust                                              observer to recover robustness                                                  achieved with state feedback.  The                                              performance of such observers are                                               usually hindered by difficulties due                                            to measurement noise and excessively                                            large transient response.  A recent                                             result by the principal investigator                                            has shown that, for the special case                                            of fully linearizable systems, the                                              undesirable transient behavior can                                              be eliminated by designing the                                                  feedback control to be globally                                                 bounded.  This proposal aims at                                                 developing a comprehensive theory                                               for the design of globally bounded                                              output feedback controllers.                                                    Problems to be investigated include                                             tracking, disturbance rejection                                                 servomechanisms, robustness,                                                    comparison of various state                                                     estimation schemes, and study the                                               effect of measurement noise.",
