 "awd_abstract_narration": "A four and half day conference devoted to pool and external                     flow boiling is proposed from March 23 to 27, 1992 in Santa                     Barbara, California.  Boiling is one of the most efficient                      modes of heat transfer.  Its applications encompass diverse                     engineering fields such as mechanical, chemical, nuclear and                    aerospace.  Boiling is also a very complex process.  Though                     considerable effort has been devoted to its study in the last                   50 years, the understanding is so incomplete that predictions                   cannot be made without the use of empirical constants.  The                     proposed conference will bring together                                         researchers from industry, government labs and universities in                                                                                                  Europe, Asia and the U.S. to assess the level of current                        understanding and to establish directions of future endeavors.                                                                                                  The conference is being sponsored by the Engineering                            Foundation and only modest funding is requested from the                        National Science Foundation.  Other funding is being sought                     from industry and other sources.",
