 "awd_abstract_narration": "Joints play an important role in analysis and design of                    automotive structures.  The objective of this faculty internship                is to develop a physical, design oriented joint model that                      estimates the static performance of a joint in terms of physical                design parameters, such as dimensions, and pitch of spot welds.                 The key idea is to develop and use a simple finite element joint                model consisting of intersecting box-shaped beams that accounts for             all the important deformation mechanisms in a joint.  The theory                of thin-walled structures and regress on results obtained by finite             element analysis of joint models in order to derive a set of simple             equations relating the dimensions of a joint and other physical                 design parameters with the behavior of the joint will be used.                       The study will provide designers of automotive structures with             a useful tool for preliminary design of new car models.  This                   design tool will allow them to apply structural optimization to                 improve the design of a joint and also of the overall car                       structure.",
