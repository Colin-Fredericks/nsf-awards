 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to the Department of Biology at the                 State University of New York at Fredonia to continue a successful               Research Experiences for Undergraduates program.  The SITE will                 foster the intellectual growth and emotional development of 10                  undergraduate participants per year by involving them in a                      investigation of plant-insect interactions.  The research will                  focus on the role that amino acids play in attracting insects to                plant nectars and on the role of nectar-derived amino acids in                  nourishing the nectar feeders.  Participants in the project will                collect plant nectars, observe insect behavior, biochemically                   analyze the lipid and protein components of insects fed different               nectariferous diets, and test hypotheses that relate the nectar                 diet to nutritional status.                                                                                                                                     In each of the three years, this project will be divided into two               parts, summer and winter.  The eight summer weeks will offer one                week of introduction to theory and methods, three weeks of directed             research on group projects, and four weeks of independent,                      participant-originated projects.  During the fall semester,                     participants will analyze the results of their independent                      projects.  They will return to Fredonia in January, when they will              prepare oral presentations of their projects to be presented at the             Eastern College Science Conference the following April.  Student                researchers in this project will develop through:  1) an increased              understanding of ecology, behavior, evolution, biochemistry, and                physiology, 2) hands-on experience with specific field and                      laboratory research techniques, 3) practice in critical reading and             analytical thinking, and 4) acquisition of a variety of research                support skills.  All of these accomplishments will enhance the                  emotional maturity of participants, help define their career                    choices as scientists, and, in some cases, raise their aspirations.",
