 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will involve two interrelated projects, (1)                  calculating nestmate relatedness and (2) assessing the extent of                sperm precedence in a communal, ground-nesting bee, Perdita                     portalis.  These two goals can be achieved most effectively using               methods of DNA fingerprinting.  Estimating average relatedness                  among nestmates is of interest because female P. portalis nest                  communally, with from 3 to 29 adult females per nest.  Communal                 nesting, the sharing of a single nest by more than one                          reproductively active female, is an evolutionary stable form of                 social interaction which is widespread in bees, but which has                   received little attention by students of social evolution.  While               many relatedness estimates exist for eusocial species, few data                 exist for communal species.  All behavioral evidence suggests                   that nestmates in P. portalis are closely related, both because                 nests are re-used for generations and because flightless males                  mate with their female nestmates.  In order to understand the                   role of kin selection, and other factors, in shaping communal                   societies, it is essential to accurately assess within nest                     relatedness.  Part two of the project focuses on the selective                  factors underlying the origin of maintenance of dimorphic males                 in P. portalis.   Males in this species occur in two non-                       overlapping morphs: a large-headed, flightless morph and a small-               headed, flight capable morph.  Large-headed males mate with their               female nestmates immediately prior to oviposition and engage in                 male-male battles which often lead to death of one combatant.                   These observations suggest that the large-headed morph has arisen               as a result of sperm precedence that confers a last male mating                 advantage.  In order to test this hypotheses it will be necessary               to assess paternity of eggs produced in observation nests.  The                 two projects are related in that the female social behavior                     establishes selective pressures on male mating behavior, and                    intra-nest mating should lead to elevated levels to nestmate                    relatedness.",
