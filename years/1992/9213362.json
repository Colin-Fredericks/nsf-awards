 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hierarchical relations between men and women are maintained,                    resisted, and transformed in large part through legal processes.                Legal consciousness plays a critically important role in the                    dynamics of gender domination and its resistance by women.  This                project aims to increase understanding of how legal consciousness               is shaped in historically and culturally specific contexts and to               assess its complex role in the transformation of gender relations               in the late twentieth century.                                                                                                                                  The project uses ethnographic methods combined with techniques of               discourse analysis developed in the law and language literature to              examine the impact of globally significant ideologies on legal                  consciousness and gender relations in two East African communities.             The project is centrally concerned with examining how two                       ideologies, feminism and Islamic fundamentalism, shape the legal                consciousness of Swahili Muslims in coastal Kenya and Tanzania.                 The project explores (l) how globally significant ideologies are                instantiated at state and local levels, through institutions                    associated with law, Islam, and women, and events such as                       conferences, speeches, and media portrayals; (2) how legal                      consciousness is shaped through encounters with global ideologies               mediated through Islamic and secular courts as well as through                  community organizations; and (3) how gender relations in Swahili                society reflect shifts in legal consciousness and the struggle over             ideology more generally in the post-colonial period.  Of particular             concern is the hypothesized contrast between the two communities                with respect to the impact of these ideologies and the                          transformation of gender relations.  This contrast should be useful             in developing a theoretical model--attentive to local and global                phenomena--of the complex interaction among globally significant                ideologies, legal consciousness, and gender relations.",
