 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal provides for the enhancement of minority                          student achievement in the science classroom.  It is a                          continuation of the summer and academic year portion of the                     Institute for Multicultural Science Education for two years,                    rotating a cycle of 30 new teachers and 30 returning                            teachers each summer.  Science teachers from the Madison and                    Milwaukee school districts will meet in Madison with                            Institute staff and faculty for four weeks during the summer                    to develop instruction in three areas that are predicted to                     enhance the science classroom environment for minority                          students.  The Institute is designed to foster changes in                       teachers' attitudes (toward minorities, role of teachers,                       organization of classroom), and empower the teachers to                         develop the skills necessary to put those attitudes into                        practice.  The three areas in which teachers will work are:                     (1) developing greater understanding of the strengths and                       needs of minority students; and investigating the                               applicability of (2) the cooperative learning approach and                      (3) the problem solving approach to enrichment of                               multicultural science classrooms.  Throughout the Institute,                    teachers will themselves learn in the cooperative                               learning/problem solving mode, with continuing attention to                     the needs of minority students.  The major task will be to                      develop new instructional units for teaching their science                      classes the following year utilizing those modes.                                                                                                               Cost sharing is equivalent to 52% of the NSF award.",
