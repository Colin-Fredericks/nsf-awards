Little is known, however, about                  how people are actually perceived in the real world.  When are                  stereotypes applied to make inferences about others versus when                 are other types of knowledge used to make inferences about                      others?  Further, given that each individual can be perceived in                multiple ways (by sex, race, occupation, etc.), which stereotypes               are most likely applied to different kinds of people?  This                     research is an investigation of some of the parameters of                       stereotyping, focusing on understanding when stereotyping occurs                and what kinds of stereotypes are most likely applied.  The                     research goes beyond prior work in multiple ways.  First, unlike                much of the recent work in stereotyping, this research does not                 assume that individuals are automatically racist or sexist.                     Rather, it investigates how people are actually perceived,                      testing how other types of knowledge (other known individuals)                  can be used to make inferences about new individuals.  Further,                 the University of Texas at El Paso offers the unique opportunity                to study inter-ethnic tensions in a place where the usual white                 majority is the local minority.  Given the changing demographics,               with Hispanics fast becoming the majority group in the southwest,               understanding racial stereotyping between Hispanics and Anglos                  seems particularly important - before it becomes a national                     problem.  Thus, this research will test hypotheses derived from a               newly developed model of person perception with the goal of                     understanding intergroup relations between Hispanics and Anglos.",
