 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an analytical and experimental effort to                   develop the design theory for high performance hydrostatic                      bearings, using water as a fluid medium.  Water offers some                     important design characteristics, such as very low temperature                  rise, for high precision machine tool applications.  It also                    overcomes the environmental issues that are traditionally related               to oil bearings.  Some of the significant issues that need to be                addressed are waters tendency to turbulent flow, because of its low             viscosity and its ability to corrode.  Preliminary work has shown               that some of these can be overcome using certain types of ceramics              and manufacturing the bearing components to very tight tolerances.              These issues will be further investigated and formalized in the                 development of the design methodology.                                               A keen interest in this project has been exhibited by                      industry, which should assist in the transfer of these results into             practice.  This research is of significant interest to the nation's             equipment industry.",
