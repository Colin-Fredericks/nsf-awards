 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                         metallic program is to support the investigation of poly-                       nuclear transition metal oxoalkoxide complexes.  The general                    focus is on compounds that may serve as soluble models for                      oxide surfaces, intermediates in alkoxide hydrolysis, and as                    precursors for sol-gel synthesis of new materials.  The metals                  of interest are molybdenum and vanadium with possible                           extensions to tantalum and niobium; alkoxides will be chosen                    from among several polyfunctional hydroxylic compounds.  The                    broad objectives of the research are to gain insight into the                   fundamental aspects of aggregation and thereby the control of                   nuclearity of the polynuclear species.                                          %%%                                                                             Metal oxides are among the most common and most useful metallic                 compounds but are also among the most difficult to characterize                 with respect to their mechanisms of formation and action in                     many catalytic reactions.  Many metal oxides are prepared by                    reaction of metal alkoxides (metal salts of alcohols) with                      water.  This research is designed to improve our understanding                  of both processes through the study of cluster molecules and                    ions that contain multiple metal atoms, and both oxide and                      alkoxide ligands.  The new compounds will be studied in                         solution and in the solid state by a variety of spectroscopic                   methods and solid state structures will be determined by x-ray                  crystallography.  Some of the compounds whose syntheses are                     proposed may be useful for the preparation of new ceramic                       materials and catalysts.",
