 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transcriptional regulation is one of the major control points for               gene expression in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and controls                during elongation and termination operate by a variety of                       strategies.  For several years, the elongation and termination                  properties of mammalian RNA polymerase II have been studies in this             laboratory.  This research includes studies on these reactions with             yeast RNA polymerase II using in vivo and in vitro techniques.  The             advantage to studying these processes in yeast (Saccharomyces                   cerevisiae) is the availability of powerful genetic tools to                    complement biochemical analyses. There are five specific                        objectives:  1) Identify the signals which cause yeast RNA                      polymerase II to terminate;  2) Define the physical structure of                specific elongation complexes;  3) Evaluate the contribution of the             conserved C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of the                       polymerase to the elongation reaction;  4) Examine the mechanism by             which yeast transcript elongation factor SII promotes terminator                read through by RNA polymerase II;  and 5) Identify other cellular              proteins involved in regulating transcript elongation in the cell.              The results from these experiments should provide fundamental                   information about the regulation of transcript elongation in                    eukaryotes.  The similarities in components of the transcriptional              machinery between yeast and larger eukaryotes suggest that much of              the information obtained here will be directly related to                       mechanisms in other eukaryotes.  Any differences which we observe               obviously will also be important.  The advantage to this approach               is that genetic tools are available to complement the biochemical               and cell biology approaches available in mammalian cells.                       %%%                                                                             Transcriptional regulation is a major control point for gene                    expression.  This control can occur during initiation elongation or             termination. Controls during elongation and termination by                      mammalian RNA polymerase II have been studied in this laboratory                for several years.  While studies of the mechanisms controlling                 transcript elongation and termination mammalian cells have provided             much preliminary information, there are limits to the types of                  experiments that can be done in such systems.  Thus, we propose to              expand our previous work with mammalian cells by studies of                     transcription regulation in yeast.  The advangatage to studying                 these processes in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is the                      availability of powerful genetic tools to complement biochemical                analyses.  There are five specific objectives: (1) Identify the DNA             sequences are which yeast RNA polymerase II stops elongating an RNA             chain,  These experiments will use both the intact cell in vivo as              well components isolated from those cell in vitro. (2) Define the               physical structure of specific elongation complexes containing the              polymerase, the DNA template, and the RNA transcript.  Enzymatic                and chemical probes will be used to identify the molecular contacts             between the protein and nucleic acid components in these complexes.             (3) Evaluate the contribution of the C-terminal domain of the                   largest subunit of the polymerase to the elongation reaction.  This             subunit contains a unique structure consisting of multiple.                     Repeated heptapeptide sequences.  Quantitative analysis of the                  elongation properties of polymerase molecules containing and                    lacking this domain will be carried our (4) Examine the mechanism               by which a yeast transcript elongation factor (SI) stimulates                   elongation by RNA polymerase II.  The clone for the yeast SII                   protein will be mutagenized, and activity of the mutant proteins                will be compared.  (5) Identify other cellular proteins involved in             regulating transcript elongation in the cell.  genetic analyses                 will be used to identify candidate proteins which will be further               characterized in vivo.  Complementing in vivo and in vitro results              will provide strong evidence for the participation of particular                proteins in elongation control.",
