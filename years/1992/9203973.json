 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project continues mathematical research into                  problems relating solutions of partial differential equations                   with mappings defined on surfaces in spaces of several complex                  variables.  The general Cauchy-Riemann equations which test for                 analyticity are expressed as first-order differential                           expressions.  In studying these expressions one tries to decide                 whether functions defined on surfaces and boundaries of domains                 can be extended as holomorphic functions to regions adjacent to                 the surfaces.  A fundamental tool in these studies is the                       embedding of analytic discs into complex spaces of higher                       dimension with their boundaries going into real hypersurfaces or                more general submanifolds.  The vanishing or nonvanishing of the                differential of such disc mappings has far-reaching implications                in the study of mappings of hypersurfaces as well as to the                     extension problem already mentioned.  Ultimately the research                   seeks to reveal more about mappings between manifolds, in                       particular to determine new geometric and algebraic invariants                  preserved under biholomorphic transformations. A second line of                 investigation follows from the recent completion of a succession                of papers leading to the complete resolution of one of the                      fundamental extendibility questions raised by Lewy in the                       mid-50's: minimality of a generic manifold at a point is                        necessary and sufficient to guarantee that every Cauchy-Riemann                 function near the point extends holomorphically to a wedge.  A                  description of the wedge of extendibility is unknown even in                    simple cases.  Work will be done in finding a geometric                         description of the wedge of extendibility.                                           Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them.",
