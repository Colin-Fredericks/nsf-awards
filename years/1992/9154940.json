Each student will experience hands-on usage of a wide variety of                modern laboratory instruments and equipment while working on three              individual, relevant projects of decreasing structure.  The first               project involves recycling inorganic industrial wastes into useful              high-temperature superconductor materials.  The second project is               a study of techniques to separate and identify organic compounds                such as those which occur in natural fruit flavorings and perfumery             oils.  The group will choose a third mini-research project from                 three options offered including  (a) a project to test new mixed                ligand extraction agent systems for ability to separate and recover             various toxic or vital metals from water solutions such as                      wastewater effluents,  (b) using a recently synthesized organic                 color reagent to develop a spectrophotometric method for analysis               of trace amounts of heavy metals in environmental samples, or                   (c) performing a wide variety of analyses to assess the quality of              individual water or soil samples taken from the environment.  The               last four weeks of the project will find each student working about             four hours per day in the laboratory of a research professor in one             of the following science departments:  chemistry, biology, physics              or geology.",
