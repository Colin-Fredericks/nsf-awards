 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prediction is of fundamental importance in all the sciences,                    including economics.  Forecast accuracy is of obvious importance                to users of forecasts because forecasts are used to guide                       decisions.  Comparisons of forecast accuracy are also of                        importance to economists more generally, who are interested in                  discriminating among competing economic hypotheses.  This project               is unified by concern with the forecasting of economic time                     series.  It develops new tools for building forecasting models,                 constructing point and interval forecasts, evaluating forecast                  performance, and uncovering empirical macroeconomic regularities.               These tools are used in substantive macroeconomic applications.                 This research is part of the economics of global change                         initiative because it contributes to the knowledge base of                      methods needed to enhance the credibility of future efforts to                  predict the economic impacts of global environmental change or                  the effects of policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas                       emissions.                                                                                                                                                      This project on modeling and forecasting economic time series has               eight interrelated parts: 1) markov-switching models; 2) exactly-               unbiased estimators and associated predictors in autoregressive                 models; 3) low-frequency dynamics and long-memory models; 4)                    estimation of misspecified forecasting models; 5) comparing                     predictive accuracy; 6) assessing the predictability of economic                time series; 7) forecasting with cointegrated models; and 8)                    combining forecasts.",
