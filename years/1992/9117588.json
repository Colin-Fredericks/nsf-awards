 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves drilling a 600 m pilot hole preparatory              to core-drilling a 4.5 km hole in the vicinity of Hilo, Hawaii, and             characterizing the returned core samples and well site using an                 array of modern geochemical, petrological, and geophysical                      techniques.  The principal objectives of the holes is to obtain a               nearly continuous, ordered record of the output of an oceanic                   volcano over a long interval of its main shield-building phase of               activity.  Only small fractions of the output and history of any                individual Hawaiian volcano are accessible through surface                      exposures and it is unlikely that the interiors of these volcanoes              will ever be exposed except by deep drilling.                                                                                                                        The primary scientific questions to be addressed concern the               nature of hot spots, in particular, the composition and origin of               the \"plumes\" they may represent, and how the upwelling material                 interacts with the lithosphere and surrounding mantle material on               time scales of 105 to 106 years.  These problems are intimately                 related to the nature of magma isotopic compositions and ages of                the lavas encountered in the drill core, and to invert this                     geochemical time series in conjunction with dynamical models for                plume behavior and melt generation to develop a comprehensive model             for the dynamics of the hot spot phenomenon at Hawaii.                                                                                                               Other major scientific questions that can be addressed through             study of a unique sample suite of the sort expected from drilling               include:  How long is an individual Hawaiian volcano active?  What              is the nature of the submarine-subaerial transition and of the                  submarine section of a major oceanic volcano?  What are the                     mechanisms of growth and the rate of growth of a Hawaii volcano and             of subsidence due to the load on the lithosphere from the growing               volcano?  What are the magnetic properties of oceanic volcanic                  rocks as a function of depth and petrology and how do these relate              to magnetic surveys near seamounts?  What is the thermal structure              and state of preservation of igneous features in the interiors of               the flanks of Hawaiian volcanoes far from rift zones.",
