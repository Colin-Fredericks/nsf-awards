 "awd_abstract_narration": "Poor U.S. student performance on national and international                assessments has prompted the development of a national goal for                 \"U.S. students to be first in the world in mathematics and science              achievement by the year 2000.\"  Many believe we can meet this goal              only if the entire education system in every state is restructured              to promote higher levels of achievement for all students.                       Mathematics has taken a national leadership role in developing                  consensus on a clear vision of what curriculum, student assessment              and teacher preparation must look like from kindergarten through                college to be successful in improving mathematical literacy among               our youth.  The thoughtful work of the mathematics education                    community provides significant information on policy and practice               issues related to mathematics education.  Likewise, state-sponsored             restructuring initiatives (such as the Re: Learning effort) over                the past three to four years have provided successful strategies                for systemic change.  However, we have not yet been successful in               linking these two efforts - mathematics education reform and state              efforts in systemic change.                                                          While the mathematics education community was developing                   consensus on new directions for mathematics education, policy                   makers were developing consensus on the role of policy in                       supporting systemic change.  There is now agreement that success in             changing the education system will be determined by how well state              policies support and encourage exemplary classroom teaching and                 learning.  The mathematics reports provide this vision for teaching             and learning in mathematics.  The task, now, is to translate this               vision into supportive state policies which help schools and                    districts commit to the systemic changes needed for improved                    student learning.",
