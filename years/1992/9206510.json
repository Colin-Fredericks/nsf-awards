 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtually all animals undergo marked changes in body structure,                 function and behavior which enable them to adapt to, and survive,               the hardships of a seasonally changing natural environment.  The                goal of Dr. Karsch's research is to understand the means by which               the changing seasons regulate seasonal reproduction, a natural                  process of reversible fertility and infertility.  He has selected               domestic female sheep as the model system.  In this species, the                process of seasonal reproduction is generated spontaneously by a                self-sustained endogenous rhythm of neuroendocrine activity.                    Changes in day length provide time cues which permit appropriate                phasing of this endogenous rhythm with cyclic changes in the                    environment.  Dr. Karsch will determine whether a short day                     photoperiodic cue is effective when given during anestrus, and                  whether a long day photoperiodic cue is ineffective when given                  during the breeding season.  The specific photoperiodic messages                will be restored by infusion of melatonin into pinelectomized                   sheep.  Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland only                at night, and it enables the animal to tell how long the night is               and thus the duration of the day.  The outcome of this research                 should lead to new insights into a fundamental problem of enormous              biological significance and practical importance: the regulation                of fertility.  The results will also be more broadly applicable to              a wide variety of physiological, metabolic and behavioral rhythms               which form an integral part of the adaptive mechanisms in many                  animals.  An understanding of these processes should have profound              implications to the reproductive biology of endangered species that             are seasonal breeding.  Since the studies will be done in domestic              sheep, the findings will have a direct bearing on production in the             food and fiber industries.",
