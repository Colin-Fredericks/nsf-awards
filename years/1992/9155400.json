 "awd_abstract_narration": "SPICA II is a continuation of Project SPICA (Support Program for                Instructional Competency in Astronomy), a program that promotes the             use of hands-on, activity-based science learning at all grade                   levels.  The program, which is designed to increase the amount and              quality of physical science being taught, relies on the                         attractiveness of astronomy to provide the vehicle for achieving                its goals.  Each summer for three years thirty different teachers               will participate in three week institutes where they will become                familiar with and use hands-on educational materials and learn                  related teaching methods.  These teachers then become SPICA                     'agents', delivering workshops which emphasize hands-on activities              to other teachers in their home regions, districts, and states.                 Some of the teachers teach at the college-level and will develop                and deliver in-service courses through university continuing                    education programs.  In addition, a teacher's handbook of                       activities will be produced and made commercially available.  Funds             from sales of the handbook will be used to help finance the ongoing             SPICA network.",
