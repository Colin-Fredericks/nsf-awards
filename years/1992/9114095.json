 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines a new approach to developing software for                project management that is expected to offer a wide range of                    improvements to both the software development process and the                   characteristics of the resulting applications.  The overall                     objectives are to construct systems that offer greater flexibility,             higher intelligence, and significantly better integration.  The                 proposed approach does not replace either traditional project                   management application or advanced application such as expert                   systems; rather, it offers a more efficient and uniform methodology             for implementing these programs and a new integrated environment                in which these application can reside.  The basic approach of the               proposed research which relies heavily on the concepts of object-               oriented programming, is to create a set of standardized software               objects that represent the fundamental elements of the project                  management process.  For example, objects would be created to                   represent a building's physical components (e.g., beams and                     columns), the basic construction activities needed to produce these             physical components, and the resources required to perform the                  activities.  These basic \"building block\" objects could then be                 pieced together , according to general design and development                   guidelines, to form the core of various project management                      application programs.",
