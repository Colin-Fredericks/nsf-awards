 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objectives are to obtain and analyze observations of               solar oscillations and long-term solar variability taken at SCLERA              (The University of Arizona Santa Catalina Laboratory for                        Experimental Relativity by Astrometry) and at Yunnan Observatory                near Kunming, China.  The international collaboration has been                  organized in order to furnish observations of the Sun covering a                sizeable fraction of a day and, consequently, to significantly reduce           the otherwise serious effects of false diurnal signals present in the           data of a single site.  The observations will be obtained with the              SCLERA solar seismographs currently in operation at the                         University of Arizona and at Yunnan Observatory.  The set of                    facilities offers research and educational opportunities that are at            the forefront of solar physics for both U.S. and Chinese scientists             through a relatively low-cost ground-based program.  The first                  results from the international cooperation are expected to yield                improved information about the structure of the interior regions of             the Sun and about long-term solar variability, which may have an                impact on long-term variations in the Earth's climate.",
