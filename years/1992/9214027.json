 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Chemistry Program supports research by Dr. Joseph S. Merola of                  the Chemistry Department, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, on                    oxidation addition reactions of various organic substrates to                   iridium phosphine complexes.  The substrates involve E-H bonds,                 where E = H,B,C,N,O.  The reaction chemistry of the series of                   E-Ir-H compounds thus generated will be investigated,                           especially with respect to the insertion of unsaturated                         molecules into the E-Ir and H-Ir bonds.  Thus, fundamental                      processes occurring at the metal center in chemistry related to                 hydrogenation, catalytic hydroboration, C-H bond activation,                    hydroamination, and hydroalkoxlylation will be studied.                         Anionic groups on the iridium will be varied in order to                        promote the catalytic activity of these systems.  Some of the                   reactions will be carried out in aqueous solution.                              %%%                                                                             Oxidation addition reactions play an important role in both                     catalytic and stoichiometric reaction chemistry of                              organometallic compounds.  The long range goal of this project                  is to develop catalyst systems for the addition of E-H bonds to                 unsaturated organic compounds.  This could have important                       industrial implications but since the reaction chemistry of                     these potentially significant processes is not well known,                      fundamental advances are also anticipated.",
