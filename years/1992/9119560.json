 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hymenoclea salsola is a warm-desert shrub with a large                     geographic range in North American deserts.  When plants                        originating from diverse geographic locations were grown in a                   common garden, genetic differentiation was observed in plant                    characters influencing the rate and photosynthetic efficiency of                water consumption.  It is hypothesized that environmentally-                    imposed variation in water-loss rates alters the balance between                water acquisition and consumption, and accounts for the genetic                 differentiation of different geographic races.  To investigate                  the underlying mechanisms, separate measures of root, stem and                  whole plant hydraulic conductance (water transport capacity                     between soil and leaf) will be make using several techniques                    applying known pressure differentials over the respective                       pathways and determining consequent flux rates.  These data will                be integrated with measures of whole canopy gas-exchange (water-                loss and photosynthesis), and carbon isotope discrimination                     during photosynthesis.  The plasticity of individual genotypes to               short-term changes in growth conditions will be compared with                   genetic differentiation to contrasting conditions over                          evolutionary time.  The importance of hydraulic limitations will                be evaluated in terms of immediate feed-back control on stomatal                behavior, and also long-term adaptive differentiation across                    geographic races.  The results will enhance our understanding of                1) the integration of resource capture and consumption in plant                 water relations, 2) limitations imposed by plant morphology on                  physiological activity, 3) mechanistic relationships between                    plant water-use characteristics and climatic variation, and 4)                  the relationship of a unique arid-land plant habit, a canopy of                 photosynthetic stems, to general principles of plant water-                     relations.",
