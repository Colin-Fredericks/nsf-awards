 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major continuing question in paleoceanography is how the                      paleohistory of the atmospheric carbon dioxide content is related               to the contemporaneous productivity of the oceans.  In the Southern             Ocean where nitrates are one of the major phytoplankton nutrients,              it is possible to estimate the regional paleoproductivity by                    investigating the variability of nitrogen isotopes in sediment                  cores.                                                                                                                                                          It is known that when nitrates are abundant in the euphotic zone                (as in antarctic waters today), phytoplankton discriminate against              nitrogen-15, resulting in biomass and sinking particulates                      isotopically lighter than the dissolved nutrient pool.  When                    nitrate concentrations decrease as a result of biological                       utilization, the sinking particulates become isotopically heavier.              It is expected that the downcore variations in nitrogen-15 reflect              time variations in the predominance of these surface processes.                                                                                                 Other productivity or nutrient indicators, such as the                          Cadmium/Calcium ratio, carbon-13 in calcite, or opal accumulation               have presented conflicting interpretations of the paleodistribution             of both productivity and surface nutrients.  Sedimentary nitrogen-              15 is expected to specifically record past changes in biologically              mediated nutrient depletion.                                                                                                                                    This study will confirm the relationship between nitrogen-15 and                nitrates in surface waters using recently collected samples in the              Indian Ocean sector, and use sediment analyses to reconstruct                   surface nutrient utilization in several sectors of the Southern                 Ocean.  Existing cores with established stratigraphy will provide               sufficient coverage of the targeted regions.",
