 "awd_abstract_narration": "The high loss of life and property in fires each year in the U.S.               underscores the need for additional research on fires and fire                  safety.  Natural and synthetic organic polymers are most                        frequently the materials which are primarily responsible for the                propagation of fires.  The Phase I objective was to demonstrate                 the feasibility of applying the FG-DVC computer model, which                    includes the processes of depolymerization, crosslinking, and the               formation of char, tar, and gases, and the TG-FTIR technique,                   which integrates a thermogravimetic analyzer (TGA) with an FT-IR                for evolved gas analysis, to the measurement and modeling of the                degradation of polymers under conditions of interest in fires.                  Because of the importance of charring polymers as flame resistant               materials, the primary emphasis in Phase I was on phenol                        formaldehyde resin, which is a commercially important example of                a charring polymer.  The main conclusions from this effort can be               summarized as follows:  1) The FG-DVC model can be generalized to               predict kinetics, product evolution, tar yields, and tar                        molecular weight distributions for phenol formaldehyde and other                charring polymers over a wide range of conditions; 2) the TG-                   FTIR method can provide information on several aspects of polymer               combustion behavior:  kinetics, degration mechanisms, char                      formation, gas toxicity, gas and char heating value, tar                        formation, and flame retardance.  3) In order to further develop                the FG-DVC model as a submodel for a charring polymers in a fire                model, a need was identified for a new experiment to provide                    information on the thermal and radiative properties of a charring               surface.  This need can be met by a new version of the TG-FTIR                  experiment, to be developed in Phase II, which includes both FT-                IR emission and transmission spectroscopy.  The ultimate goal of                the combined Phase I and Phase II programs is the development of                a laboratory scale methodology for assessing the relative                       flammability as a function of polymer structure and fire                        conditions.  The product would consist of an integrated software                and hardware package which utilized the TG-FTIR analysis method                 and modifications of this method and the FG-DVC model as key                    components.",
