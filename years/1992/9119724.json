Although crane flies are typically                   most diverse and abundant in moist habitats, several subgroups                  show repeated, independent evolution and diversification into                   arid habitats, a phenomenon apparently unique to the American                   Southwest in this otherwise worldwide group of insects.                              Three main objectives are being pursued: (1) Define the                    species subgroups within the crane fly subgenus Lunatipula of                   genus Tipula in the northern hemisphere, from which nearly all of               the desert crane fly species groups have arisen; (2) Examine in                 detail three desert crane fly groups of Lunatipula, describing                  and illustrating all new and previously known species,                          determining the geographical distribution of each species and                   inferring each group's phylogenetic history; and (3) Use                        knowledge of the geographic ranges and evolutionary history of                  these three crane fly groups, as well as those previously                       published for other North American desert insects, to synthesize                a general hypothesis regarding development and diversification of               the North American desert insect fauna.  The studies will utilize               specimens already in museums as well as those secured on three                  collecting trips to the Southwest and northern Mexico.",
