 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subject of this proposal is the design automation and rapid                 prototyping of analog systems with initial emphasis on integrated               continuous-time filters, and uses the classical technique of                    signal-flow graph LC ladder simulation.  To exploit the increased               circuit density available in current technologies, it is important              to extend the range of analog design automation to larger                       subsystems.  By providing a methodology and software for the rapid-             prototyping of integrated continuous-time filters from a high-                  level, behavioral description, this research provides system                    designers with a tool to design new, tunable and/or programmable                integrated circuits for use in such areas as communications, mass               storage devices, and other continuous-time analog interfaces to                 real world signals.  Related and equally important areas of                     research addressed in this project for integration of continuous-               time filters are tuning, compensation for parasitics, and scaling               for dynamic range.                                                                                                                                              The research is divided into three phases.  Phase 1 concentrates                on the manual and prototype software design and on MOSIS                        fabrication of CMOS TGC filters.  In Phase 2, the experimental                  results in cross talk, signal feed-through, excess phase and tuning             are used to refine the prototype software into a complete                       continuous-time analog filter synthesis tool.  Phase 3 focuses on               additional improvements of the software, such as optimization                   issues in the filter synthesis, on the number of identical                      transconductance macro-cells and capacitors used to realize a                   signal-flow graph simulation of an LC filter, use of multi-input                transconductors, and other realization methods, such as element                 substitution and cascade of biquads.",
