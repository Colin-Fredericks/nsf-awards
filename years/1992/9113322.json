 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports upgrading equipment and data                           communications lines for MICHNET, a statewide network operating                 among higher education institutions in the state of Michigan.                        The MICHNET system has been operating since 1973 utilizing                 X.25 network protocols.  Current traffic volume, however, has                   exceeded the capacity of the hardware and software and modern data              communications equipment supporting TCP/IP is being installed.                  Also, the lines comprising the statewide backbone are being                     upgraded to 1.5 million bits per second from the current speed of               56,000 bits per second to accommodate the larger volume of traffic.                  A primary goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative               projects and sharing of resources between institutions, including               those outside the state.  MICHNET will provide operations                       management and information services and it will give the                        participating universities a connection to the NSFNET, a high speed             (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network.  The              project will also support an upgrade of central site redundant and              equipment.                                                                           The universities need greater functionality and network speed              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                   transfers  along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore                    innovative educational resources.",
