 "awd_abstract_narration": "The impacts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs emitted by                  vegetation on atmospheric chemistry are under increasing                        scrutiny, especially since they play a central role in                          photochemical smog formation.  Past investigations have focused                 on hydrocarbon components of VOC's, but recently large quantities               of oxygenated hydrocarbons (OHC's), such as methanol and acetone,               have been found in the air of rural forests, leading to questions               about their origins and roles in tropospheric chemistry.                        Preliminary measurements indicate that methanol can be emitted by               leaves at high rates, similar to that for isoprene emission, and                that conifer buds emit substantial quantities of acetone,                       suggesting that vegetation is a significant source of volatile                  OHC's.  The proposal addresses several key questions. 1) How much               methanol and acetone are emitted by various species of plants? 2)               What different plant parts (e.g., buds, leaves, bark, etc.) emit                methanol and acetone? 3) How do environment, phenology, season,                 and plant stress influence methanol and acetone emissions?  The                 effects of environment and stresses will be examined in                         controlled laboratory experiments.  Fluxes of OHC's from                        different plant families will be assessed as part of the Rural                  Oxidants in a Southern Environment (ROSE II) study in a                         southeastern forest (summer 1992), and from field surveys in the                boulder area.  Fluxes will be measured using bud, leaf, branch,                 and stem enclosures with OHC analysis by gas chromatography.                    This work will provide the first comprehensive overview of plant                methanol and acetone emissions, which will be useful in                         atmospheric modeling of tropospheric chemistry, particularly of                 rural areas, and will provide estimation of natural sources of                  atmospheric methanol before methanol-containing fuels come on                   line.",
