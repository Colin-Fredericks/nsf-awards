 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phylogenetic analysis is critical to an evolutionary                       understanding of any character distribution, including that of                  sexuality, and yet there has been no concerted effort to apply                  phylogenetic methods to studying the evolution of sex.                               This study will examine the phylogenies of two related groups              of South American weevils that consist primarily of parthenogenetic             species.  Morphological evidence indicates that each group includes             a speciose clade that is primitively parthenogenetic.  The study                will rely primarily on mitochondrial DNA sequences for phylogenetic             analysis.  Flow cytometry and allozyme data will be used to confirm             the distribution of parthenogenesis and to provide additional data              on relationships among clones.  The ages of parthenogenetic clades              and their origination and extinction rates will be estimated using              DNA sequence data.                                                                   This study will lay the groundwork for testing theories of sex             using parthenogenetic weevils; it aims to serve as a model for a                much-needed program of phylogenetic research into the evolutionary              biology of sex.",
