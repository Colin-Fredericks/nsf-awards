 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous optical systems for optical processing and optical                     memories and other widespread applications such as optical neural               networks, optical communications, pattern recognition, laser                    printing and scanning, and visual displays, have been designed,                 but require and presently lack high-performance, easily usable                  addressable arrays of light sources.  We propose to fulfill this                need by constructing arrays of individually electronically                      addressable vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser.  Their                      implementation into such systems will straightforwardly simplify                such systems and dramatically improve performance compare to                    alternative input light sources based on spatial light modulators               or fixed-mask inputs.  For optical processing systems such as                   those mentioned above, simplification occurs through elimination                of many unnecessary optical components.  Higher speed, more                     versatility and greater tolerance to varying device                             characteristics are the main forms of improved performance.                     Optical memories like compact disk or optical type would increase               their speeds many-fold by reading, for example, 64 bits at a time               rather than only one.  VCSEL's are fundamentally much better                    suited for these applications than the more mature edge-emitting                diode laser technology, mainly because they emit circular, low-                 divergence beams, and they can be fabricated in arbitrary one- or               two- dimensional patterns.  The utility for such general-purpose                arrays (e.g. linear 1x64) is likely to range far beyond what we                 can presently imagine.",
