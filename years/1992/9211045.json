 "awd_abstract_narration": "Controlling search is a central concern for AI.  Overcoming                     combinatorial search in realistic planning, design, and reasoning               problems requires large doses of domain specific search control                 knowledge.  Explanation Based Learning (EBL) has emerged as a                   standard technique for acquiring search control knowledge.                      Previous EBL work has produced impressive demonstrations but has                also uncovered a fundamental problem EBL frequently constructs                  overlycomplex explanations that yield ineffective control                       knowledge.  This research describes a solution:  integrating EBL                with partial evaluation to improve EBL's explanations.  In                      standard EBL systems, the problem solver's behavior on a training               example determines what EBL explains and how.  Partial                          evaluation, in contrast, performs a global analysis that often                  yields simpler and more general explanations.  In previous work,                STATIC (a partial evaluator written by the PI) was pitted against               PRODIGY/EBL, a state of the art EBL system.  When tested in                     PRODIGY/EBL's benchmark problem spaces, STATIC generated search                 control knowledge that was up to three times a effective as                     PRODIGY/EBL's, and did so twenty six to seventy seven times                     faster.  Since STATIC's analysis in not focused by training                     examples, however, it may flounder when confronted with large and               complex problem spaces.   The PI intends to design and build a                  hybrid system , called DYNAMIC, that will overcome the weaknesses               of both approaches.  DYNAMIC will identify learning opportunities               a la PRODIGY/EBL, BUT GENERATE EXPLANATIONS a la STATIC.  The                   detailed studies of the two systems suggest that DYNAMIC will                   significantly out perform both, and yield insights in two                       fundamental questions: how to improve machine generated                         explanations, and what is the appropriate role of training                      examples in explanation based learning?                                          //",
