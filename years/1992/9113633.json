 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inherent passivity property of mechanical systems has long                  been recognized and exploited for stabilization, and applications               of this property appear in several contexts including robot and                 spacecraft stabilization.  The underlying assumption is that                    every degree of freedom for such systems is directly actuated.                  However, when this assumption is violated, the passivity property               is less useful.  Earlier work has demonstrated that under a mild                stabilizability and detectability condition, the inherent                       passivity in a class of under-actuated systems remains very                     useful in the stabilization of such systems.  This project's                    intent is to further develop this approach.  Particular attention               will be paid to specific applications to common classes of                      flexible structures, including flexibly jointed robots, flexible                links, serially connected flexible bodies, and rigid bodies with                flexible appendages.  The theoretical results will be validated                 on an existing laboratory experimental facility.***   //",
