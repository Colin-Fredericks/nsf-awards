 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global Climate Change often abbreviated as Global                               Change is burdened with complexity and                                          uncertainty.  To overcome this obstacle, substantial                            and increasing human resources are dedicated to                                 the advancement of the understanding of Global                                  Change, and are expected to result in a                                         comparatively rapid increase in knowledge.  This,                               however, will take time.  While there is genuine and                            legitimate disagreement as to when to initiate the                              mitigative action and what kind of alternative                                  strategies (with no action being one of the                                     alternatives) have to be formulated and a basis for                             this comparative evaluation has to be established.                              In this respect, we propose a multivalued index                                 called the Energy Production Index (EPI) that                                   accounts for physical (climatic, biological, etc.) and                          economic factors.  EPI replaces the traditionally                               used Global Warming Potential (GWP) which is far                                to simplistic and inadequate leaving out many                                   critical factors such as transition dynamics and                                global warming dynamics.  Methodologies based on                                systems approaches will be used to develop tools to                             evaluate EPI and therefore the impact of energy                                 production policy on global change.  Suspected                                  global warming processes will be accounted for and                              their effect compared.  Computer-aided tools to be                              generated can potentially be used for policy                                    formulation, evaluation and negotiation processes.",
