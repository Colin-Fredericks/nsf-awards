 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on the acquisition of knowledge underlying             understanding of mathematics and science.  One set of studies will              develop further Gelman's commitment to achieving a good description             of the kinds of understandings that children have when they start               their school math and science lessons.   A second set of studies                will pursue the fact that these early understandings sometimes do               and sometimes do not facilitate further learning about mathematics              and science.  The research will be concerned especially with the                conditions under which early knowledge acts more like a barrier to,             as opposed to a support for, further learning.  To illustrate, many             elementary school children read fractions as if these kinds of                  symbols are novel ways of writing whole numbers; for example when               asked to read 1/2, they say  \"one and two\" or \"one plus two, that               is three\", or even \"12.\"  Similarly, they will say that 1/4 is more             than 1/2 because \"four is more than two\" or 2.09 is more than 29                because 209 is more than 29.  The research will investigate ways to             build understanding of why rational numbers are different from                  count numbers, that is that fractions are governed by different                 rules of mathematics than are the positive count numbers.  There                are several reasons to look forward to these efforts.  First,                   understanding of fractions is related to understanding of a range               of important ideas, including division, measurement, and the notion             of equal units, and so on, just the kind of concepts one would                  expect to be included in a definition of mathematical literacy.                 Second, it is well known that fractions are a watershed for                     students; those who do master them mathematically go on to learn                more mathematics, while those who do not have special trouble even              with algebra.  Additionally, these studies will offer insight into              the more general need to understand how conceptual change can take              place.                                                                                                                                                          This research's focus on the contrast between initial learnings                 that lead readily to further concept acquisition and those that                 take special efforts to surpass the boundaries of what is already               known will offer important insights on the kind of environments                 that are needed to encourage and support a learner's advance to                 scientific and mathematical literacy, a knowledge state that                    reflects the ability to understand and use the relevant concepts as             well as their related symbols and terms.  Already, Gelman's                     progress with these research questions has led to the development               by others of a curriculum that embeds science instruction into a                High School English as a Second Language program.  As a result,                 students are acquiring understanding of scientific terms they will              encounter when they start science classes.",
