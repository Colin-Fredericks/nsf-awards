 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daylength and other photoperiodic cues regulate                            reproduction of many animals in shallow-water marine habitats.                  The depth to which such cues are important in the sea has not                   been investigated, but it is known that numerous deep-sea and                   bathyal invertebrates also reproduce seasonally.  Seasonal                      reproduction in these species correlates with numerous                          potential environmental signals, including seasonal flux of                     nutrients, but the actual cues that entrain seasonal                            reproductive cycles have not been investigated experimentally                   for any deep-sea invertebrate.  Using submersibles, Dr. Young                   will test two potential factors that could control reproduction                 in bathyal echinoids living on the slope in tropical seas:                      seasonal flux of macrophytic detritus, and daylength cycles at                  very low light intensities.  He will also investigate the                       relationship between food supply, growth, fecundity, and timing                 of reproduction using in situ experiments in which food is                      manipulated in enclosures on the sea floor.",
