 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large uncertainty exists concerning the quantitative ability of               the oceans to take up anthropogenic CO2.  A more complete                       understanding of the relationship between ocean and atmospheric                 chemistries would broaden the ability of science to predict the                 magnitude and rate of global warming so that appropriate                        countermeasures could be developed and implemented.                                                                                                             An analytical instrument is needed to make continuous measurements              of the CO2 concentration above and below the oceanic surfaces.  For             the large scale studies needed, the instrument will have to                     function unattended, allowing placement on surface buoys or ships,              and be able to transmit data to a central data collection station.              It will be developed to withstand the extreme environmental                     conditions routinely encountered at sea and utilize a new solid                 state sensor technology that has the potential performance and cost             features suitable for remote monitoring of the CO2 levels in both               shallow and deep ocean waters.  The proposed system will include                the data acquisition and telemetry electronics for automated                    monitoring at remote locations.",
