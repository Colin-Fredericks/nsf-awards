The                   goals are to increase retention of majors, prepare capable                      teachers and increase the scientific and technical literacy of                  citizens. Courses will be offered in a highly visual, user-                     friendly, computer-based learning environment CSLA's NeXT                       computer lab of 25 color workstations. Language barriers for                    the highly diverse , multi-ethnic population of CSLA are less                   of a problem in an interactive environment utilizing side-by-                   side pictures, animations, videos, sounds, graphs, words and                    numbers. Also, techniques, concepts and demonstrations which                    are too expensive, dangerous or which do not lend themselves to                 traditional modes of instruction are taught. Faculty from                       Biology, Chemistry, Geology and Physics will modify                             introductory courses including Science Orientation, Intro                       Biology, Intro Chemistry, Quantitative Analysis, Environmental                  Geology, General Physics, and Astronomy. These curricular                       changes will involve 100 math, science and engineering                          undergraduate majors, 100 education majors, and 150 general                     education students annually. This project also seeks to inspire                 and instruct other faculty about the intuitive, appealing and                   quickly mastered electronic desktop techniques. Evaluation will                 be by external review and through comparison of student                         performance using traditional versus electronic desktop                         techniques. Results will be disseminated through publication,                   professional presentations, and regional workshops.",
