 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                               Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. David N. Hendrickson of                   the University of California, San Diego will undertake an                       investigation of electronically labile transition metal                         complexes.  These include systems that exhibit spin crossover                   (between two spin states centered on the metal), valence                        tautomerism (transfer between the metal and a coordinated                       ligand), and intervalence transfer in binuclear complexes                       (transfer between two metal centers that have different                         oxidation states).  These studies will employ a broad range of                  Techniques for physical inorganic studies as well as molecular                  mechanics calculations of substituent and lattice solvent                       motions to aid in the determination of the factors affecting                    the rate of electron hopping and the lifetimes of excited                       states.  Such electronically labile systems could provide the                   basis for optical switches, information storage devices, and                    other electronic components.                                                    %%%                                                                             Electron movement between orbitals (states) in a variety of                     solid state, transition metal compounds will be investigated.                   The goal of these studies is to understand the structural                       factors that govern the rates of electron movement between                      states and the lifetimes of higher energy (excited) states.                     Such an understanding is critical to technological applications                 of such transition metal compounds for optical switches,                        information storage devices, and other electronic components.",
