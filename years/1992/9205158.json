 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on the analysis of transport                       properties and constitutive relations of composite materials and                their application to problems of optimal structural design.                     Improved bounds and self consistent estimates will be developed                 for composite systems.  The types of composites considered are                  two phase elastic composites with symmetry, partially debonded                  two phase elastic composites, two phase thermal conducting media                with surface resistance between phases, and random emulsions of                 two Stokes fluids incorporating surface tension effects.  New                   mathematical techniques involving new applications of null                      lagrangians, weakly lower semicontinuous functionals, and dual                  variational principles will be employed.  These anticipated                     results as well as the existing theory will be applied to the                   numerical solution of optimal structural design problems.  The                  optimal design problem considered here is the previously                        untreated problem of maximum strength design of composite systems               subject to an ensemble of random static loads.                                       Many modern optimal structural designs incorporate the use                 of composite materials.  The goal of the proposed research is to                utilize the most recent advances in the characterization of                     composite systems to facilitate solution of problems of optimal                 structural design.  Anticipated applications include design of                  offshore oil platforms, large structures subjected to wind loads,               and large space structures.",
