 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has three important goals:  to propose and                    investigate new effective algorithms for conservative generation of             garbage collection in C and C++ (using true generation techniques), to          use a new simulation-based evaluation technique that is largely                 language and system independent, and to prototype the most attractive           algorithms and measure them directly.                                                In recent years, conservative collection algorithms have been              used in C and C++.  This project focuses on developing, evaluating and          implementing the most efficient generation techniques available in the          context of conservative collection.  All existing conservative                  algorithms for C and C++ require that every living object in the heap           is scanned during each garbage collection-eliminating two essential             advantages of generation collection (locality and efficiency).  The             new algorithms investigated will only require that a small subset of            the heap is scanned during each collection.  By investigating the use           of garbage collection in such widely-used languages as C and C++, and           by providing a thorough comparative evaluation of these techniques,             this research may lead to widely-used versions of efficient garbage             collection implementations.                                                          In the past, evaluation of garbage collection algorithms has been          limited by the high cost of implementing the algorithms.  As a result,          substantially different algorithms have rarely been compared in a               systematic way.  Recently, however, Zorn showed that trace-driven               simulation using object-level traces can be successfully used to                evaluate and compare different garbage collection algorithms.  This             project extends previous work by combining object-level tracing with            abstract execution, thus allowing evaluation of garbage collection              algorithms in a mostly language-independent manner.",
