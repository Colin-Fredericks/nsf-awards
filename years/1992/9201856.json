 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental and theoretical investigations of the                              morphological and chemical roughness of interfaces in                           multilayer structures, and the evolution of such roughness                      with growth and processing conditions, will be conducted.                       The evolution of roughness and the effect of interruption                       by the introduction of a new layer will be investigated, as                     will be the influence of strain on growth front roughness.                       X-ray diffraction measurements of buried interfaces will                       be compared to STM measurements of growth front correlation                     functions.  Statistical mechanical methods will be used to                      develop models for growth of multilayer structures in which                     kinetic processes change periodically.  Luminescence and                        electrical measurements will be correlated where possible.                      Studies will initially focus on Si/SiGe and III-V compound                      superlattices.                                                                  %%%                                                                             Interfaces between chemically or structurally                                   distinguishable layers are critically important in the                          performance of a host of devices, including photonic,                           electronic, or optical, whose unique properties depend on                       the multiple layering of thin films.  In such structures,                       interfaces play a decisive role in performance.  This                           research will enhance our understanding of the influence of                     interface quality on device performance by providing                            quantitative measures of interface morphology and                               correlation to electrical and optical properties.  In                           particular, the connection with growth and processing                           condition will be explored, with the prospect of improved                       technology for the fabrication of multilayer-film devices.",
