 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports mathematical research into problems                    related to linear and nonlinear partial differential equations                  arising in Riemannian geometry.  The work follows two main                      themes.  The first is concerned with the spectrum of the Laplace                operator on compact manifolds and boundary value problems for the               scalar curvature equation.  The main thrust of the research is                  the formulation and resolution of the Yamabe problem for                        manifolds with boundary.  The problem has been solved for                       manifolds without boundary; the presence of a boundary requires a               much more imaginative approach.  At this time, the formulation of               the correct questions is only being developed.  Good results in                 3, 4 and 5 dimensions have been obtained in the case of                         Riemannian manifolds. Work with a more geometric flavor will be                 done on                                                                         uniqueness questions for conformal deformation of metrics.  This                will extend a recent generalization of the theorem that any                     Riemannian manifold which supports a function whose Hessian is a                multiple of the metric and whose normal derivative vanishes on                  the boundary, must in fact be the upper hemisphere of the                       standard sphere.                                                                     Partial differential equations form the backbone of modern                 differential geometry.  Phenomena which involve continuous change               such as that seen in motion, curvature and higher dimensional                   analogues are known to obey certain general laws, expressible in                terms of the interactions and relationships between partial                     derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not to state the                   relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative and                           quantitative meaning from them and validate methods for                         expressing solutions.",
