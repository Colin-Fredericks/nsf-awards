 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed investigations is to characterize the               response of crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants to high                   light, with a particular emphasis on the employment of a novel                  photoreceptive process that involves several leaf carotenoids.                  This process, which is associated with the formation of zeaxanthin              from its precursors in the xanthophyll cycle, facilitates the safe              removal of an excess of absorbed light in photosynthetic organs.                The diurnal operation of the xanthophyll cycle will be                          characterized in several different types of plants that process                 CAM, including platyopuntias, rosette-forming yuccas, and two                   species which possess succulent leaves, Hoya australis and the fern             Pyrrossia confluens.  The acclimation of the carotenoid                         composition, and particularly the xanthophyll cycle, to different               light environments will be examined through a comparison of leaves              which have developed in deep shade versus those which have                      developed in full sunlight,  In addition, this question will be                 addressed by examining the acclimation of the carotenoid                        composition to the gradient in the light environment that occurs                within the leaves or cladodes.  The operation of the xanthophyll                cycle will furthermore be characterized in response to a                        combination of high light and chilling temperatures.  The                       utilization of the xanthophyll cycle in photoreceptive energy                   dissipation in these CAM species which are found in habitats that               experience high light will then be compared with that which occurs              in C3 species.",
