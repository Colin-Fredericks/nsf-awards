 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to investigate the  massive dolomitization of an                Upper Miocene reef complex cropping out in excellent three-                     dimensional exposures near Nijar, southeastern Spain.  This                     proposal is a renewal for an ongoing project focussing on regional              dolomitization of Upper Miocene reefs in Spain, previous work                   having studied reefs in Mallorca (Balearic Islands).  Work in                   Mallorca has narrowly constrained age of dolomitization, and field,             petrographic, geochemical modelling approaches have yielded a model             which invokes dolomitization of Messinian reefs by evaporitic                   basinal brines that formed as a result of the late Messinian                    \"salinity crisis\".  A  prime objective of the Nijar project is to               test the regional applicability of this model, by mapping dolomite              and dolomite type distributions within the context of the sequence              stratigraphy, and by applying petrographic, geochemical (C, O, Sr               isotopes; Ca, Mg, Na, Cl, SO4, Sr, Fe, Mn, Al, K abundances), and               quantitative modelling approaches.  Preliminary field and                       petrographic work at Nijar has shown similarities in sequence                   stratigraphy and dolomite fabrics to those in Las Negras (about                 20kms away), and in Mallorca.  The Nijar project will also test                 other dolomitization models involving meteoric and normal seawater.",
