 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, industrial and academic                                               researchers have developed a keen                                               interest in complex composite                                                   materials since they can exhibit                                                unusual and, when properly designed,                                            beneficial electromagnetic                                                      properties.  An example of this is                                              a chiral, or optically active,                                                  material which macroscopically is a                                             large collection of tiny, handed                                                inclusions randomly embedded in a                                               host medium.  The objective of this                                             research project is the development                                             of a deterministic capability for                                               macroscopically characterizing both                                             naturally-occurring and                                                         artificially-created chiral                                                     materials.  This capability is                                                  crucial in the design of these                                                  materials to optimize their                                                     beneficial electromagnetic                                                      characteristics.                                                                                                                                                This Research Initiative Award                                                  project will address this issue                                                 through a comprehensive program of                                              research which will combine                                                     computational methods with                                                      analytical models and techniques to                                             ascertain the effective constitutive                                            parameters.  The time-consuming and                                             computationally intensive numerical                                             simulations will be assisted by the                                             use of both equivalent boundary                                                 condition models and the                                                        implementation of parallel                                                      computational algorithms in order to                                            produce results which are both                                                  meaningful and temporally tractable.                                                                                                                            Once the effective descriptors are                                              known they will be applied to a wide                                            range of problems such as optical                                               fibers, devices and waveguides in                                               the optical frequency bands and                                                 absorbers and micropatch antenna                                                substrates at microwave frequencies.                                            Finally, experimental measurements                                              will be performed to both validate                                              these methods and results, and to                                               evaluate the accuracy of the                                                    macroscopic models.",
