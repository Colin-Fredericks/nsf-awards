 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to identify and purify the inhibitor protein (PKI)             of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A in fruit flies. A                        purification scheme similar to that used for mammalian PKI will be              employed. Fruit flies have a relatively simple genome and many                  mutants have been described, making them useful experimental                    organisms. After the PKI is purified, primers will be prepared in               order to obtain and sequence the gene. Gene expression in various               tissues and at various stages of development will be determined.                The PKI gene will be mutated to determine the resulting phenotype.              Potential roles of this gene in embryonic development, especially               in the nervous system and in pattern formation, will be examined.               Previously described mutants have been shown to have abnormal                   levels of cAMP. The proposed experiments will help elucidate the                role of PKI in regulating cAMP-dependent processes in fruit flies.              %%%                                                                             Mutants of fruit flies have been described which have altered cAMP              levels. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity is involved in             many cellular processes, changing the behavior of target proteins.              This proposal is to isolate and study the properties of a protein               (PKI) which inhibits PKA activity. The gene for PKI will then be                isolated, mutations will be made, and the phenotype of the flies                will be determined. Gene expression in various tissues and at                   various times in development will be measured. The information                  obtained should increase understanding of what roles PKA and PKI                play in development and pattern formation, and why regulation of                cAMP levels seems to be critical for many processes in fruit flies.",
