 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant hormone ethylene plays an important role in plant                     development and is a major component of a plants response to                    physical and biological stress.  This simple hydrocarbon molecule               provides an effective stress signal; its gaseous nature allows for              rapid diffusion of the hormone signal to both local and distant                 target sites where upon activation of stress and defense response               genes may aid in plant protection.  The ethylene-related mutants                of Arabidopsis thaliana are powerful tools for the genetic                      dissection of the ethylene signal transduction pathway.  Mutations              which affect hormone production, perception and signal transduction             will be examined.  The role of etheylene in plant stress and                    differential cell growth processes will be addressed using genetic,             molecular and biochemical approaches.  Our understanding of the                 mechanisms of hormone signal transduction will be greatly aided by              analysis of the Arabidopsis ethylene-related genes.  The molecular              cloning and characterization of genes which are required for                    regulation of ethylene production, perception and signal                        transduction is a major focus of this proposal.  The effects of                 ethylene-related mutations on hormone- and stress-regulated gene                expression will be examined using chimeric gene fusions and in situ             RNA hybridization.  The ability to resist bacterial pathogen attack             will also be investigated in these mutants.  Finally, to further                aid in the genetic dissection of the ethylene action pathway,                   pseudorevertant analysis will be initiated for genes which act at               different steps in the signal transduction process.  The                        characterization of interactions among ethylene receptors, effector             molecules and modulatory components at the genetic, molecular and               biochemical level should provide insight into the complex pathways              of hormone signal transduction.",
