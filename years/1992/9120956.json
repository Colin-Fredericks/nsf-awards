 "awd_abstract_narration": "A genetic approach to the investigation of the regulation and                   function of calcium channels is expected to increase our                        understanding of regulation of intracellular calcium ion that is                essential for the normal functioning of the brain, muscle and                   secretion of hormones.  At the present time, the mechanisms that                control whether these channels are open, allowing calcium to be                 moved across the membrane, or closed are largely unknown.  By                   selectively destroying one component (beta subunit) of the                      proteins that make up the structure of the channel the function                 of the channel can be determined directly from                                  electrophysiological or chemical studies of the movement of                     calcium into cells.  These experiments will be done using cells                 in culture.  Genetically altered mice will be produced that lack                this protein.  These experiments will extend the results obtained               in tissue culture to allow the determination of the role of this                protein in normal growth and development of the mouse.                          Understanding how calcium channels are controlled will provide                  valuable insight into their role in normal brain and muscle                     function.",
