 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year project, sponsored by the Joint Council on                      Economic Education, will support a nationwide teacher                           enhancement program whose objective is to prepare teachers                      to teach advanced placement economics in the high schools.                      The program will take place at four sites (University of                        California, Los Angeles; University of Minnesota; Purdue                        University; Clemson University) and 25 well prepared teach-                     ers will be selected from each region to attend a 2 1/2 day                     orientation session and a three week summer session.  The                       teachers will learn both content and instructional tech-                        niques and will also be prepared to be teacher trainers so                      that the regional workshops can be replicated at local                          sites.  In the second year of the project staff will devel-                     op a teacher training manual which can be used in the                           inservice activities.  In the third year the resources of                       the Joint Council will be used to help the teacher trainers                     carry out in-service programs to disseminate the curriculum                     locally.                                                                                                                                                        The matching funds provided by the Joint Council on Econom-                     ic Education constitute more than 122% of the NSF grant.",
