 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dispersal polymorphism (the occurrence of migratory and flightless              forms in the same population) is a widespread phenomenon among                  insects.  For most insects including planthoppers (Homoptera:                   Delphacidae), there is a reproductive cost associated with                      dispersal ability as evidenced by the reduced fecundity and delayed             oviposition of migratory compared to flightless females.                        Corresponding information for males on the relationship between                 dispersal ability and reproductive success is virtually absent.  As             a result, our understanding of the evolution, maintenance, and                  population consequences of variation in dispersal capability is                 based almost exclusively on females.  Failure to establish fitness              differences between male wing forms challenges our current                      knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary basis for the                      existence of dispersal polymorphisms.  Several characteristics of               planthopper mating systems suggest the presence of costs associated             with migratory ability in males and that migratory and flightless               males contribute differentially to population dynamics at different             densities.  The research outlined herein seeks to elucidate                     intrinsic differences between migratory and flightless males of the             planthopper Prokelisia dolus in their 1) competitive ability (male              / male interactions, ability to locate mates, attractiveness to                 females, 2) survivorship, propensity to disperse, ability to                    inseminate mates, and 3) mating success and contribution to                     population growth across a range of density conditions.  This                   research will supply the empirical basis for the development of                 more general hypotheses (which include both male and females) to                examine the widespread phenomenon of dispersal polymorphism in                  insects.",
