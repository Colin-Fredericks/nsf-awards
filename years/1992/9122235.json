 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop a new and powerful                   general methodology for posing and answering basic questions                    about optimal policies concerning the preservation of biological                diversity.  The theory will be broad enough to integrate a wide                 range of related subjects into a coherent whole, yet operational                enough to be useful for addressing practical empirical questions.               The theory is centered on the diversity function, a basic dynamic               programming equation that measures the diversity of a set of n                  objects or species as a function of n(n-1)/2 pair wise variables.               This function can be interpreted as determining the possible                    genetic distance or dissimilarity, or the probability of species                survival, depending on the context and intended application.                                                                                                    Theoretical applications will include the use of cost-benefit                   analysis in analyzing conservation issues, classification theory,               maximum likelihood estimation of evolutionary trees, entropy                    measures of diversity for ecological settings, the calculation of               diversity maximizing policies, and relations with portfolio                     diversification theory.  Practical computer packages will be                    prepared and applied to a series of actual conservation problems.               For example, the methodology will be applied to analyzing issues                concerned with the preservation of the 15 exiting species of                    cranes.  With the growing world-wide threat to a variety of plant               and animal species and their habitats, this research is                         particularly timely and important.",
