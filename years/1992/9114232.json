 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program will study control of the                                 chaotic dynamics of solid state laser systems that                              contain intracavity nonlinear elements.  These laser                            systems are rapidly finding important applications in                           optical communications and information processing,                              materials processing, medicine and laser radar.                                 Specific goals include novel pulsed operation and                               complex periodic waveform generation by                                         semiconductor and diode-pumped solid state lasers.                              These goals will be achieved through the development                            of control techniques that are applicable to chaotic                            systems.  Control algorithms that have very recently                            been developed by Ott, Grebogi and Yorke will be                                implemented on laser systems to obtain specific                                 complex waveforms that cannot be generated by                                   stable systems.  This will require novel electronic and                         optical techniques for fast feedback and control of                             laser parameters.  We will attempt to control                                   multimode laser systems and develop the techniques                              for switching between complex periodic waveforms,                               such as the antiphase states demonstrated recently in                           a diode-pumped solid state laser.  Such studies should                          have an impact not only on the development of new                               laser systems and optical communications, but on the                            control of systems of chemical reactions and                                    biological systems as well.  A fundamental                                      understanding of the statistical nature of chaotic                              dynamics and the influence of quantum noise in                                  chaotic lasers will be developed.",
