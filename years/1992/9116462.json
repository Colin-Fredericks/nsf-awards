 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continental margin accretionary complexes are sites of large-                   scale fluid transport of dissolved matter.  Deformation and                     compaction processes occuring in accretionary terranes are                      resposible for increasing pore pressures producing these large                  scale fluid-flows.  Temperature and pressure conditions  in these               areas are beleived to be responsible for the dehydration of                     hydrous minerals which then result in the formation of low                      chloride fluids.  Variations in chloride concentrations are an                  essential part of the observations used to infer preferential                   pathways and transient flow episodes in accretionary prisms.                    These poorly understood material-transport processes exert a                    first-order control on the geochemical and thermal balance of the               earth's reservoirs.                                                                                                                                             This award will support Dr. Dreiss' efforts to investigate the                  origin of low chlorinity fluids and to develop a combination of                 fluid and mass transport models in three acccretionary complexes                (Barbados, Nankai, and the Peru margin).  Dr. Dreiss proposes to                develop models which can can be used to test the hypothesized                   sources of low-chloride fluids and transport mechanisms with                    known information about site geometry, sediment permeabilities,                 and pore water compositions.  These models will provide indepen-                dent estimates of fluid flow which can be compared to those                     derived from heat transport studies.",
