 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines a three-year plan of research for (1)                    taking the final steps toward formulating and applying a path-                  integral approach to the collisional kinetics of the transition                 region between the thermosphere and exosphere, and (2)                          constructing geocoronal models with the goal for assessing the                  response of the exosphere to, and interaction with, thermospheric               variations and magnetospheric processes.  Throughout, the                       applications are geared toward observable or measurable                         quantities, based on the experience gained during the CHARM                     project that is currently winding down.  The specific tasks                     making up this proposal are:                                                    o    to complete the development of an algorithm for evaluating                      the kinetic distribution function of exospheric constituents                    in the transition zone between the exosphere and the                            collisionally-dominated thermosphere, and to incorporate                        this into realistic  kinetic models of the hydrogen                             geocorona taking into account elastic collisions of atmomic                     H with O and He and charge-exchange collisions with H+ and                      O+ using realistic topside ionosphere models,                              o    to carry out case studies of the interaction between the                        ring current and geocorona (beginning with quiet-time cases,                    using AMPTE-CCE -derived empirical models) to evaluate                          quantitatively the energetic particle flux onto the low- and                    mid-latitude thermosphere (and airglow emissions arising                        thereform), and in the case of storm-time ring current                          enhancements, to ascertain whether there is enough energy                       deposited into the thermosphere to affect the geocorona                         globally (i.e. to quantitatively investigated feedbacks),                  o    to further develop a radiative transfer code to address non-                    isothermal thermospheres and to carry out unified analyses                      of Lyman and Balmer datasets collected over the last two                        decades,                                                                   o    to compile geocoronal models into a consistent reference                        set, and to use this set to determine values for parameters                     defined within a recently-developed analytic modeling scheme                    as functions of geophysical and solar indices, thereby                          providing workers in other areas of geospace research with a                    convenient representation of the geocorona,                                o    and to continue the theoretical development of exospheres                       subject to non-gravitational forces to.",
