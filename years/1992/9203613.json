 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Eileen M. Spain has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship                  in Chemistry. Dr. Spain's doctoral degree was from Utah                         University under the supervision of Professor Michael Morse.                    She intends to continue her research with Professor Stephen                     Leone at The University of Colorado. Dr. Spain's career goal is                 to study electronic orbital alignment effects in the tranistion                 metal bond activation of small molecules such as hydrogen,                      oxygen, and methane. As a graduate student she studied the                      electronic structure of metal-metal bonds. In her postdoctoral                  work she will develop experiments using orbital alignment                       effects on chemical reactions.                                                  %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural progam designed to broaden the                     knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                    meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
