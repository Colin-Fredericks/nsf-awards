The purpose of the conference is to educate                    science teacher educators, science teachers, and professionals                  providing services and/or equipment to persons with disabilities                as to what resources and strategies are effective in providing                  science education for students with disabilities.                                                                                                               General goals of the conference are:                                                                                                                                 o    to assess the current state of conditions concerning                            science for persons with disabilities and to provide                            recommendations to Federal, state, and local agencies,                          institutions and organizations concerning science                               education for disabled students; and                                                                                                                       o    to increase awareness of technological advances and                             contributions which can enhance and contribute to the                           learning and participation of disabled students.                                                                                                      The conclusions and outcomes developed by participants in working               groups will be synthesized and shared with all attendees.  A                    position statement along with recommendations for improved                      practice will be communicated to the participants and their                     responses will be solicited.  Suggestions in areas of career                    concerns, teacher education, methods, materials/programs                        dissemination, evaluation and assessment, and educational                       organizations and agencies will be compiled and from the basis of               the document which will summarize conference proceedings.                                                                                                       Conference participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire               assessing the effectiveness of the conference.  A follow-up                     questionnaire will be mailed to all participants one year                       following the conference.  The purpose of this survey will be to                determine what changes have taken place in the participants'                    schools or regions to improve the quality of education and                      services for students with disabilities.",
