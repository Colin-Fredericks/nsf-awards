 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Subject of this research is the role of carbon/nutrient                     interactions as constraints on carbon cycling processes and                     overall carbon budgets of terrestrial ecosystems.  The specific                 focus is on carbon/nutrient interactions in three contrasting                   tundra ecosystems along a continuum from dry uplands to wet                     lowlands in northern Alaska.  The research is placed in the                     context of global warming, viewing the predicted global                         temperature increase as an experiment in carbon/nutrient                        interactions at the ecosystem level.                                                                                                                            The central idea is that primary production of arctic ecosystem                 is strongly nutrient-limited, and thus its ability to respond to                                                                                                higher temperatures is constrained by nutrient supply.  Soil                    respiration, on the other hand, is more directly limited by low                 soil temperature, as is the mineralization of nutrients in soil                 organic matter.  Plant carbon gains associated with increased                   nutrient mineralization must thus be balanced against soil carbon                                                                                               losses due to increased soil respiration.  To understand controls                                                                                               on carbon balance at the ecosystem level, one needs to understand                                                                                               controls on plant carbon/nutrient ratios and the ratio of soil                  carbon respiration to N and P mineralization.                                                                                                                   A program of research is proposed that includes process studies,                                                                                                whole- ecosystem experiments, and simulation modeling.  The                     process studies are designed to improve understanding of C/N/P                  interactions at key points in the cycle of organic matter in                    terrestrial ecosystems, with a particular focus on the balance of                                                                                               soil respiration and N and P mineralization.  The whole-                        ecosystem experiments are focused on determining correlations                   between changes in the C:N:P ratios of the major organic matter                 fluxes and organic matter pools.  The modeling efforts are                      designed to help explain these correlated changes in whole                      ecosystems, to identify cause-effect relationships, and to                      clarify constraints on the observed range of variation in C:N:P                 ratios.",
