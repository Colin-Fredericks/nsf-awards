The purpose of these visits would be to: analyze                                data from experiments at Fermi and Brookhaven                                   National Laboratories; collaboratively design,                                  prototype, and construct detectors for elementary                               particle physics experiments; plan future joint                                 ventures in high energy physics between the                                     United States and Mexico; and design laboratory-                                based experiments for undergraduate and graduate                                students, using elementary particle physics                                     techniques.                                                                                                                                                     IFUG has been collaborating with the University                                 of Massachusetts, Columbia University, and                                      Fermilab on elementary particle physics                                         experiments.  These experiments probe the nature                                of strong interaction physics by studying the                                   production of particles with various properties.                                Central to the experimental design are                                          specialized readout and analysis electronics                                    hardware which permit the acquisition of                                        unprecedented quantities of highly processed                                    data.  The Massachusetts-IFUG collaboration                                     focuses primarily on analyzing those data and                                   extracting physics results.  For the interchange                                necessary for data analysis, group members from                                 both countries periodically need to work                                        together.  The U.S. side, which has expertise and                               facilities in high energy physics research, would                               gain from the collaboration by having voluminous                                data from its major high energy laboratories                                    analyzed.  The Mexican side would benefit from                                  the joint work not only by being at the forefront                               of elementary particle research but also by                                     having an opportunity to train its physicists and                               participate in the planning of joint U.S.-Mexico                                activities in high energy physics.",
