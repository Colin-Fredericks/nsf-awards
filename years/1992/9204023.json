 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Czechoslovak research project between Dr. M. A.                         Van Hove of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and Dr. I. Bartos                      of the Institute of Physics of the Czechoslovakian Academy                      of Sciences will study diffraction of excited electron                          states and of dynamic processes on crystal surfaces.  The                       researchers will explore the dynamic electron processes at                      metal surfaces, which are relevant for understanding many-                      body effects that will clarify the behavior of electrons                        in lower-dimensional systems.  Such inelastic effects will                      be studied in the diffraction of low-energy electrons, by                       fitting model optical potentials to experimental data.                          Results may shed light on the electronic structure of                           unoccupied states above the vacuum level, such as the                           usual inelastic mean free path in transition metals at                          energies close to the vacuum level.  The work also should                       benefit the understanding of lifetimes in photochemistry                        cynamics at surfaces with adsorbates.  A further benefit                        would be better access to very light elements, principally                      hydrogen, which can induce surface reconstruction.  These                       results would be important in understanding catalysis,                          crystal growth and properties of nanostructures.                                                                                                                This research project in materials science fulfills the                         program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                          enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern                       Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources                      in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
