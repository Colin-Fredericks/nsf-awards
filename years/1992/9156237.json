 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project applies artificial intelligence techniques to                      implement the concept of intelligent attendants or guides whose                 behavior (even personality) can be made to depend upon the                      attributes of the learner.  The project accomplishes this by                    developing a SIMPLE (a set of many rooms) to accompany the                      first electronics course for students of electrical                             engineering.  The SIMPLE emphasizes providing quick and ample                   feedback to students about their performance on the analytical                  and problem-solving aspects of electronics, including both                      simple exercises and open-ended design problems.  The learner                   gets immediate feedback, as well as the benefits of learning                    independent self-assessment of work, on complex open-ended                      problems without direct participation by the instructor.  The                   goal is to immerse learners in an intensely interactive                         computer simulated environment related to the subject matter                    they wish to learn.  In the simulation, the learner sees a                      collection of connected \"rooms\" that may contain, at the                        pleasure of the instructor, informative notes and explanations                  (with graphics), project assignments, and tools (word                           processor, spreadsheet, text editor, and specialty software                     such as MathCAD and PSpice).  By touring the complex of rooms,                  the learner acquires knowledge, accomplishes tasks, and                         demonstrates competence by interacting with the simulated                       environment.  A key part of the effort is to publicize the                      SIMPLE and to provide relatively polished versions of several                   archetypical rooms (on floppy disks and over INTERNET) for the                  Plus/HyperCard environment to other faculty so that they can                    develop additional material for this and other courses.",
