 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, in microbiology, is a three year program that                     includes 1) Summer Institutes, held at Boston University, 2) a                  series of local workshops conducted by lead teachers, and 3)                    outreach presentations given by all institute participants.  The                program is built upon a highly successful pilot program, using                  published materials developed by the program.  Emphasis is on                   hands-on activities, including all participant and student                      activities.  The target audience is secondary biology teachers.                                                                                                 The Summer Institute offers two-week workshops for 20 potential                 lead teachers each year.  In addition, each year, 20 lead                       teachers, selected from a pool of previous participants attend a                one-week institute to prepare them to conduct one-week, local                   workshops.  These workshops are then presented by teams of two                  lead teachers during the following year.  Lead teachers also                    serve as local resource teachers.  Logistical support for these                 efforts is provided by a developing communications network and by               development of local support centers.                                                                                                                           Significant local cost sharing will be provided in support of the               local workshops.  Over 1000 participants will be served by the                  one or two week workshops and another 600 participants will                     participate in local outreach efforts of shorter duration.                                                                                                      An amount equal to 32.1% of NSF cost will be provided as cost                   share.",
