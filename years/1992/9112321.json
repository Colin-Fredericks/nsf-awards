The USSR Academy of                           Sciences' team is lead by Academician Igor A. Tarchevsky,                       Director, Kazan Institute of Biology; Professor V.I.                            Kefeli, Director, Institute of Soil Science and                                 Photosynthesis, Pushchino; and Academician A.A.                                 Krasnovsky, A. N. Bakh Institute of Biochemistry.                                                                                                               The American delegation will consist of 10 senior and 10                        junior scientists.  This proposal covers primarily the                          funding of the junior scientists (Ph.D. granted within                          past ten years.)                                                                                                                                                The topics covered in the workshop will include the                             biophysical, biochemical, physiological and ecological                          aspects of photosynthesis.  Attention will also be given                        to the processes affecting crop productivity.                                                                                                                   This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the US and the USSR to combine complementary efforts and                        capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and                             competence in the field of basic scientific research on                         the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of                            benefit.",
