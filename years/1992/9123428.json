This study                       responds to a directive in the Congressional conference report                  accompanying the NSF appropriation for fiscal year 1991 for such                a study.                                                                             COSEPUP, which has for 30 years served as a source of high                 level advice to science advisors and other senior government                    officials, has the broad experience required to undertake a study               of the criteria and procedures used by NSF in reviewing and                     awarding major grants.  The study will be conducted over a period               of 15 months under the direction of a panel of experts and result               in a report that assesses the current system and makes                          recommendations for improvements, as appropriate.",
