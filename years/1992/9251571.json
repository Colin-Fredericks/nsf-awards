 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital technology has revolutionized the way scientists                        approach the measurement and the analysis of experimental data.                 Today's laboratory instruments are capable of digitizing                        complex detector responses, produce instant numerical readouts,                 and transfer the information to a computer for further                          processing and permanent storage.  Once loaded into a computer,                 these datafiles can be accurately compared to theoretical                       expectations with relative ease using commonly available                        commercial software.  While such procedures are currently the                   norm in most research or industrial laboratories, they are                      often ignored in introductory physics laboratories where many                   aspiring science students gain their first and often last                       chance to study experimental methods in the physical sciences.                  This project is modifying an existing set of undergraduate                      laboratory experiments involving analog oscilloscopes, commonly                 performed at most institutions, to include an introduction to                   digital technology and computer data analysis.  The project is                  being implemented with the acquisition of analog/digital                        oscilloscopes, IBM compatible personal computers, and commonly                  available scientific software for these computers.",
