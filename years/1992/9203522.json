 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three investigators are engaged in this research project in                low-dimensional topology.  (i) Scharlemann intends to apply the new             research tools of \"thin position,\" combinatorics of surface                     intersections, and sutured manifold theory to several problems in               the theory of knots and graphs in 3-space and of Heegaard                       splittings of 3-manifolds.  Of particular interest are methods for              determining and characterizing knotting of graphs in 3-manifolds,               for applying these tools to the graphs which arise naturally in                 Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds, and, in the relatively simple               case in which the graphs consist of simple closed curves,                       understanding how the topology changes under a process called Dehn              surgery.  (ii) Long plans to examine several interrelated questions             in the theory of low-dimensional manifolds, braid groups, and                   representation varieties.  The specifics concern representations of             the fundamental groups of 3-manifolds and applications of these to              boundary slopes and Property P, as well as the braid groups and                 their representations.  (iii) Cooper intends to study ties of low-              dimensional topology to hyperbolic geometry.  The connection                    between incompressible surfaces in knot complements and the Newton              polygons of the SL2(C) knot polynomial provides a method of getting             at deep information about the topology of knot complements.  The                hyperbolic gluing equations for a knot complement provide another               means to approach the same problem.  Hodgson's formula for the                  hyperbolic volume form provides a closed 1-form on any curve given              by a polynomial in the longitude and meridian eigenvalues.  The                 exactness of this volume form on a curve arising from a knot puts               strong conditions on which polynomials arise this way.  Following               these leads, Cooper expects to find mutant knots with distinct                  SL2(C) polynomials, even without being able to calculate these                  polynomials explicitly.                                                              Knots are rather elementary geometric objects whose really                 interesting properties are topological.  By this we mean that two               geometric knots do not differ in an interesting way if one of them              can be transformed to look just like the other without cutting or               untying it, just by pushing its string about to rearrange the                   crossings.  Nevertheless, it is not a trivial matter to recognize               when one complicated geometric knot is topologically different from             another, rather than just a different geometric realization.  This              problem can be addressed by computing certain numbers or                        polynomials which are called \"topological invariants,\" meaning that             they always have the same value for different geometric                         realizations of the same topological knot.  The problem would be                reduced to pure algebra if there were one invariant which also                  always had different values for geometric realizations of different             topological knots, but life is not so simple -- no single invariant             achieves this ideal, nor even all the known invariants taken                    together.  It is therefore valuable to investigate new invariants,              some of the most useful being those inspired in recent years by                 ideas from quantum physics. In particular, applications of knot                 theory to the biology of long strands of DNA have drawn upon                    knowledge of these newer invariants.",
