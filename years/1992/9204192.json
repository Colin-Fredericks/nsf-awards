 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is devoted to various algebraic and                  geometric aspects of the equations of continuum mechanics and                   mathematical physics.  The principal areas of concentration                     include the equations of linear and nonlinear elasticity, Lie                   algebras and quasi-exactly solvable quantum problems, the Cartan                equivalence method, bi-Hamiltonian systems, solitary waves, and                 nonlinear dissipation.  Specific applications include: 1.                       Conservation laws, symmetries, canonical forms and invariants for               the variational problems of linear and nonlinear elasticity,  2.                The classification of Lie algebras of differential operators and                quasi-exactly solvable Schrodinger operators,  3. Canonical                     forms and integrability of bi-Hamiltonian systems, 4. Nonlinear                 dissipation and normal forms for both ordinary and partial                      differential equations,  5. Equivalence problems from the                       calculus of variations, and 6. Existence and non-existence of                   solitary wave solutions to higher order model evolution                         equations.                                                                           These research topics are relevant to the studies of                       important problems arising from fluid mechanics, elasticity, and                quantum mechanics.  Particular problems to be addressed include                 the investigation of solitary wave solutions to certain model                   equations for water waves, classification and application of a                  new and physically important class of quantum  mechanical                       systems, understanding dissipation (friction and viscosity) in                  mathematical models of nonlinear systems, and the analysis of                   symmetry and conservation laws for linear and nonlinear                         elasticity.",
