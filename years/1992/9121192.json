 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phenomenon of \"neglect\" refers to the fact that following                   damage to one side of the cerebral cortex, there is a failure to                attend to the opposite side of the body and corresponding visual                space.  The sensory and motor deficits that result in neglect are               poorly understood and have not been adequately localized to                     specific cortical regions.  In this award, Dr. Mittleman will                   develop a model system for the separation of sensory from motor                 deficits as well as for determining the relative involvement of                 various cortical area in the phenomenon of neglect.  This research              will use behavioral paradigms involving the detection of visual                 stimuli either by lateralized or by unlateralized motor responses               that enable a separation and quantification of sensory and motor                factors in sensorimotor neglect produced by cortical damage.  An                important result of these studies will be the assessment of the                 relative contributions of individual ares of the cortex in                      sensorimotor neglect following cortical damage.  This research will             contribute fundamental knowledge about how the brain reacts to                  damage in specific areas.",
