 "awd_abstract_narration": "The medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus is known to                  exhibit sexual dimorphism in a number of mammalian systems,                     including humans.  Moreover, sex differences have been revealed in              several neurochemical systems, including the endogenous opioid                  peptides and their receptors.  Evidence suggests that hypothalamic              opioid peptides influence neuroendocrine physiology and behavior.               Dr. Hammer will examine the regulation of brain opioid peptide and              receptor systems by gonadal steroid hormones in identified neuronal             circuits of the hypothalamus.  Using state-of-the-art                           neuroanatomical and molecular biological techniques, he will                    describe and characterize changes in the regulation of opiate                   receptor expression in specific brain regions and neurons during                estrus.  After determining the precise localization of these                    receptors, which are the functional site of action for opioid                   peptides, he will identify the various populations of opioid                    neurons that project to this important hypothalamic region.  These              studies will provide novel information about the anatomy and                    steroid sensitivity of opioid hypothalamic circuits.  The results               will lead to a greater understanding of the basic mechanisms                    underlying  the control of neuroendocrine function, and how                     disruption of this mechanism by aberrant hormonal or narcotic                   action could produce reproductive or other neuroendocrine                       disorders.",
