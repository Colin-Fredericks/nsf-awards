 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human biology is the basis for a tenth grade, activity-based                    biology course.  The major goals of the course are to                           understand those characteristics which are unique to the                        human species and which are shared with other living                            systems, to understand the place of humans in the biosphere                     and the consequences of our interactions with the                               environment, and to understand the place of humans in                           evolution and the consequences of our interactions with                         other species and the environment on the evolutionary                           process.  The course is informed by science reform movements                    and stresses understanding concepts and processes over                          vocabulary.  The content will emphasize major biological                        themes as identified in curriculum frameworks:  evolution,                      genetic continuity, patterns of organizations,                                  bioenergetics, regulation, behavior, development, forms and                     function, biodiversity, and ecology.  The course, designed                      for all students and schools, is organized about topics                         which concern students:  the human species, the human                           organism, human physical performance, human life cycle,                         human population, and human adaption.  It incorporates                          laboratory activities, and instructional technologies and                       employs modified learning cycle and modern assessment                           strategies.  Materials include a student textbook, a student                    resource book, teacher's guide, an assessment package and an                    implementation guide.",
