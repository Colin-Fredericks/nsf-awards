 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for travel support for scientists from                            the former Soviet Union to attend the Fifth                                     International Vacuum Microelectronics Conference,                               in Vienna, Austria, July 13-15, 1992.  The Vacuum                               Microelectronics Conference provides a focused                                  scientific forum to address research topics in this                             relatively new and emerging technological field.                                The scope of the conference includes fundamental                                theoretical and experimental physics in such topics                             as non-equilibrium electron transport in 3-D                                    nanostructures, quantum mechanical tunneling                                    through thin surface layers of insulators, metals,                              and semiconductors, and theoretical descriptions of                             surface tunneling.  It also includes the physics of                             field emission from layered materials and                                       fabrication and processing physics of                                           nanostructures, and the physics and chemistry of                                micromachining.  For a number of years, scientists                              from the former Soviet Union have been leaders in                               this field, and their participation is considered to be                         central to the success of the conference, considering                           their contributions to the field with respect to                                creativity, technical merit, and scientific                                     significance.  However, the recent events in the                                FSU have left their institutes without resources to                             provide travel to the conference even for their                                 leading researchers.  The request to NSF to provide                             travel funds to bring many of these leading                                     scientists to the meeting is highly appropriate at                              this time, given the turbulent economic situation in                            the FSU and our desire to foster closer contact                                 with quality scientific groups in these countries.                              The funds requested of NSF will be dispersed by                                 the International Committee based on a priority                                 listing of up to 20 scientists attached to this                                 proposal.",
