 "awd_abstract_narration": "As biomedical technology has progressed, it has become                     increasingly important to develop materials for internal use in                 the body, either as prostheses or as drug delivery devices, or as               interfaces with body solutions like blood.  The objective of the                State/Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for the                   Enhancement of the Biology/Biomaterials Interfaces at the                       University of Texas at San Antonio is to perform studies                        concerning the mechanisms which are involved in cellular response               to biomaterials as well as to design and develop new materials                  and prototype devices.  The major research topics include: (1)                  response of cells to hydrostatic pressure and materials, (2)                    bioresorption of biodegradable materials, (3) cardiac prostheses                calcification and colonization, (4) bacterial biofilm formation,                (5) drug delivery from oxide forming metals, (6) electrochemical                integrity of implants, and (7) tissue adaptation to materials.                  The research will be carried out in collaboration with a number                 other institutions in the area.  Twenty large, medium and small                 companies will be the initial members of the industrial                         partnership.  Technology transfer will occur through information                exchange, and test and evaluation performed by the companies.",
