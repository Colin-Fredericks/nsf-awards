 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant growth substance abscisic acid is involved in a number                of physiological responses, such as closure of stomata, seed                    maturation and dormancy, amelioration of environmental stresses                 through gene activation, etc.  During water stress there is a large             increase in the content of abscisic acid.  To understand the many               roles of abscisic acid in plants, it is essential to know how its               concentration is regulated at the tissue and cellular level.  This              project deals with the biosynthesis and catabolism of abscisic                  acid.  Biochemical as well as genetic approaches are proposed.  The             research is based on the hypothesis that all abscisic acid in green             plants is derived by oxidative cleavage of 9-cis-epoxy-carotenoids              and that the cleavage step is stimulated by water stress.                       Objectives are 1) to identify the cleavage substrate(s) and                     products; 2) to prepare a cell-free system for the cleavage enzyme;             3) to isolate novel biosynthetic mutants in Arabidopsis; 4) to                  purify the enzyme that converts abscisic acid to phaseic acid; 5)               to select for a mutant in Arabidopsis that is blocked in the                    conversion of abscisic acid to phaseic acid; and 6) to determine                the mechanism by which different osmotica stimulate abscisic acid               biosynthesis in the wall-less alga Dunaliella.  Once the pathways               for abscisic acid synthesis and degradation have been worked out,               it will be possible to find out at the biochemical and molecular                level how a water deficit stimulates abscisic biosynthesis, and how             restoration of turgor results in the conversion of abscisic acid                to phaseic acid.  These studies are therefore of interest in                    connection with the response of plants to drought.",
