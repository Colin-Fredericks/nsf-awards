Dr. Raftery received his Ph.D. for work                    with Alexander Pines at Berkeley. He will be working with Robin                 Hochstrasser at Pennsylvania in order to learn about the                        application of ultrafast infrared laser spectroscopy to the                     study of energy transfer at the surface of adsorbates on metals                 and semiconductor nanoclusters. This represents a new direction                 for which Dr Raftery is well-prepared from his graduate studies                 applying NMR to motions at surfaces.                                            %%%                                                                             This is the first year of a postdoctoral fellowship award to                    Dr. Michael Raftery. He will be studying basic properties of                    adsorbates. These materials have the potential of improving the                 quality and performance of electrical circuits and could have a                 wide range of applications to the miniaturization of                            electronics.",
