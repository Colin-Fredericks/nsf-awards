 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software environments to aid in the prototyping of protocols and           distributed algorithms are increasingly important as networking                 expands.  Powerful techniques for specification and validation are              needed.  A prototyping environment called SPANNER, based on a coupled           finite state machine model, was shown to be useful for precisely                specifying and validating small coordination problems.  This award              explores the development of a more powerful development environment by          extending the specification capabilities of the SPANNER system and by           implementing a distributed version of the enhanced system.  The                 specification capabilities are being enhanced by allowing dynamic               activation of modules, constraint-based specifications, and multiple            time bases.  The goal is to continue to be able to validate such                specifications for safety and liveness properties.  The distributed             implementation is designed to be able to validate larger and more               complex protocols in a shorter amount of time.  The ideas being                 developed and tested during the course of this work should be of use            to prototyping environments developed by other researchers.",
