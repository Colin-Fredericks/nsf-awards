 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Brookings Panel on Economic Activity aims to focus                          macroeconomic research on problems confronting the U.S. economy.                The Panel strives to fulfill this purpose by generating,                        discussing, and publishing high quality, relevant and timely                    research of macroeconomic significance.  Its first commitment is                to produce quality research, and the Panel's method of operation                is designed with that goal foremost in mind.  Its published                     research undergoes a much more intensive process of review,                     criticism, discussion and editing than conventional journals can                provide.  In this process and in the section of topics and authors,             the directors of the Panel are aided by the Panel Advisers, a group             of experts spanning a broad range of philosophical views and                    methodological preferences.                                                                                                                                     The Panel does not pursue highly abstract and purely theoretical                modeling of economic relationships which cannot be treated against              data and actual experience.  But subject to that constraint, its                notion of relevance is broad.  It includes research to explore                  fundamental characteristics of the economy and how it responds to               policy, as well as more applied research aimed at clarifying and                quantifying economic relationships.  It is concerned with issues                affecting economic performance broadly, including areas such as                 long-run growth, global interdependence, and energy policy, as well             as the range of issues associated with business cycles and economic             stabilization.",
