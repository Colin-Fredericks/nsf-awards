 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry is purchasing 8 microcomputers with                 associated peripherals and sofware for use in laboratory                        courses in general chemistry, physical chemistry, and                           instrumental analysis.  These laboratory courses are                            coordinated with one another so that students receive the                       benefits of a coherent introduction to the applications of                      computers in chemistry; including data analysis, interfacing to                 experiments, and theoretical computations.  As part of this                     project, new computer-based experiments are being developed for                 these labs.  In addition to their use in specific courses,                      these computers are available to all chemistry students at all                  unscheduled times.In the general chemistry course, students are                 introduced to computers for data collection, analysis and                       problem solving; including exposure to spreadsheet, graphing                    and equation-solving software.  Various transducers, such as                    thermistors, thermocouples, and photodiodes are used.  In the                   quantitative analysis course, experiments are performed                         involving anion analysis by high performance liquid                             chromatography.  In the instrumental analysis course,                           instruction in the use of computers for data acquisition,                       control, and analysis build upon the experience gained in                       earlier courses.  In the physical chemistry course, the                         geometry and vibrational frequencies of a molecule, such as SO2                 are calculated.",
