 "awd_abstract_narration": "RUI:  Vortex Arrays in Superconducting Multilayers - in the current             context, a vortex is a tube of magnetic field which penetrates the              bulk of a superconducting material.  The structure, distribution,               and elastic properties of vortices in superconducting multilayer                materials is of fundamental importance to both their physical                   characterization and to their potential for technological                       applications.  Vortex arrays play a role in determining the upper               and lower critical magnetic fields for multilayer superconductors.              Intrinsic and extrinsic pinning of vortices due to layering or to               defects at interfaces is likely to be of great importance for                   understanding of superconducting multilayers.  Similar issues, such             as the flow and creep of vortices in the presence of a transport                current and the melting of a flux lattice, currently limit the                  application of high-Tc superconductors.  The proposal is to study               the effects vortices have on Josephson-coupled multilayers                      consisting of alternating layers of superconducting sheets and                  insulating layers.  Using Ginzburg-Landau theory, the properties                listed above will be studied for real materials in realistic                    environments.  The results are expected to be relevent to high-Tc               materials.                                                                      %%%                                                                             Superconductors are of particular interest to materials science                 because they represent both a splendid example of a quantum                     mechanical phase transition and a unique class of materials having              many potential applications.  Under conditions of high magnetic                 field (or high current density), some superconductors become                    threaded by small tubular regions of normal material, called                    vortices.  One class of superconducting materials which admits                  vortices consists of thin layers of superconductor separated by                 thin layers of normal material.  This is a common configuration for             superconducting materials intended for real-world applications.                 Understanding the properties of such materials well enough to                   predict and utilize their special nature is crucial to developing               applications for both typical and the high-Tc superconductors.                  This is the goal of the current study.",
