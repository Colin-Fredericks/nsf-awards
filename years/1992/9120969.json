 "awd_abstract_narration": "People are able to perceive objects and boundaries successfully,                despite the fact that the visual input on which that perception is              based is fragmentary across both space and time.  For instance,                 despite the fact that objects are occluded a great deal by other                objects and that patterns projected on the retina change                        continually whenever objects or observers move, people can                      ordinarily detect complete boundaries and shapes.  There are other              cases in which people perceive boundaries in the absence of local               visual information, known as illusory contours and transparency                 phenomena.  This project will address the various cases of boundary             interpolation; it will test and refine a proposed unifying theory               and extend that theory from static, two-dimensional displays to the             three-dimensional case and to cases in which boundaries are                     obtained from information conveyed by motion.  The project will                 also investigate convergent methods to assess boundary perception,              including both perceptual report and objective performance                      measures.  This research, in addition to its implications for                   understanding human perception of objects, will aid in the                      construction of object and boundary detection methods in computer               vision systems.",
