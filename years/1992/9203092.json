The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit              by Dr. Curt M. Pfarr to work with Dr. Moshe Yaniv of the                        Department of Biotechnology, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France.                                                                                                  While the Jun Proteins are thought to function by binding to DNA                and interacting with other nuclear factors, the molecular details of            these interactions are still poorly understood.  In addition, how the           amount of each Jun varies under different growth conditions and                 where Jun is compartmentalized within the cell is presently                     unknown.  Dr. Pfarr will use three experimental approaches to                   address these questions using cultured cells as a model.  They are              1) localization of Jun proteins; 2) Inducible overexpression of Jun;            and 3) affinity-probe analysis of cell extracts.  By this concerted set         of experiments he hopes to reveal novel aspects of Jun function and             further clarify the complex control pathways of cell proliferation.                                                                                             The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel, a stipend for twelve months and a dependents' allowance.",
