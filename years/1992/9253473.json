 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shedd Productions, Inc. will produce a 38 minute 70 mm                          IMAX/OMNIMAX film which uses multicultural music to stimulate                   audiences' interest in the physics, physiology, math and                        technology of music and sound.  The film will be a musical                      science investigation of what music is, why we respond to it,                   and what it means in the lives and diverse cultures of people                   around the world.  By exploring together music's scientific                     structure and its variety of human interpretations, WHY IS                      MUSIC MUSIC? will show the dynamic relationships between                        science, technology, art, and culture.  Hands-on science                        materials will be developed for general audiences and middle                    school classrooms to encourage in-depth exploration of the                      science and math concepts presented in the film.  Model                         teacher training workshops for middle school music and science                  teachers will be held with the opening of the film in each                      venue to increase teachers' effectiveness with the hands-on                     materials.  To enhance the educational effectiveness of future                  large-format films, comprehensive evaluations of WHY IS MUSIC                   MUSIC? and the accompanying classroom curriculum  will be made                  available.  This film will be distributed through the national                  and international network of science centers that house                         IMAX/OMNIMAX theaters, and may be seen by approximately 14                      million viewers during the first five years.",
