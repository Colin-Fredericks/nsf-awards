 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                       research project between Professor V. Ralph Algazi, Department of               Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California,                  Davis, and Professor Yasuhiko Yasuda, Institute of Industrial                   Science, University of Tokyo.  Other scientists involved in this                collaboration are Professors Gary Ford and Todd Reed of the                     University of California, Davis, and two scientists from the                    Nagaoka University of Technology, Niigata (Professor Makoto                     Miyahara and Kazumori Kotani) and two scientists from the Tokyo                 Institute of Technology (Professors Shigeo Tsujii and Yoshinori                 Sakai).                                                                                                                                                         The research focuses on areas pertinent to high quality image and               video analysis, processing, transmission, recording, storage, and               display for natural and computer generated images, and the use of               high speed multimedia networks in an integrated digital system                  environment.  The commercial growth of High Definition                          Television (HDTV) will support this development by providing                    components and subsystems at new levels of quality and                          performance and at decreasing costs.  As a result of this project,              researchers at UC Davis and the two Japanese universities hope to               develop a framework for future interaction, using network                       communications with specialized equipment, and to pursue other                  research topics in high quality imaging and coding.",
