 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aspires to further our understanding of ventilatory                control in mammals, with special regard to changing body                        temperature and extreme conditions of gas exchange. Small bats will             primarily be used because they are uniquely suited for revealing                the processes of ventilatory control under these conditions. The                extreme energetic demands of flight provide a system in which to                probe the upper limits of mammalian respiratory function. In                    addition, the ability of small bats to reduce their body                        temperature and metabolism through torpor permits the exploration               of ventilatory control when operating in its most reduced extreme.              Exploring ventilatory control processes in whole animals is often               thwarted by the experimental process itself, because ventilatory                control is subject to conscious override. However, a further                    advantage of torpor is that it provides a state in which                        ventilatory processes may be investigated free from conscious                   interference, thus assuring dependable data. Experiments will be                performed using a variety of innovative techniques specially                    designed for bats. This study will help elucidate physiological                 control mechanisms regulating 1) unusually low and high metabolic               states, 2) different patterns of ventilation, and 3) the adaptation             to environmental changes. This investigation of undisturbed                     integrated function will also provide important corroboration of                investigations that involve non-intact ventilatory components and               more invasive techniques.",
