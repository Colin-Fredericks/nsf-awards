 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global changes, such as the internationalization of business, have              a major impact on the organization of the legal profession.  At the             same time, the legal profession, like other professions that                    transcend national boundaries, influences transnational movements,              including the trend towards open markets and democratic governance.             This conference grant brings together an international team of                  sociologists and historians to study the historical engagement of               the legal profession in transnational movements related to liberal              democratic governance. Specifically, the research team, drawn from              North America and Europe, devise a collaborative research strategy              to investigate the intersections between an evolving legal                      profession and the irregular expansion of democratic governance,                and complete a series of papers addressing a common set of                      questions related to these intersections.                                                                                                                       The study of the engagement of the legal profession in social and               political movements has largely been confined to local and national             settings.  This team project will add a transnational dynamic by                examining historical instances of the profession's involvement with             the struggle between universalizing and localizing political                    movements associated with liberal democratic governance.  These                 studies provide the basis for devising a model to investigate the               role of legal professions in contemporary political                             transformations, especially those underway in Eastern Europe, South             America, and Africa.  Therefore, the project provides a new                     historical context for studying the political engagement of the                 legal profession, and a model for investigating the profession's                engagment in a new wave of political transformations underway that              have both transnational and local roots.",
