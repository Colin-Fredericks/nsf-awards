In response to the congestion problem in cities, the topic of the               first symposium was vehicular traffic theory.  This has been the                focus of the series, since the pressing need for congestion relief              has not disappeared, and advanced in traffic science can open the               door for solutions that do not require the construction of more and             more facilities.  With the same goal in mind, recent symposia have              examined subjects related to traffic flow, encompassing passenger               transportation modes other than the automobile.  The Berkeley                   symposium will continue this tradition, seeking papers in                       intelligent vehicle/highway systems (IVHS) and freight/logistics.                                                                                               The distinguishing feature of this symposium series is that it                  deals exclusively with the scientific aspects of transportation and             traffic phenomena.  As such it provided the World's                             transportation/traffic theorists with their main forum.",
