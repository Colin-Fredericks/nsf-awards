Andrews Experimental Forest is an                                interdisciplinary research site operated by Oregon State                        University, and actively used by collaborating researchers from                 OSU, the University of Washington, the U. S. Forest Service, the                U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, USGS, and other                           universities.  The site is located in Willamette National Forest,               and is one of 17 NSF-supported Long-Term Ecological Research                    Sites and the venue for an NSF Research Experience for                          Undergraduates Site.  The PI requests support for a CNS analyzer,               a soil/tissue sample mill, and a microcomputer for data                         acquisition.  These instruments would be available to resident                  and visiting investigators in the Station's Plant/Soil Analysis                 Lab.                                                                                 The proposed instrument acquisition would add sulfur                       analysis to the Lab's capabilities, increase the number of                      analyses performed at the Station, decrease the size of the                     samples that could be analyzed, and decrease the per sample cost                of chemical analysis.  These analyses are critical to the studies               of wood decomposition and chemical flux through ecosystems that                 are underway at the Forest.  Acquisition of this instrument will                have a significant beneficial impact on many current and future                 research projects.",
