 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research effort will implement a \"smart cameras\" (Fast 3D                  imaging camera, or F3D1) which will generate a full range map of                a manufacturing scene in real time with virtually no computation                required.  The same camera will also continue to function as a                  normal intensity based camera and can be switched from intensity                to range mode by switching a single binary line.  Today's robots                exploit cameras to capture images of the objects which require                  manipulation by the robot, and attempt to use that image data to                learn the exact position of parts, to identify problems, to                     inspect parts, to detect proximity, etc.  One of the problems                   which limits the use of machine vision in manufacturing                         environments is that camera images are two dimensional and the                  objects which must be manipulated are three dimensional.  Three                 dimensional information is essential in most realistic                          applications, hence numerous techniques have been explored to                   generate depth information from 2D camera images.  None of these                techniques is ideal for factory application because each is                     either slow, costly, or inaccurate, or fails to work on objects                 that are specular.  The novel technology being developed for the                F3D1 camera could have important applications in manufacturing                  and other settings.",
