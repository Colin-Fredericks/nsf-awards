One of these volumes will examine the main                   social and economic changes that have occurred in the 1980s, and                the other will assess the status of the many diverse groups that                make up American society.  Among the major trends covered in                    Volume I will be changes in family structure and the rise of                    female-headed families, educational attainment and skills levels,               employment and the distributions of earnings and income.  Volume                II on social diversity will cover gender differences in                         education, economic participation and family responsibility,                    differences in the well-being of children and the elderly, racial               and ethnic differences in educational and economic achievement,                 and the increasing diversity of the American population brought                 on by the large wave of immigration that continued in the 1980s.                                                                                                     The 1990 Census Monographs will provide a wealth of                        information about social and economic changes during the 1980s.                 As its predecessors based on earlier Census data, the 1990 Census               Monographs will be extremely useful for teachers, students,                     decisionmakers, and researchers.",
