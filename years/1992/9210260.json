 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will implement systems software to support                         irregular parallel programs on scalable multiprocessors.                        Machines with physically distributed memory offer the best                      opportunity for scalable performance, but current programming                   techniques for these machines are cumbersome and often                          inefficient.  This is particularly true for applications with                   irregular data structures or irregular patterns of                              communication and control.  Two issues of primary concern are                   data layout and scheduling.  Data layout is critical to                         avoiding communication overhead, but good layout strategies                     are difficult to determine during compilation because they                      depend on global properties of the program and on input data.                   Similarly, scheduling for irregular problems must adapt to                      varying loads during program execution.  For both problems,                     there is a trade-off between the inflexibility of decisions                     made during compilation and the overhead of decisions made at                   runtime.  High level language mechanisms to allow the                           programmer to specify data layout and scheduling strategies,                    and implement them using a combination of compiler and runtime                  support will be developed.  The emphasis will be on irregular                   applications:  the layouts, for example, will describe the                      placement of subgraphs of a logically global graph, and the                     scheduling primitives will allow for both control and data                      parallelism.  Throughout the project's duration applications                    to motivate and test the systems work will be developed.",
