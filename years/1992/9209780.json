 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental characteristic of the nervous system is the                       modification of function in response to a number of stimuli.                    Neurotransmitters are molecules responsible for communication in                the nervous system; therefore, regulation of neurotransmitter                   synthesis is an important aspect of neural modification.  Examples              of short- and long-term regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis                are numerous, but in many cases the underlying mechanisms are not               understood.  Tyramine-beta-hydroxylase is the decisive enzyme                   required for the synthesis of octopamine, a transmitter of insects.             In insects that undergo diurnal as well as developmental changes of             their nervous system, octopamine and Tyramine-beta-hydroxylase are              not static but vary in both short- and long-term cycles.  The aim               of this study is to investigate the mechanism of these changes in               a simple, model nervous system.  Molecular probes of                            Tyramine-beta-hydroxylase will be developed by purifying and                    sequencing the enzyme for the development of antibodies to the                  enzyme.  The molecular basis of its regulation will be determined               by biochemical kinetic analysis, enzyme activity and changes that               occur during the diurnal cycle and during development.  The results             of these studies will contribute to our understanding of the                    mechanism that regulate neurotransmitter synthesis.",
