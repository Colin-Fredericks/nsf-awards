 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonuniformity of memory access is an almost inevitable feature of the           memory architecture in shared memory designs that can scale to large            numbers of processors, creating the increasingly important class of             NUMA (nonuniform memory access time) multiprocessors.  Managing the             placement and movement of code and data is crucial to performance in            NUMA architectures.  This has been called the NUMA Problem.  The I/O            bottleneck problem is also exacerbated by parallel architectures which          widen the gap between processing speed and disk speed even beyond that          created by improved processor technology.                                                                                                                       This project investigates operating system mechanisms and policies for          the management of the various levels of shared storage in such large-           scale shared memory multiprocessors.  The specific projects divide              into the following classes:  main memory management (both traditional           virtual memory and the migration and replication of pages among                 various main memory modules), parallel file system design, workload             characterization and performance evaluation methodology and the role            of the programming environment in solving the NUMA Problem.",
