 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been great progress recently in the                                   creation of artificial three-dimensional dielectric                             structures which are to photon waves as                                         semiconductor crystals are to electron waves.  That is,                         these photonic crystals have a photonic bandgap, a                              band of frequencies in which electromagnetic waves                              are forbidden, irrespective of propagation direction in                         space.  A face-centered-cubic photonic crystal has                              recently been introduced, fabricated, and studied                               experimentally and theoretically.  The experimental                             findings for the photonic band structure and for the                            attenuation length within the band gap are in                                   excellent agreement with our calculated results.                                Photonic bandgap materials inhibit the spontaneous                              absorption and emission of photons of the                                       frequencies concerned and have many potential                                   applications in device physics.  Examples are zero-                             threshold semiconductor lasers, highly efficient                                heterojunction bipolar transistors and highly reliable                          light-emitted-diodes.  Moreover, very compact high-                             Q resonators can be made with these materials for                               applications from millimeter to ultraviolet                                     wavelengths by introducing defects into the structure.                          We will continue to search for photonic band gap                                materials with specific photonic band gap structures                            tailored to particular applications.  We will also                              calculate the effects of these materials on a variety of                        optical, atomic and chemical processes.",
