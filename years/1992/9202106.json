 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ecological success of the blue-green bacterium Trichodesmium                species suggests that this cyanobacterium possesses unique                      characteristics that confer an ecological advantage in the warm,                nutrient-poor waters of tropical and subtropical oceans.                        Furthermore, this filamentous cyanobacterium without heterocysts                dominates the free-living nitrogen (N2) fixing cyanobacterium found             in the open ocean.  It is also the only nonheterocystic                         cyanobacterium that fixes molecular nitrogen in the light, while                evolving oxygen through photosynthesis.  Results from previous                  studies on the molecular biology of Trichodesmium have provided a               firm basis for studying its genetic, biochemical, and ecological                aspects.  This project addresses three important issues of                      Trichodesmium biology and ecology.  First, what is the genetic                  variability among Trichodesmium populations with different colony               morphologies?  Second, what mechanisms are involved in its ability              to maintain oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase activity while evolving                oxygen?  And third, is the ecological success of Trichodesmium due              to its reduced susceptibility to virus infection that is related to             extensive modification of Trichodesmium DNA?  These issues will be              addressed from biochemical and molecular approaches, using                      molecular probes and antisera developed earlier for Trichodesmium               populations.//",
