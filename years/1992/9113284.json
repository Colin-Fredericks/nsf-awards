 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. W. A. Coles and two graduate students of                the University of California at San Diego to collaborate in space               physics research with Ruth Esser and others of the Auroral                      Observatory, University of Tromso, Norway, Egil Leer of Oslo,                   Jussi Markkanen of Finland, and Eckart Marsch of the Max Planck                 Institute for Aeronomy, Lindau, Germany.  Much of the leading                   theoretical work on solar wind acceleration is now done in Europe               (notably in Norway and at this German institute.)  The U.S. PI and              his students will benefit substantially from the opportunity to work            directly with these leading theorists.  Together they propose to                continue observations of the solar wind velocity that were begun at             the European Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility (EISCAT) in                      northern Scandinavia during the summer of 1990, when Dr. Coles                  was on sabbatical.  Despite limits on the observing time, the 1990              data have permitted the first quantitative comparison of theoretical            radial acceleration profiles with measurements.  More time will be              available to them in the coming few summers, which will enable                  them to make many more observations and drastically decrease the                velocity estimation errors.  This extra observing time does require             much more work, and the graduate students as well as several                    European collaborators are necessary for its success.                                                                                                           The basic aim of this proposal is to improve understanding of the               earth's plasma environment.  The plasma is formed by ionization of              the atmosphere by solar radiation.  This \"ionosphere\" interacts with            the outer atmosphere of the sun, the \"solar wind\", in a                         magnetically controlled region called the \"magnetosphere.\"  The                 proposed collaborative research is directed at understanding the                mechanisms which create and accelerate the solar wind, causing the              sudden changes in its velocity which are responsible for ionospheric            disturbances.  Such disturbances have a number of important                     geophysical and practical symptoms, including auroral displays,                 high frequency communications blackouts, fading on satellite                    communication links, and long distance power line upsets.",
