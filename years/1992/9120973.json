Considerable evidence suggests an individual (the                perceiver) who holds preconceived beliefs and expectations about                another person (the target) will act on these beliefs in ways                   that cause the behavior of the target to confirm the perceiver's                initial beliefs.                                                                                                                                                To address the motivational foundations of such behavioral                      confirmation phenomena, a functional analysis is offered.  This                 analysis suggests that interactions sharing the same surface                    features (i.e., perceivers acting in ways that induce targets to                provide actual behavioral confirmation) may be serving different                underlying psychological functions for perceivers and targets.                  Particular attention will be directed to motivational functions                 associated with the acquisition of social knowledge, the                        facilitation of social interaction, the expression of personal                  attributes, and the defense of threatened identities.  A series                 of converging empirical investigations will test hypotheses about               when and why social interaction will culminate either in                        behavioral confirmation or in behavioral disconfirmation.                                                                                                       Theoretical and practical implications of this research program                 will be explored, not only for the nature of behavioral                         confirmation, but also for understanding the dynamic interplay of               cognitive, motivational, and behavioral processes in ongoing                    social interaction and interpersonal relationships.",
