 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new technology of strained superlattice (SSL) of InAsSb and in-             situ formation of photodiode on silicon (Si) has the potential of               fabricating producible long-wavelength infrared (L-WIR) photodiodes             for diverse and military applications.  An investigation on the                 molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of the SSL on Si has been                 made in a phase I SBIR program, aimed at fabricating producible                 LWIR arrays.                                                                                                                                                    This was accomplished in phase I: (1) all required MBE                          modifications compatible to the MBE system have been designed and               some have been reduced to practice; (2) the MBE processes for                   growing a lattice-matching buffer, SSL and photojunction have been              delineated; (3) the feasibility of growing high quality buffer and              InAsSb epitaxial layers on Si has been demonstrated by numerous MBE             growth runs; and (4) a detailed plan for phase II has been                      established.  The MBE growth runs performed have consistently                   produced good epitaxial growth, manifested by well-ordered                      reflective high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) patterns, high              growth stability, mirror-like surface morphology and high carrier               mobility.  These runs have reduced the high risk elements and                   increase the probability of success of phase II.                                                                                                                The first goal in phase II is to optimize the growth of the buffer              and InAsSb SSL to establish a cutoff wavelength of 12 microns.                  Second goal is to develop the photodiode detector using MBE.  A                 special buffer on Si for lattice matching an defect blocking will               be developed then the growth of SSL on the buffer, followed by the              in-situ growth of the photodiodes will be established.  The low-                defect SSL will provide high detector performance, producibility                and uniformity, while the sequential multilayer growth will produce             a straightforward in-situ photodiode formation process.",
