 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to obtain post-disaster measures                on the psychological well-being of residents following hurricane                Andrew.  The investigator has pre-disaster data on 313 South                    Florida students which includes measures of demographics,                       distress, health, performance, cardiovascular and biochemical                   indices, and other moderators such as dispositional optimism,                   personal control, social support, and type of coping.  Post-                    disaster data will now be collected and analyzed using the same                 measures.  Related variables will be grouped together and then                  subjected to multivariate analyses of variance and covariance.                  The analyses will be complemented by moderator variable                         regression analyses aimed at identifying social and personality                 variables that have helped residents cope following Hurricane                   Andrew.                                                                                                                                                         The pre- and post- design that is now possible will allow more                  definitive conclusions to be drawn than the vast majority of                    studies on natural disasters, which have employed retrospective                 measures and static control group designs.  The study should                    overcome several other limitations of past studies in this area.                First, other studies have ignored important theoretical                         distinctions such as the difference between threat and harm                     appraisal.  This project will compare the reactions of students                 who live in areas that sustained major damage from the hurricane                with those of students who were also threatened but did not                     suffer damage.  Second, other studies have done little more than                classify respondents as being victims or not victims of a                       disaster.  In this study, one can see undamaged residences                      standing next to totally destryed homes, and a questionnaire has                been designed to assess actual hardship.  Third, other studies in               this area have employed reactive procedures.  Respondents have                  known that they are being interviewed because they experienced a                major catastrophe.  This will be avoided in this study by                       obtaining data from students as part of the \"standard\" program of               testing that goes on in psychology departments.  It is only after               respondents have answered items on measures of psychological                    distress that they will be asked to complete the Hurricane                      Questionnaire.",
