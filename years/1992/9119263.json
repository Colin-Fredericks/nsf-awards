The principal investigators resolve the cause of                    uplift of the Sierra Nevada and its relation to the adjoining                   Death Valley extensional province and the southern San Joaquin                  basin.  Currently, two end-member models for uplift of the range                have been presented.  These are:  (a) isostatic compensation of a               deep crustal root and (b) upwelling of the asthenosphere                        associated with extension to the east.  These two models have                   fundamentally different consequences for the dynamic behavior of                the continents, particularly in the manner in which crustal                     sections are either (a) underplated by materials from the upper                 mantle or (b) weakened and extruded to fill in extensional voids.               In addition to the uplift and related extension of comparable                   mountain ranges worldwide, examples of globally significant                     features that will be better understood by resolution of the                    Sierran root question include:  factors controlling the manner in               which sialic basement nappes detach; how collision zones collapse               under their own burden; and how intracontinental transform faults               partition strain to and beyond the Moho.",
