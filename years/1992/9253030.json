 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal links action research with three educational                      reform initiatives for this decade; the push for new                            professional roles for teachers, the revitalized reform                         movements in mathematics and science education, and the need                    to reframe the current practices in teaching and assessing                      learning along a more constructivist approach.  Action                          research in schools is usually undertaken by teachers to                        improve their own practices; it can make significant                            contributions to each of these agendas, although it has been                    under-utilized.  This project will develop and disseminate                      the rationale and knowledge of how action research can                          support real change in classroom practices.  It has been                        used extensively in Australia and the United Kingdom to                         bring teachers' professional knowledge to bear on                               educational development and reform initiatives, and in the                      United States for major reforms in the teaching of reading                      and writing.  Despite significant local projects, this                          approach remains largely outside of mainstream science and                      mathematics reform efforts.                                                                                                                                     This project will bring together for one weekend a working                      conference of 35 participants who represent multiple                            perspectives in the fields of math, science, teacher                            development, and research methodology, and who play key                         roles in educational reform: teachers, school                                   administrators, research methodologists, policy makers, and                     teacher educators.  They will define action researcch as it                     applies to American education, identify its enabling                            conditions, and create a vision of its potential to support                     renewal in science and math education.  This project will                       create a strong network of colleagues knowledgeable about                       how action research can faciliate reform; ongoing                               telecommunications among participants as the project is                         developed and as follow-up to new initiatives; a set of                         recommendations for ways that action research can suport                        reforms in science and mathematics education, disseminated                      through professional organizations; a published monograph                       written by conference participants that encompasses current                     theory and practice of action research, which will be                           delivered to 1,000 leaders and made available for purchase;                     and a new methodology for linking small, context-specific                       research by teachers for the purpose of informing larger                        educational decision-making.",
