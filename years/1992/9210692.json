 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to provide a methodology for the                   automatic construction of instruction sets for specialized                      application domains.  Specialized, programmable computers are                   useful in situations where a general purpose computer may be too                slow or expensive for the application. This research augments                   current high-level synthesis tools which derive a computer                      implementation when given an algorithm or instruction set as input.             The proposed technique takes benchmarks and a description of the                computer data path as input and produces as output the instruction              set that best uses the data path to run the benchmarks.  Topics of              research include reducing the dependency of the results on the                  compiler used, determining an adequate number of benchmarks needed              to produce an instruction set well-matched to the application                   domain, and investigating alternative methods of instruction set                derivation.  The proposed tool, when coupled with current high-                 level synthesis systems, can provide a complete design system for               quickly mapping a specialized problem domain into a high                        performance processor.  This allows the realization of computation              accelerators for a broad class of disciplines, including real time              event processing, digital signal processing, and computational                  chemistry, physics, and biology.",
