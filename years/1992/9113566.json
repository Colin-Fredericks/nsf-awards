 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interaction between the earth's atmosphere and the ground is                    primarily confined to a  relatively thin atmospheric layer (about               1 km deep, the planetary boundary layer.  There are observations                available, primarily in the lowest few hundred meters of the                    atmosphere, that depict the distribution of wind, temperature and               humidity that accompany the passage of a front.  Fronts are often               accompanied by severe weather:  there is a need to diagnose the                 physical processes that are associated with fronts, and to                      predict their movement and severity.  Yet there are few if any                  models, that can provide a fundamental conceptual framework upon                which to analyze low-level observations taken during frontal                    passages.                                                                                                                                                       The proposed research is designed to develop a planetary boundary               layer model that may be used for the analysis of meteorological                 variables that accompany the passage of an atmospheric front.                   Available data will be used to evaluate the relative importance                 of different physical processes, and to reduce the model to a                   form that is amenable to analysis.                                                                                                                              Independent data are expected to be available from instrumented                 meteorological tower measurements in the People's Republic of                   China, and from the U.S. National Weather Experiment (STORM)                    observational array in the mid-west (during the winter of 1992).                These data may be used to verify model predictions, and to refine               the model for use as a diagnostic tool in planetary boundary                    studies.  This work is particularly relevant to STORM related                   activities during the 1990's and to work presently being carried                out in the Severe Meso-Scale Laboratory of Nanjing University.",
