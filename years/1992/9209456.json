Noting a formal relationship                                                    between optimal control theory and                                              the derivative propagation                                                      algorithms of recurrent neural                                                  networks, this research will go                                                 further to reveal more design                                                   options offered by optimal control.                                             Thus an optimal control formulation                                             will be used to generalize                                                      derivative propagation in recurrent                                             networks.  The first phase of this                                              research will use a design option                                               that buffers against the effects of                                             noise in trained dynamic pattern                                                recognition systems. The second                                                 phase will incorporate minimum-time                                             optimal control to reduce training                                              time in recurrent systems.  The                                                 third phase will propose fast                                                   schemes for use in mitigating                                                   radical disturbances.  The fourth                                               phase will perform a qualitative                                                analysis for some of the systems                                                resulting from the above schemes.",
