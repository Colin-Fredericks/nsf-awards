To                      characterize fully the significance of a known unbalanced                       populationsex ratio, processes which cause the bias are of                      primary interest, not only in terms of explaining a population                  condition, but elucidating fundamental differences in the                       selective pressures affecting the different sexes.  A series of                 experiments to study mechanisms affecting the sex ratio of the                  dioecious perennial Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae) are                      proposed.  The proposal will address a set of main factors                      potentially responsible for the initiation and  maintenance of a                sex ratio bias: discrepancies between numbers of X- and Y-                      containingpollen in males, death of XY or XX zygotes,                           differentialsurvivorship within the seed bank, and sex specific                 mortality schedules.  The experiments described will provide                    valuable information on when males and females experience                       divergent selection pressures.  This knowledge, in turn, will                   help us address the ecological and evolutionary significance of                 such biases.",
