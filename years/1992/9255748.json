 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a two-day conference on evolution                       education to be held December 3 & 4, 1992 at Louisiana State                    University.  The purposes of the conference include (a) the                     identification of areas of needed research on evolution                         education, and (c) the development of a network of science                      educators who have a keen interest in evolution education.                      The conference will include 10 scientists, 10 science                           educators and 10 high school and middle school biology                          teachers, plus approximately 10 LSU faculty and graduate                        students.  Professional organizations (e.g., AAAS, NSTA,                        NABT, NARST) will be represented at the conference with the                     intention of encouraging further debate on important issues                     related to the learning of concepts important to an                             understanding of the overall framework of evolution.  The                       \"products\" of the conference will include, (a) 500 copies of                    proceedings to be distributed to organizations and                              individuals, (b) video-taped highlights of the conference,                      (c) a network of individuals who will communicate and work                      with conference participants, and (d) a summary of the                          highlights of the conference to be published in a special                       issue of the Journal of Research in Science Teaching devoted                    to evolution education research.",
