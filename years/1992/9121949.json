 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Kenneth Hirth will                continue his archaeological research at the site of Xochicalco                  which is located in Morelos, central Mexico.  Work to date                      indicates that this large prehispanic urban center existed during               both the Classic (250-700 AD) and Epiclassic (700-950 AD)                       periods.  Data also shows that it was a center for the production               of obsidian (volcanic glass) tools.  Because of the sharp cutting               edge it holds, obsidian was widely prized throughout prehistoric                Middle America.  Dr. Hirth will first conduct test excavations                  and then larger scale work to collect samples of obsidian as well               as other cultural materials.  The goal is to determine how this                 industry was organized and how it changed over time.  Artifact                  remains will be collected using a two-stage macro-micro strategy                which samples different dimensions of the artifact universe.                    Macro-debitage (remains), obtained in normal screening                          operations, will be combined with an analysis of micro-debitage                 recovered from fine mesh water screening.  The scale and                        specialization of production will be examined through an analysis               of the lithic technology and types of tools produced.                                                                                                           Large states arose and declined in Central Mexico prior to the                  arrival of the Spanish and many archaeologists are trying to                    understand the processes involved.  In recent years it has become               clear that control over trade and the access to scarce resources                played a major role.  During the Classic period the polity                      centered around Teotihuacan dominated Central Mexico.  After ca                 700 AD, this state declined and power shifted to a number of                    smaller regional centers such as Xochicalo.  Therefore, it is                   quite interesting to examine what changes in the production and                 control of obsidian occurred over this transitional period.  Dr.                Hirth will study not only how Xochicalo related to the larger                   world of Middle America but also how obsidian production was                    organized within the site itself.  Did production tend to be                    egalitarian or was it tightly controlled in state run workshops.                Excavation and analysis of recovered remains will help to address               these questions.                                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data of interest to a large group of archaeologists.  It will                   also increase our understanding of how complex societies emerge                 and are maintained.",
