 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists, biogeographers, and other scientists recently have             devoted considerable attention to the study of factors that                     influence the form and extent of biological diversity within                    various types of locales.  Among the factors that have been studied             intensively are the impacts of various types of natural and human-              induced disturbances (like fires or floods) and the response of                 vegetative and faunal communities to changes in general                         environmental conditions (like changes in temperature or                        precipitation).  Relatively little research has been devoted to                 interactions between these general factors, however.  This project              will focus on description and analysis of vegetation change in the              mixed deciduous forest ecosystems of the Huyck Preserve in upstate              New York.  The project will focus on answering two questions:  (1)              What role does disturbance play in determining the species                      composition and richness of forest and old field communities? and               (2) What responses in understory forest-vegetation phenology and                spatial population dynamics can be related to environmental                     variability within and between years?  These questions will be                  answered using data gathered through a variety of means, including              vegetation censuses and mapping, tree-ring measurements,                        measurement of vegetation gaps, testing of soil samples, and                    experiments in which environmental variables are controlled to                  replicate different climatic regimes.                                                This project will provide new information about and new                    insights into the ways that different forms of disturbance and                  different types of environmental change affect the number, form,                and location of different species in temperate mixed deciduous                  ecosystems.  Because analyses of these two general factors will be              conducted simultaneously, the project will also enhance                         understandings of interactions among disturbances and different                 forms of environmental variability as they affect vegetation.  The              conclusions of this project therefore will contribute to increased              knowledge of the fine-scale dynamics within and between vegetative              communities, and they also will advance the development of more                 comprehensive regional and global models that relate natural change             to human and physical activities.",
