 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one-year award will support collaborative research in                      mysticete whale systematics and conservation between Richard                    Lambertsen of the University of Pennsylvania's Ecosystems, Inc.,                Ulfur Arnason of the University of Lund in Sweden. Stephen                      Palumbi of the University of Hawaii will also participate in the                project.  Lambertsen and Arnason will photoidentify and sample by               biopsy free-ranging humpback whales in the offshore waters                      between Iceland and Greenland.  The tissues will be analyzed for                mitrochondrial DNA variation and sequencing at the University of                Hawaii and the University of Lund.  These data will be correlated               and compared to corresponding estimates of mitochondrial DNA                    nucleotides of other whale species in the Atlantic and Pacific.                                                                                                 The project will extend ongoing investigations into the worldwide               population genetics and evolution of mysticete whales supported                 under NSF grant BSR-900006 with Stephen Palumbi and Richard                     Lambertsen as consultant.  This project is part of the NSF's                    Conservation Biology Initiative.  Results will allow an initial                 assessment of the genetic consequences of commercially exploited                whales, provide a greater understanding of mitochondrial DNA                    variation among whales worldwide and ultimately help promote the                whale conservation. The project will benefit from the                           complementary expertise of Lambertsen in skin biopsy sampling                   and Arnason in DNA analysis and marine mammals.",
