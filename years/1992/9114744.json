 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last three years, our NSF funded program                               let to a number of significant results in the  areas                            of short wavelength laser spectroscopy, laser                                   materials, and laser plasma interaction.  For the                               first time we used inner shell photoionization of                               molecules to generate new, excimer like molecular                               states.  It was demonstrated that the laser produced                            plasma excitation technique can also be used to                                 promote new chemical reactions to form molecular                                ions.  These results will have decisive impact on                               future schemes of molecular short wavelength                                    lasers, plasma chemistry, the spectroscopy of inner                             shell excited molecules, and even the understanding                             of dense molecular clouds in the neighborhood of                                quasars.  Another highlight of our program was the                              investigation of high intensity phenomena in laser-                             materials interaction and the production of sub-100                             nm lines polymers by direct ultraviolet laser                                   ablation.                                                                       The proposed program for the next three years                                   focuses on three new ideas.  The time is now ripe                               to undertake experiments towards photoionization                                pumped ionic excimer lasers.  In this project we will                           bring together the progress on photoionization                                  pumping of atomic short wavelength lasers                                       pioneered by one of the investigators.  The second                              project will focus on investigating the possibility for                         new UV and VUV excimer like solid state lasers.                                 The objective is to combine the efficiency and                                  tunability if excimers with the compactness and                                 relative simplicity of solid state lasers.  Finally, we                         will explore a new idea to produce gain in                                      dissociating molecules in a proposal we call the                                disomer (or disoplex) laser scheme.  Such                                       amplifiers would be universal for all dissociating                              molecular states and would have unsurpassed                                     bandwidth for the amplification of pulses in the 10                             fs range.",
