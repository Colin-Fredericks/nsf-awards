 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research and development project is to                         promote the basic understanding of both the instability                         behavior and the material failure characters of J-stiffened                     composite panels manufactured by newly developed stitching                      and resin film infusion technique.                                                                                                                              In general, analytical solutions cannot be obtained for the large               deflections associated with postbuckled structures. In order to                 predict stiffened panel behavior after initial buckling and the                 ultimate compressive strength of stiffeners, semiemprical                       techniques have to be utilized.                                                                                                                                 Failure of composite stiffened panels due to stiffener/web                      separation is a common mode of failure in the postbuckling range.               It is extremely difficult to predict this failure, even by using                rather sophisticated analysis methods. In addition, due to the                  use of advance composite materials, two types of damage propagation             must be considered: 1)delaminations in laminates under compressive              loading; 2) through-the-thickness cracks in laminate in tension.",
