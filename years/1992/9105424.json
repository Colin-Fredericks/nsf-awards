 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project research will be focused on differential                   equation models studying the effects of spatial heterogeneity and               indirect nutrient consumption on microbial growth.  The model                   equations for two competing species generate a strongly monotone                dynamical system, and steady state coexistence has been shown to                be possible.  Using various techniques in nonlinear analysis and                numerical simulations, the investigator will study the choice of                parameters for coexistence, the effect of microbial mobility on                 coexistence, and the maximum number of coexisting species.                      Research on indirect nutrient consumption will focus on models of               both extracellular and intracellular conversion of the nutrient                 to an intermediate product which is assimilated for growth.  The                goal is to compare the efficiency of the different consumption                  processes, and to study the possibility of coexistence of species               with different mechanisms of nutrient assimilation.                                  This project is concerned with the study of mathematical                   models of microbial growth and competition in continuous culture,               a commonly used laboratory technique in microbiology.                           Microorganisms play very important roles in natural ecological                  systems, and their activities have numerous industrial                          applications, e.g., waste water treatment, production of food,                  drugs and various other chemicals, bacterial control, etc.                      Competition between different species is an important feature in                many ecological systems, and the design of many industrial                      processes, e.g., use of biological agents in bacterial control or               waste disposal, is based on the competitiveness of different                    species.  Experimental study of microbial activities in                         laboratory environments are especially amenable to mathe matical                modeling by differential equations.  Analysis of the model                      equations gives better understanding of the underlying principles               of microbial behaviors, and often leads to new experimental                     designs.",
