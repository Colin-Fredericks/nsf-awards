 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reports of increasing rates of ozone depletion and                              predictions of the resulting increased levels of                                ultraviolet-B radiation at the earth's surface have been                        documented.  Plant scientists have investigated the                             effects of increasing UV-B radiation on crop plants, but                        the responses in native plants in natural ecosystems                            are largely unknown.  Meaningful studies of the effects                         of increasing UV-B radiation on native plants should                            include the stresses associated with their natural                              environments.  Although coastal salt marshes are highly                         productive, the very low plant diversity together with                          high salt concentrations create habitats which are not                          very resilient to disturbances.  The data for crop plants                       indicate wide variation in plant responses, suggesting                          possible selective effects that could be very damaging to                       the delicate balances present in natural communities.                           The purpose of this study id to examine the interactive                         effects of increasing UV-B radiation and salt stress in                         holophytic plants of coastal salt marshes.  Specific                            objectives include investigations of whether increasing                         UV-B radiation results in selective effects on species                          composition and whether these plants, which are normally                        exposed to high light intensities, develop protective                           mechanisms against higher levels of UV-B radiation.",
