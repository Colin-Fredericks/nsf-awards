 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific staff of the University of Missouri                         Research Reactor (MURR) will conduct an NSF REU Program using                   facilities at the University's 10 megawatt research reactor.                    Scientists trained in physics, chemistry and biochemistry will                  supervise students working on projects in such fields as                        neutron optics, neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron                          scattering, analysis of stress in materials, macro-molecular                    structure, radiation defects, nuclear archaeology, geology,                     analytic epidemiology, nutrition and radiopharmaceutical                        chemistry.  The central focus of the proposed program is the                    use of neutrons to interrogate or alter specimens.  The MURR                    is an active and exciting research center for hosing these                      activities.  It is the highest powered university research                      reactor in the U.S. and operates 24 hours/day for 6-1/2 days                    each week.  In addition to the resident reactor staff and                       faculty from MU, the MURR hosts a steady stream of visitors,                    collaborators and students.  Neutron irradiation facilities                     include pneumatic tube, in-pool and flux-trap positions.  In                    addition there are six radial beam lines and a thermal-column                   facility.  The project areas previously mentioned will be                       studied by a variety of nuclear techniques including: neutron                   interferometry, single crystal and powder neutron diffraction,                  triple-axis neutron spectrometry, small angle neutron                           scattering, deep level transient spectroscopy, conventional                     and prompt neutron activation analysis, radionuclidic assay                     and radioisotope production.",
