 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peroxisomes are present in cells of virtually all eukaryotes and             are the subcellular location of many important metabolic reactions.             Little is known regarding basic mechanisms by which cells maintain              and propagate peroxisomes and direct specific sets of newly                     synthesized proteins to these organelles.  This laboratory has                  initiated a molecular genetic investigation of peroxisomes using                the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, as a model system.  P.               pastoris was chosen because peroxisomes are required for its growth             on either methanol or oleate (an easily observed phenotype) and                 because molecular genetic methods are well developed in this                    organism.  By isolating and examining a collection of methanol-                 utilization-defective P. pastoris strains, 23 mutants in 8                      different genes have been identified that are peroxisome-deficient              (per mutants).  These mutants will be subjected to genetic,                     biochemical and cellular biological studies to elucidate their                  primary defects.  Selected mutants will also be used to clone PER               genes by functional complementation.  Information from predicted                amino acid sequences of PER products together with that from                    biochemical analysis of per mutants should yield important insights             into the function of specific PER proteins and into the mechanisms              that operate in peroxisome biogenesis.                                          %%%                                                                             Virtually all eukaryotic cells harbor membrane-bound organelles                 called peroxisomes.  They are the site of hydrogen peroxide-                    generating oxidative reactions in cells.  Peroxisomal matrix                    proteins catalyze several important metabolic pathways; the                     specific pathways vary depending on the organism and/or organ or                tissue.  In plants, peroxisomes are involved in photorespiration                and, during germination of fatty seeds, contain enzymes responsible             for the beta-oxidation of stored fatty acids to acetyl-CoA, which               enters the glyoxylate cycle to form succinate, the metabolic                    building block.  Glyoxylate cycle reactions may even occur in the               peroxisome, in which case the organelle is called a glyoxysome.                 In animals, peroxisomal enzymes play an essential role in several               anabolic and catabolic pathways, particularly in lipid metabolism;              these include synthesis of plasmalogens (ether-linked membrane                  glycerolipids), oxidative degradation of very long chain fatty                  acids, and certain aspects of sterol and bile acid metabolism.  A               group of human genetic disorders, invariably fatal in infancy, are              due to the absence of peroxisomes.  Despite the universal                       importance of peroxisomes for eukaryotic organisms, very little is              known about their biogenesis.  They are not part of the exocytic /              endocytic system of the cell (including lysosomes, endoplasmic                  reticulum, and Golgi apparatus), and they are also distinctly                   different from mitochondria and chloroplasts, which have double                 membrane boundaries and endogenous genomes and protein synthetic                machineries.  The P. pastoris system, developed in this laboratory,             offers the opportunity of approaching the peroxisomal biogenesis                problem from several different angles at once (biochemistry,                    genetics, and cell biology).  This work will shed important new                 light on how peroxisomes are assembled in eukaryotic cells.",
