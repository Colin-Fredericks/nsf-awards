 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemically mediated interactions among marine animals are thought               to regulate many important ecological processes.  The nature of                 chemical signals, their interaction with the aqueous medium, and                the mechanisms of reception by tuned receivers are unknown for                  virtually all marine animals.  Mate recognition is a major                      regulatory point in marine invertebrate reproductive cycles because             it is when males and females make evolutionarily significant                    choices about investing their gametes.  The overall goal of this                project is to investigate how male and female zooplankton                       communicate and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of                 this interaction.  The research will attempt to describe the                    biochemical features of a sex pheromone shown to be responsible for             mate recognition in rotifers.  The research will investigate the                biochemical basis for its species-specificity and how variable the              pheromone is within and between populations.  Ultimately, the                   research will provide insight to how changes in this molecule                   promote reproductive isolation among populations and determine the              direction of evolution.  A system similar to the contact                        chemoreception mate recognition system of rotifers has ben                      described in copepods.  The role of surface glycoproteins in                    copepod chemoreception will be explored using the same lectin                   probes that have proven useful in rotifers.  By comparing rotifer               and copepod mate recognition systems, we may begin to understand                the generality of contact chemoreception in zooplankton mating.",
