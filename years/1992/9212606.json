 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given the rapid changes taking place in scientific computing and                the Federal High-Performance Computing and Communications multi-                agency program, it is important to examine future directions for                the NSF Supercomputer Centers Programs, its organizational                      structure and its role in the overall national effort in high                   performance computing.  The Program Advisory Committee (PAC) of the             Division of Advanced Scientific Computing will convene a workshop               on this subject on March 7-8 1992, to provide NSF with broadly-                 based input from experts in the field, and to prepare position                  papers which will serve as the basis for the report.  Topics for                discussion at this workshop will be:                                                                                                                            1) Access: The major function of the Centers Program is to provide              access to state of the art computational facilities for the                     national research community.  What facilities will be needed in                 the coming years.                                                                                                                                               2) Infrastructure development: What should be role of the Centers               in developing human and computational infrastructure?                                                                                                           3) Catalysis and technology transfer: What should be the role of                the Centers in relation to the high performance computer industry               and the industrial user community?                                                                                                                              4) Process: Are changes needed in the structure of the Centers                  Program?  How should it be reviewed and renewed?  What should be                the relationship between the Centers Program and other high                     performance computing programs supported by the NSF, other federal              agencies and state government?",
