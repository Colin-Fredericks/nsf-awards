 "awd_abstract_narration": "The circulation of the middle atmosphere is driven by complex              interactions of chemical, physical, and dynamical processes.                    Ideally this circulation should be simulated with a fully three                 dimensional model, but to do so can be computationally prohibitive.             For this reason, and also in order to isolate certain processes for             in-depth studies, researchers rely on simpler models for much of                their work.  In designing simpler models, researchers endeavor to               make them as realistic as possible.  Under her last award, the                  principal investigator coupled a quasi-geostrophic time-dependent               wave model to a zonally averaged (two-dimensional) chemical-                    radiative-dynamical model of the middle atmosphere (principally the             stratosphere).  The wave model is used to determine the driving of              the mean flow by Rossby waves and subsequently the eddy transport               of chemical species.  Her goal was to obtain more realistic                     simulations of stratospheric circulation and associated trace                   species transport than would be possible with the two dimensional               model alone.                                                                         With this renewal award, Dr. Smith will continue her research              on the middle atmosphere.  The coupled model will be made more                  realistic with the addition of an interactive lower boundary at the             tropopause.  The principal objective then will be to assess the                 quality of the coupled model's dynamical interactions and the                   ability to simulate transport of chemical species (the distribution             of which also affects the circulation).  The coupled model will be              compared in detail with a fully nonlinear three dimensional model               of the stratosphere to determine the ability of the wave model to               represent transport processes.",
