 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gap junctions are comprised of membrane channels that allow the                 diffusion of small molecules between cells. Studies of gap                      junctional communication in the early mouse embryo have shown                   that cells in the embryo exhibit preferred pathways of exchange                 that effectively subdivides the embryo into discrete domains or                 communication compartments. The spatial organization of these                   compartments correlate with ongoing differentiation and cell                    lineage segregation events. These observations together with the                finding that the inhibition of gap junctional communication can                 lead to developmental perturbations suggest that gap junctions                  may play an important role in mouse embryogenesis. To evaluate                  this possibility, in this study the embryonic stem cell approach                will be used to target the disruption of the endogenous gap                     junction gene encoding Cx43, as Cx 43 transcripts are observed to               be differentially expressed within the context of these                         communication compartment domains. Once such targeted ES cells                  are obtained, they will be used to generate chimeras, from which                embryos and mice that are heterozygous and homozygous for the                   Cx43 null allele will be obtained and analyzed. A detailed                      histological analysis will be carried out to examine if                         development is perturbed. The gap junctional communication                      properties of these embryos will be monitored by ionic and dye                  coupling studies. Of particular interest would be the finding of                perturbations in heart development, and the development of the                  central nervous system, the segmented vertebral column, limb                    morphogenesis, etc., as in situ hybridization studies have shown                that Cx43 is expressed in a striking spatially restricted pattern               in conjunction with development in these regions of the embryo.                 The results of these studies should provide valuable insights                   into the possible role of Cx43 in mouse development.",
