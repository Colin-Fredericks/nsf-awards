 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will involve the synthesis of a number of organic                 molecules that contain carbon-carbon double bonds severely                      twisted out of planarity.  These distortions produce profound                   changes in both the chemical and spectroscopic properties of                    the double bond.  The structure (x-ray crystallography), strain                 energy (computational) and reactivity (kinetics) of these                       strained double bonds will be examined in order to understand                   how mechanical distortions of the olefin linkage are translated                 into chemical reactivity.  The analysis will also include                       distorted amides (quasi-double bonds), the results of which can                 provide insight regarding the mechanism of activation of the                    peptide bond towards hydrolysis by enzymes.  The synthesis of                   new families of molecules containing the double bond in novel                   topologies is also planned.  These species will enable the                      evaluation of the chemical response of the double bond to                       various torsions and out-of-plane bendings, leading to the                      possibility of identifying alkene reaction manifolds that may                   be particularly sensitive to specific molecular distortions.                    The third component of this research utilizes high-energy,                      twisted alkenes as monomers for the synthesis of strained                       polymers.  The reactions employ metathesis catalysts to achieve                 polymerization.  New methodology is described to form these                     novel, high energy materials.                                                   %%%                                                                             With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                 research of Dr. Kenneth J. Shea at the University of                            California, Irvine.  The research explores the influence of                     structural deformation on the reactivity of the carbon-carbon                   double bond and the amide group which may also considered a                     quasi-double bond.  Strained polymers will also be made from                    strained monomers.  This will generate new methodology and                      materials that should benefit research in biochemistry,                         medicine, as well as in the chemical industry.",
