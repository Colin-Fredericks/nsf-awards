 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of eight U.S. scientists in           a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Implications of Contemporary Behavioral                 Research on Language Pragmatics and Derived Stimulus Relations.                 The co-organizers of the seminar, which will be held July 13-18,                1992 in Yamanishi, Japan, are Professors Steven Hayes and Linda                 Hayes, both of the Department of Psychology, University of                      Nevada, and Professor Masaya Sato, Department of Psychology,                    Keio University, Tokyo.  Researchers in both the United States and              Japan have made major contributions to the growing literature on                the impact of these research developments on behavioral                         approaches to the analysis of complex human behavior more                       generally.  This U.S.-Japan seminar will be the first conference to             examine the topic.  Participants will consider the implications of              these new research findings for the analysis of such topics as                  problem solving, reasoning, choice, self-control, lying,                        superstition, and imagining.                                                                                                                                    Japanese psychological scientists have long had a particular interest           in complex human behavior, and they are especially sensitive to the             theoretical implications of these research developments.  There is,             in addition, a great deal of innovative work on artificial language in          primates going on at the Institute of Primate Research at Kyoto                 University.  This work bears on the distinction between human and               animal language of considerable interest to U.S. researchers.                   Conversely, much of the basic behavioral research literature is                 published by researchers in the United States.  By bringing together            notable researchers from both countries, the seminar should                     encourage better coordinated efforts and collaborative research.",
