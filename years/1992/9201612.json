 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the improvement of the accuracy of                       methods to solve two particular eignenvalue problems.                                                                                                           The first is the classical symmetric eigenvalue problem.                        Recent results have shown that there is a large class of                        symmetric eigenvalue problems for which small structured                        perturbations result in small changes in the eigenvalues in                     the relative sense.  This class of matrices is called \"well-                    behaved\".  The problem of finding a neccessary and sufficent                    condition for a matrix to be \"well-behaved\" will be                             investigated.                                                                                                                                                   Another concern is that only a few algorithms have been shown                   to achieve relative accuracy on a subset of the set of \"well-                   behaved\" matrices.  The investigation will try to discover if                   that set of algorithms can be expanded.  The divide and                         conquer approaches of Cuppen, Dongarra, Jessup, Sorensen, and                   Tang are considered.  Good absolute error bounds on these                       algorithms have already been established and it remains to                      show tighter relative error bounds for diagonal dominant                        problems and for the singular value decomposition.                                                                                                              The other large problem area concerns the eigenvector problem                   for non-symmetric matrices.  The problem arises in the                          numerical solution of Markov modeling problems.  Accurate                       general bounds on Gaussian elimination have been proven.                        These allow for the straighforward application of standard                      sparse matrix techniques to this problem.  However, better                      structured perturbation bounds need to be proved for the                        nearly uncoupled case.",
