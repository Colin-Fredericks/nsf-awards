 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study addresses basic ecological processes that influence the              nature and diversity of tree regeneration during secondary forest               succession in low-elevation tropical forest.  It is hypothesized                that seedling recruitment during succession is strongly dependent on            both resource availability and heterogeneity.  Specifically, it is              suggested that changes in canopy and gap structure, as successional             forests age, increase both light availability and light                         heterogeneity at ground level.  It is expected that species richness            of the regeneration pool is enhanced by both overall light                      availability and the diversity of light environments represented in             older, structurally heterogeneous stands.  Seedling recruitment is              further enhanced by availability of patches of disturbed soil                   associated with gaps or animal activity.  This interdisciplinary                approach integrates ecosystem-level studies of the patterns of                  tropical forest succession with detailed analyses of within-stand               processes producing those patterns and studies of physiological and             growth responses of representative species.                                                                                                                     Changes in forest composition and structure with be documented in               the species richness of seedlings, and in within-stand environmental            heterogeneity in a chronosequence of secondary and old-growth                   premontane rain forests of northeastern Costa Rica.  Detailed                   measurements of the spatial variation of light availability, soil               disturbance, and litter cover in selected forests will be performed             along this chronosequence.  The influence of distance to seed                   sources on propagule diversity will be assessed in these stands by              sampling soil seed stocks in the study sites and by comparing the               diversity of seedlings and saplings as a function of distance from              seed sources.  Investigators will experimentally examine the effects            of resource availability and heterogeneity on seedling establishment            and growth by manipulating light availability and soil disturbance              in a series of 15-25 year old stands.  Light will be manipulated by             creating large and small canopy gaps and removing understory shrubs             in a replicated single-factor (4 treatments) design in which we will            assess the effects on natural seedling recruitment and species                  richness.  Additional manipulative studies in gaps and closed-canopy            sites will examine the interactive effects of light and soil                    disturbance on natural seedling recruitment and the germination and             survival of seeds of selected species.                                                                                                                          Experimental and observational field data will be used to model the             effects of stand structure and light availability of seedling                   abundance and diversity using a spatial, mechanistic, simulation                model of forest dynamics.  To evaluate the role of species-specific             differences in canopy light transmission within secondary forest, a             comparative study of canopy structure and light transmission will be            conducted for five abundant canopy tree species in the stands.  The             model will also simulate the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the             diversity of seedling regeneration, based on measured                           ecophysiological and growth responses of selected species.  Model               inputs will be based on field data from representative stands within            the chronosequence.  This modelling effort will integrate measured              organismal responses in the context of stand-level changes in                   resource availability in tropical forests.  Project results will                contribute to basic ecological research on the maintenance of                   biological diversity in moist tropical forests, with direct                     applicability to studies of tropical forest restoration, secondary              forest management, and sustainable tropical forestry.",
