The participants will work closely with the                         workshop personnel to learn the new ideas, techniques, and                      pedagogy required to effectively integrate high-level graphics                  programmable calculators into the first two years of collegiate                 mathematics. Participants will take home course supplementary                   materials in all five focus areas, will be allowed to borrow                    for a two-week period during the academic year a set of HP-48SX                 calculators for classroom use, and will be offered a deep-                      discount price to purchase an HP-48SX to help them begin to                     incorporate the substance of the workshop on their own                          campuses.",
