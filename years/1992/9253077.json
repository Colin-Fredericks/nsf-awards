Over 80% of the teachers have only a two year                     degree and very few of the rest have four year degrees and                      certification. The aim of the project is to identify the                        primary academic and pedagogical needs of teachers who are                      not certified, to provide initial assistance through the                        National Faculty scholars in meeting those needs, and to                        develop a plan for a multi-year program to address the needs                    of American Samoa teachers in mathematics. The planning                         project will bring together in a collaborative effort                           American Samoa teachers, administrators, Territorial                            education officers, government officials, and National                          Faculty scholars and staff.                                                                                                                                     The National Faculty will share the costs of the project by                     covering over 20% of the expenses.  The total funding awarded                   is $49,900.00",
