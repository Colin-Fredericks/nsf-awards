 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will include a twelve month long-term visit by Dr.                   William N. Beckon of the Division of Environmental Studies at the               University of California, Davis, to Japan for a cooperative                     research project with Professors Makoto Tsuchiya and Hidetoshi                  Ota of the Department of Biology at the University of the Ryukyus               in Okinawa.  Dr. Beckon will be obtaining scientific data to                    determine the number of species that can inhabit any given area                 of islands or habitat.  He has recently completed a database of                 unprecedented scope on the distribution of land birds in the Fiji               Archipelago and on larger land masses around the world.  He will                expand his survey to the Japanese Ryukyu Islands.  This data                    combined with the Fiji Island data will provide the broad base                  needed for a comprehensive theory of species-area relations.  It                is expected that the research will be among the most important                  long-term studies in island biogeography                                                                                                                        Results of the research on species-area relations are important                 to community ecology and may prove valuable in framing of policy                guidelines for conserving biological diversity.  Professor                      Tsuchiya specializes in marine and island ecology and Professor                 Ota has traveled widely around the Ryukyu Islands undertaking                   reptile studies.  Both of these researchers are anxious to                      cooperate in the island biogeographical project.  Dr. Beckon is                 an excellent field naturalist-ornithologist with impressive field               experience.  He is considered the primary American authority on                 the vertebrate fauna of the Fiji Islands.  This collaboration                   should provide important scientific results.  It is likely that                 these researchers will continue their research exchanges even                   after the award has terminated.",
