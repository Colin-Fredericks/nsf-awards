 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michigan State University will conduct a four-year study of                     teachers' learning from mathematics education reform efforts                    in California.  The study will focus on four reform                             elements: tests, texts, professional development and the                        California Mathematics Framework.   The professional                            development models to be studied are six exemplary NSF-                         funded Teacher Enhancement projects.  The study will attempt                    to answer such questions as how teachers change and learn in                    response to current reform movements, what influences their                     learning, and how do teachers' personal and professional                        biographies affect what they learn.  In all 102 elementary                      school teachers will be studied, thirty intensively and 72                      less intensively.  In addition, a mail/telephone survey will                    be conducted with 800 California elementary teachers to                         investigate more broadly the influences of policy on teacher                    thinking and practice, to gather information on the                             understandings, ideas and practices of a larger group of                        elementary teachers, and to contribute to the development of                    indicators useful to studying change.  The survey will also                     allow the PIs to place the teachers whom they had observe in                    depth in the context of a representative sample of                              California teachers.  From the study, case studies and                          evaluation instruments will be developed which will                             contribute to innovations in teacher education, teacher                         change, and reform.                                                                                                                                             In studying the change process, this project has great                          potential for stimulating the construction, investigation,                      documentation and refinement of effective approaches for                        teacher enhancement.
