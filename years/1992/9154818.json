 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multi-year proposal has a comprehensive scope.  Its                        initial charge is to form a National Research Council (NRC),                    Coordinating Council for Education (CCE).  The CCE will                         consist of a seventeen member leadership group charged with                     mobilizing the human and intellectual resources of the                          National Academy of Sciences to accelerate pursuit of national                  educational goals.  The CCE would coordinate the several major                  educational efforts of the Academy, facilitating change in                      science and mathematics education from kindergarten through                     graduate education.                                                                                                                                             The CCE would extend the linking of the national networks in                    mathematics and science education already developed by the                      MSEB and the NSRC over the past five years.  four major                         national initiatives in K-16 science and mathematics education                  will be undertaken.  Other initiatives will be planned during                   this same period.  The identified initiatives are (1) the                       development of a national committee on K-12 science standards                   and assessment; (2) initiate improvement in undergraduate                       science and mathematics education; (3) building a national                      consensus among science and mathematics educators; (4) to                       monitor progress nationally and internationally; (5)                            networking teacher nationwide; (6) closing the                                  intramural/extramural technology gap; (7) undertake middle                      school mathematics and science reform projects; and (8)                         develop a national demonstration project.",
