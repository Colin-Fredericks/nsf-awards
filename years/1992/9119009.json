 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photogrammetry, remote sensing, and geographical information               systems have become increasingly important in the conduct of                    research in recent decades.  The quadrennial congresses of the                  International Society for Photogrammetry and remote Sensing have                traditionally served as venues for the presentation of the latest               research on and with these methodologies.  This international                   gathering of scholars permits scientists and practitioners the                  opportunity to see, hear, and discuss the most recent                           advancements in research employing photogrammertric techniques,                 data from remote sensing satellites, and geographical information               systems.  The 17th Congress of the ISPRS will be held in                        Washington, D.C. in August of 1992, and it will provide American                scientists with the opportunity to meet and converse with other                 scientists from throughout the world on matters of mutual                       scientific interest.  This award provides support for the                       congress by assisting in the distribution and publication of                    proceedings which will be distributed widely, and by providing a                vehicle for other federal agencies to support the congress                      through interagency funds transfers as supplements to the award.                     By providing a partial subsidy for the congress, the costs                 of disseminating the congress's proceedings will be reduced.                    This will make the proceedings more widely available.                           Additionally, NSF will be in a position to further assist the                   congress through its ability to supplement the award with funds                 provided by other federal agencies.",
