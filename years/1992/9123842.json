 "awd_abstract_narration": "Late Pleistocene raised reef terraces on the island of                     Barbados provide an unparalleled setting to investigate early,                  near-surface diagenesis in carbonate rocks.  Dolomite has been                  encountered in core samples from within the modern mixing zone in               southeastern Barbados.  This dolomite may be Recent in age and                  related to the modern water chemistry.  We well further investigate             this dolomite occurrence with additional core-drilling, lithologic,             geochemical, and hydrogeochemical studies.  Four boreholes will be              drilled atop sea-cliffs along the windward southeastern coastline,              in an area where there is significant meteoric phreatic discharge               and a potentially thick mixing zone.  Southeastern Barbados                     provides the ideal site to test the mixing versus marine models and             to directly sample fresh, mixed, and normal marine pore waters in               contact with carbonate sediments and rocks actively undergoing                  diagenesis.  The mixing zone model has not received universal                   acceptance.  It is therefore important to document the occurrence               and geochemistry of the dolomite and pore fluids in question to                 test the validity of the model.  This will be accomplished through              minerologic, petrographic, trace element, stable isotope, strontium             isotope, fluid inclusion, and absolute dating techniques.  In                   collaboration with R. K. Stoessell, pore waters from the boreholes              will be characterized by temperature, salinity, conductivity, pH,               Eh, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, dissolved hydrogen sulfide, major             and minor elements and ions, saturation indices and stable isotopic             compositions.  Given the geologic/hydrologic setting of Barbados,               the fluid/rock interactions responsible for dolomitization must                 necessarily be confined to either a normal seawater or mixed                    meteoric/marine model.  This integrated petrologic and                          hydrogeochemical approach represents a comprehensive effort to                  answer important questions regarding the enigmatic process of early             dolomitization, and will directly test the viability of each of                 these possible models.",
