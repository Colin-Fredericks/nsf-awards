 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop techniques for                 searching for and sharing software using wide-area networks.  This              will enable software reuse to go beyond libraries; a program written            for a single project may not be used directly, but instead be used as           a template for similar programs in other projects.                                   The principal investigator is conducting new research into                 indexing and querying software databases.  Indexing information must            be generated automatically, with no extra effort by the program                 creator.  Initially he is augmenting an existing CASE tool to generate          such indexing information.  Later research will integrate other                 mechanisms for categorizing software.  Another part of the project is           to develop a distributed query mechanism for widely distributed,                autonomous, software databases.  This will incorporate features such            as automatically canceling queries which generate too many results.             An interface which helps user specify and refine queries is being               designed.                                                                            Although the focus of this work is on sharing computer software,           the techniques developed could prove useful in sharing other                    information, such as data from scientific experiments or limited                interest (and therefore unpublished) studies.",
