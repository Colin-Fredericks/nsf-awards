Large individual-level samples of the U.S. census of population                 covering the census years 1880, 1900, 1910, 1940, 1950, 1960,                   1970, 1980, and 1990 are currently available or in preparation.                 These data have proven to be a valuable resource, since they                    allow researchers to make analyses tailored to their specific                   research questions and to avoid the problems and limitations                    associated with using the published census data for different                   years.  The availability of these census files has led to some                  research on the nature of long-term social change in the United                 States.  However, because the data files were created at                        different times and by different investigators, they have                       incompatible documentation and a wide variety of record layouts                 and coding schemes.  These differences inhibit the use of the                   data for the study of social change.                                                 The preparation and documentation of an integrated Public                  Use Microdata Series will provide a valuable data resource for                  the research community, and will eventually contribute greatly to               our understanding of the changes American society has undergone                 since 1880.",
