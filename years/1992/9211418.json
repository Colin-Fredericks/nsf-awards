 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers in a scientific community or organizational members               in a company are often overwhelmed by the amount of current                     information, the subject and computer knowledge required to access              this information, and the constant influx of even larger amounts                of new information.  Using an electronic community system as a                  testbed the aim of the research is to address specifically the                  information sharing, retrieval, and filtering problems through the              use of a variety of AI and statistical techniques, including                    knowledge acquisition, automatic thesaurus generation, and neural               network computing.  A Concept Space is designed to represent high-              level community knowledge such as topics, subjects, techniques, and             people in terms of nodes and their weighted relationships in a                  structure that is akin to a semantic network.  This Concept Space               can be perceived as a high-level conceptual description of the                  basic information items that reside in an Information Space.  It                is created mainly from a knowledge acquisition process involving                subject experts and from an automatic cluster analysis of documents             stored in the community's online, textual databases.  Two kinds of              system interface are considered both making extensive use of the                Concept Space.  A browsing interface permits users to traverse this             weighted concept network themselves, select concepts of interests,              and access its underlying information.  An activation interface                 based on a Hopfield network spreading activation algorithm                      traverses the network automatically and identify concepts most                  relevant to searchers' needs, with very little searcher                         intervention.  Both types of interface are designed to provide                  user-friendly access, to facilitate learning, and to avoid the need             for extensive user computing knowledge.  This research is designed              to provide insights for the development of more timely,                         comprehensive, and accessible electronic community systems and                  computer-based organizational memory.",
