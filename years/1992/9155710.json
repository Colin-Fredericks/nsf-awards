 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to create the Geometry Forum, which will                        consist of the following three elements:                                                                                                                             o    an electronic database containing a great deal of                     useful information on geometry in all its aspects -- its                        teaching, modern research questions, information on                             mathematics education projects, records of student                              interactions and questions;                                                                                                                                          o    a community consisting of the many satisfied users                    of the database (often conducting their own private                             electronic mail correspondence on the side): high school and                    college students, high school and college teachers, pure and                    applied research geometers, developers of materials and                         researchers into geometry education;                                                                                                                                 o    especially user-friendly software for creating,                       maintaining, and accessing the electronic database, which                       allows sophisticated techniques for browsing and searching,                     uses symbols and diagrams, and implements hypertext                             features.                                                                                                                                                            In effect, we will be creating a dynamic geometry                          journal, together with a large and diverse group of                             readers/contributors.  Users will have their own                                personalized electronic journal, with immediate access to                       all previous material, and easy means of making their own                       contributions.                                                                                                                                                       Our Forum will contribute both to new                                      telecommunications technology, and to education.  We will                       expand the possibilities for student learning via                               telecommunications, and also increase the geometry resources                    available to teachers (including such personal resources as                     support groups).  Our Forum should also make it possible for                    the geometry research community to become meaningfully                          involved with the education of school students.",
