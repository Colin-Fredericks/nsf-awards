 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is under the Long and Medium-Term Research at                        Foreign Centers of Excellence Program, which enables U.S.                       scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve months of                   research abroad at research centers of proven excellence.  The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit              by Dr. Cornelia W. Fales to the Institut de Recherche et                        Coordination to work with Dr. Stephen McAdams.  The purpose of                  this study is to explore the relationship of noise and inharmonicity            as timbral components.  By noise in this context, Dr. Fales means               the presence of random frequencies at sufficient energy to make a               perceptual difference in the timbral quality of the tone they                   surround.  Specifically, the project will have two parts, both of               which will test the ability of noise to disguise inharmonic partials            of a complex tone.  A third study is included to be undertaken if               time and resources allow, which tests the potential of noise to                 induce perceptions desired by a performer.                                                                                                                      Auditory processing has been described as occurring in two                      directions at once:  from the bottom up, which is called primitive              processing, and from the top down, which is called schema-based                 processing.  If the  cognitive heuristics which regulate primitive              processing of sound are truly innate then it is in the activity of              schema-based processing that evidence may be found for the                      variety of the world's music and musical behavior.  It is here that             we may find evidence in support of the contention that timbral                  sensitivity varies with a listener's use of timbre - in music or in             speech.  The acoustic circumstances under which a tone will fuse                with the noisy components that are part of, or close to its source,             the point at which a tone immersed in noise becomes only a series               of frequencies contributing to the noise and tone - these are                   questions which bear on the subject of instrumental timbre.  These              questions are equally valid for the study of instrumental music in              western culture. The line between noise and tone is often                       contextually established:  is the high-frequency hum of the dentist's           drill noise or tone?  are instrumental ideophones noisy or tonal?               As studies of the continuity illusion have shown, the very                      perception of noise is often dependent on its acoustic context;                 listeners have demonstrated the ability to hear unbroken speech and             nonspeech sounds right through an interfering gap of noise which                does indeed break the sequence of sounds that surround it.  While               psychoacousticians have developed precise definitions to distinguish            noise from tone, the perceiver's categories are less clearly defined.           The results of this project will bear on all these issues.",
