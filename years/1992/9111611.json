 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the collaboration between a group of                 U.S. scientists at Clarkson University and a group of Russian                   scientists from University of Leningrad.  The research concerns the             study of nonlinear partial differential equations by the Inverse                Scattering Transform (IST) Method.  The IST method has been a                   successful and powerful method of solution in the 1+1 (one space                and one time dimension) setting.  The power of the IST method comes             from the fact that the solution of certain nonlinear partial                    differential equations can be reduced to the solution of the                    inverse problem for linear ordinary differential equations, and                 such an inverse problem can usually be formulated as a Riemann-                 Hilbert problem.  As a result, the solution of certain nonlinear                partial differential equations have been obtained simply by using               the methods to solve linear differential equations.  The                        generalization of the IST method to N+1, where N is greater than 1,             has not been as successful and so far some results have only been               obtained for N=2.  The Russian team at Leningrad is noted as one of             the top teams in the world in this area of science.  A                          collaboration would have significant scientific advantage to U.S.               scientists.                                                                          The science supported in this US-USSR collaboration is in the              general area of partial differential equations.  This research                  topic concerns the equations of motion, fluid flow, physics, etc.               that model our physical universe.",
