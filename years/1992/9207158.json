Using Anchorage, Alaska, as a case                                              study, this proposal examines how                                               the reconstruction process has                                                  impacted and continues to impact                                                development of urban form and,                                                  thereby, the configuration of                                                   future risk and vulnerability                                                   levels.

Anchorage, Alaska,                                               is used as a case study because it                                              lends itself to a time series                                                   analysis of development patterns                                                which emerged from post-earthquake                                              reconstruction after 1964.",
