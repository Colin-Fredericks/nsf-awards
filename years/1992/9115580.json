 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Campins will continue an ongoing study of Earth-approaching                 comets.  This study involves an observational approach pioneered                very successfully by Dr. Campins in the study of Comets Neujmin 1,              Arend-Regaux, and Tempel 2.  This approach employs simultaneous                 visible and infrared wavelength observations of comets that pass                within 1.5 Astronomical Units of Earth.  The observations will                  yield the size, albedo, color, rotational characteristics and                   approximate shape of the nuclei of several comets chosen for study.             The results obtained from the previous study of three comets, and               the results from Comet Halley, have provided tantalizing insights               into the nature of cometary nuclei; however, the sample of properly             observed comets consists of only four objects.  The goal of this                project is to double this number over the next three years.                     Knowledge of the nuclear properties for a statistically meaningful              sample of comets will allow general conclusions to be drawn about               the processes that determine these properties, and about the                    relationship between  comets and other minor bodies in the Solar                System, such as Earth-approaching asteroids, and meteorites.",
