 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop the probabilistic analysis of                 several problems of Euclidean combinatorial optimization while                  principally focusing on concrete questions involving minimal cost               paths, minimum spanning trees, Steiner trees, and minimal cost                  matchings.  One critical line of investigation concerns the                     possibility of a central limit theorem for subadditive Euclidean                functionals, especially for the length of the minimal spanning                  tree of a random sample.  Connections between this problem and                  the theory of continuum percolation are strong, and progress in                 either of these two areas can be expected to have useful impact                 on the other.  The overall significance of the project comes in                 part from the fact that probabilistic methods in the theory of                  algorithms have already led to a number of well acknowledged                    computational breakthroughs, and additionally, from the                         observation that computational problems have many sustained                     interactions with topics that are central to probability theory,                like the theory of martingale inequalities, Gaussian processes,                 and empirical processes.                                                             This project aims to develop the applications of                           probabilistic methods to problems that are of concern to computer               scientists, operations researchers, and others who engage                       questions of optimization of discrete systems.  The particular                  feature of the problems of main interest to the proposal is that                of a close connection between geometry, optimization, and natural               probability models for random sets of points in Euclidean space.",
