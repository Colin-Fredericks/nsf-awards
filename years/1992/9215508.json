 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the analysis and interpretation of                airborne Doppler radar and in-situ (i.e., flight level) data from               warm pool mesoscale convective systems (MCS) and on the                         documentation of the three-dimensional airflow within these                     systems.  Past observational field programs (e.g. GATE, PRE-STORM)              have clearly shown that MCSs are a fundamental phenomenon in the                atmosphere.  Particular emphasis will be given to the diagnosis of              vertical motions:  convective-scale in the active cumulus regions               of the MCS and mesoscale in the stratiform rain regions.  The                   accurate quantification of vertical motions is important for the                computation of fluxes of momentum and vertical profiles of heating.                                                                                                  The results from analysis of both Dopple and in-situ data will             be tested, supplemented and extended by using a series of numerical             simulations from several numerical models including both the Clark              and the Klemp-Wilhelmson.  Initialization for these models will be              provided by a combination of data from aircraft and sounding                    observations.  This approach, combining data analysis and numerical             modeling, should lead to a better understanding of MCS structure,               airflow, fluxes, and life-cycle and of the interactions between the             MCS and the environment.                                                                                                                                             This proposal is also concerned with proper planning and                   execution of the aircraft flights, as well as data validation and               data management activities following the completion of the field                phase of TOGA/COARE.  Experience in other field projects (e.g.,                 PRE-STORM hurricanes, TAMEX, and EMEX) has shown the value of real-             time decision making in the selection of proper flight tracks to                fully utilize the capabilites of the airborne Doppler radar.                    Therefore, the scientists performing this research will also                    participate in the field program as airborne Chief Scientists and               Doppler radar operators.  All aircraft scientists are working                   together to meet their individual research objectives through a                 coordinated research flight plan.                                                                                                                                    This research is important because it serves as one of the                 principal TOGA/COARE studies of the processes responsible for                   convection in the western Pacific warm pool and its interaction on              larger scales is an especially climate sensitive region of the                  world, the western Pacific Ocean, the field site of TOGA/COARE.",
