 "awd_abstract_narration": "Packed bed multitube reactors are used in chemical processes                    such as partial oxidation, chlorination, hydrogenation and                      dehydrogenation.  The multitube arrangement facilitates heat                    exchange, to improve process selectivity and stability by                       reducing temperature variations in the catalyst beds.                                                                                                           The PI is planning to design packed-tube reactors using a                       data-                                                                           based transport function.  The function will be constructed                     from measurements of temperature responses to localized wall                    and                                                                             particle heating under laminar and turbulent flow conditions.                                                                                                   Packed-bed reactors will be simulated numerically by combining                  the transport function with the local kinetics of the given                     process.  The experiments and correlation studies will be                       continued to                                                                    establish the transport function to practical accuracy for                      several geometries.  Numerical methods and software for the                     approach will be developed for high-performance parallel                        computers and will be tested on chemical process examples.                      The research will provide a database for computer-aided                         engineering of packed-tube catalytic processes.  The approach                   also has potential applications to other kinds of reactors and                  separation systems.",
