 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cassegrain infrared array camera currently in use on the                    Palomar 200-inch telescope is to be upgraded by purchasing and                  installing a new, state-of-the-art, infrared array.                                                                                                             The current camera has been in service as a major instrument of the             200-inch telescope since 1988, and has been used approximately 90               nights/year during that time on a variety of scientific topics.                 The existing camera array is, however, becoming obsolete in                     comparison with arrays now commercially available.  For this reason             the camera is to be fitted with a new InSb detector array.                                                                                                      The new array can be incorporated into the existing camera with a               small amount of physical modification to the existing camera, new               read-out electronics, and new software to read the array.  The vast             majority of the investment in hardware and software that has gone               into the current infrared camera system will be usable with the                 modified camera.                                                                                                                                                The new infrared sensor will increase the number of picture                     elements (pixels) by more than a factor of 16, will increase the                solid angle of the camera by a factor of 3, and will improve the                noise performance of each pixel by a factor of 7.  Th gains in the              scientific return from the Palomar camera will come in the                      following areas:  increased field of view, increased sensitivity,               improved cosmetics, and increased sampling of images and spectra.               With these gains the science return from the camera, in studies                 ranging from searches for protogalaxies to diffraction limited                  imaging of stars in the process of forming will be vastly                       increased.  The upgrading of the camera will enable entire new                  classes of problems to be undertaken, and will preserve the 200                 inch telescope as a premier facility for research in infrared                   astronomy.",
