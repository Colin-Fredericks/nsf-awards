The research of Grasmick                and Bursik is embedded in a new line of inquiry that emphasizes                 the role of extra-legal factors in controlling anti-social                      behavior.  Theoretically, the study will contribute to deterrence               research by linking the moral dimension of controlling anti-social              behavior emphasized in sociology with the utilitarian paradigm of               rational actors, a notion drawn from the expected utility models                associated with economics.  Their approach will expand the                      utilitarian paradigm by incorporating personal moral beliefs and                community standards in the calculation of expected costs that                   rational actors weigh in assessing the utility of anti-social                   behavior.                                                                                                                                                       Specifically, their proposal will make use of a cross-sectional                 survey conducted in 1982 in Oklahoma City that is to be replicated              in 1992.  The survey is designed to measure relationships between               perceived certainties and severities of shame, embarrassment and                legal sanctions, and self-reports of littering, tax cheating, drunk             driving, assault, illegal gambling, and petty theft.  During the                ten years since 1982, offense-specific legislation, social movement             activity, and appeals to conscience have occured at the national                and local levels, and are expected to have changed the levels of                perceived threats in the community.  The merged dataset will be the             basis for testing hypotheses that changes in the perceived threats              of shame and embarrassment might be more powerful explanations of               changes in offense prevalence than is change in perceived threat                of legal sanctions.",
