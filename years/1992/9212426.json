 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells in the brain communicate with one another by releasing                    chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, which activate                   specific receptors on the next cell.  Understanding the brain thus              requires a knowledge of the identity and function of these                      neurotransmitters.  Yet, despite thirty years of research on the                mammalian visual pathway, the neurotransmitters used by the cells               remain largely unknown.  Receptors for the excitatory amino acids               are involved in this neurotransmission, but evidence suggests that              neither of the obvious candidates, aspartate or glutamate is the                neurotransmitter.  N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) is an                       endogenous brain peptide that acts at an excitatory amino acid                  receptor.  Evidence is mounting that NAAG may be a neurotransmitter             for retinal ganglion cells.  Dr. Tieman's experiments are directed              at this question.  The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is one of               the areas of the brain that receives input from the eye.  Dr.                   Tieman will examine the responses of LGN neurons to stimulation of              the input from the eye and to direct application of NAAG.  If NAAG              is the neurotransmitter, then these responses should be the same.               Immunocytochemistry is a technique that uses antibodies to localize             specific chemical compounds in brain.  Dr. Tieman will use this                 technique for NAAG combined with a variety of other techniques,                 such as electron microscopy, to better characterize both the cells              that contain NAAG and NAAG's distribution within these neurons.                 For example, if NAAG is the neurotransmitter for retinal ganglion               cells, then it should be localized at the synapse, which is part                of the cell that is specialized for communicating with the next                 cell.  Results obtained from these experiments should help to                   clarify NAAG's role in the visual system and provide a better                   understanding of intercellular communication in the brain.***//",
