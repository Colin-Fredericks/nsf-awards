 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybridization has been of major importance for plant evolution.                 Recent research has shown that hybrid plant resistance to                       herbivores may differ from resistance of pure parental plants to                herbivores.  Hybrids could be more, less, equally, or                           intermediately resistant compared to parental species.  Determining             if one of these patterns is prevalent could contribute to                       understanding important ecological and evolutionary aspects of                  plant-herbivore interactions, as well as the role of hybrids in                 considering issues of biological diversity.  This project focuses               on willow species and their hybrids that co-occur in the same                   habitat.  The two parent willow species have different chemical                 systems in their leaves that can be studied in the hybrids and                  parents.  The PI has developed molecular genetic markers to                     characterize naturally occurring and crossed hybrids and parental               species.  The PI will analyze the relationships between                         hybridization, chemical variation and herbivore resistance for                  field plants, and cloned and seedling plants in a common garden.                He will test if differences in chemical expression are correlated               with herbivore resistance of hybrids, and will use molecular                    markers to determine the frequency of hybridization in several                  communities that have both willow species.",
