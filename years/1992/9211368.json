 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 20 years, sex differences in the central nervous                  system have moved from being a subject of speculation to being a                focus of intense research and widespread interest.  This is because             the study of sex differences enhances our understanding of the                  nervous system in at least two different ways.  First, detailed                 examination of sex differences in a neural circuit of a known                   behavioral or physiological function may provide insights regarding             those aspects of the neural circuit that are critically involved                in the display of the function under question.  Secondly, sexual                differentiation is a fundamental process of development.  Thus,                 knowledge of the mechanisms underlying sex differences may lead to              deeper insights into the general processes involved in                          differentiation specialization of nerve cells and their pattern of              connectivity.  Dr. Newton has identified a neuromuscular system                 that can be used as model to examine questions that may lead to a               better understanding of both function and development.  The                     cremaster nucleus is a group of motoneurons located in the ventral              gray horn of the lumbar spinal cord that project through only one               nerve to innervate only one muscle.  This nucleus is sexually                   dimorphic and controls exclusively masculine functions related to               testicular physiology.  Using state-of-the-art anatomical                       methodology, Dr. Newton will tease apart the hormonally and non-                hormonally mediated events in the development of this system.  He               will examine how these cremaster motoneurons normally develop and               then determine how they are altered by changing the size of the                 muscle that they innervate and/or by changing the hormonal milieu.              The results will provide new insights into how spinal cord neurons              respond when their environment is altered.  Besides leading to                  significant advances in concepts regarding developmental                        interactions between motoneurons, their afferents, their target                 muscles and control by gonadal hormones, these studies may provide              information on which hormonal conditions are best for neuron                    survival when the muscles which neurons innervate are damaged or                if the spinal cord itself is damaged.",
