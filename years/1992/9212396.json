 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical studies will be conducted on the dynamics of complex                nonequilibrium systems with many degrees of freedom focusing on                 systems which exhibit nontrivial scaling properties.  A central                 aspect of this work involves a general formulation consisting of                singular diffusion limits.  Issues to be addressed include                      universality, deterministic versus stochastic dynamics, field                   theoretic techniques, the role of conservation laws, origins of the             separation of time scales, and the breakdown of hydrodynamics in                certain systems.  Specific applications of these concepts will be               applied to problems in seismology, fracture, friction and solid                 state physics.                                                                  %%%                                                                             Research will be conducted on both general concepts and specific                applications of self-organized criticality.  This is a theory for               such common events as avalanches of sandpiles which may have a                  profound impact on fundamental physics and nonlinear science, and               yet may have wide-spread application to a variety of real problems              including earthquakes, friction and fracture.",
