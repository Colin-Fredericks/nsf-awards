 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the development of various                       cognitive abilities in preterm and full-term infants with                       uncomplicated medical histories.  It will study the ability of                  these infants to regulate their attention and determine how this                relates to their performance in recognizing previously seen                     objects.                                                                                                                                                        The particular cognitive abilities to be studied include the                    infants recognizing objects, recognizing the locations in which                 objects are placed, remembering these objects and places over                   short intervals, and learning to inhibit certain aspects of their               own behavior when such control is required in order to succeed.                 These abilities have been carefully studied in full-term infants                in the past, and the exact brain regions essential for normal                   performance have also been identified.  For example, it is known                that object and place recognition abilities depend in some way                  upon the temporal and parietal lobes of the brain.  Working-                    memory and inhibitory-control abilities, on the other hand,                     depend upon a specific part of the frontal lobe known as the                    dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  There is relatively precise                    information about exactly when in early development these brain                 regions become fully mature.  Thus, by studying these cognitive                 abilities it may be possible to determine whether the brain                     regions essential to their performance are developing normally in               preterm infants.                                                                                                                                                The working hypothesis is that preterm infants with uncomplicated               medical histories will display selective rather than general                    cognitive defects during development and that these defects might               be related to aberrant attentional patterns.  Given that the                    brain regions underlying each of the tasks to be used is known,                 selective defects on some of the tasks would help identify                      exactly which brain regions are most likely to be compromised by                premature birth, even when there are minimal medical                            complications.  Such results would stimulate further research                   concerning the interaction of early experiences (such as                        prematurity) and cognitive development, and would have important                implications for the creation of effective early intervention                   programs aimed at ameliorating any negative effects of premature                birth.",
