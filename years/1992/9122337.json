 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research grant, funded by the Divisions of Materials Research              and Chemistry, is aimed at providing a description of polymer                   solutions and blends which has a solid basis in statistical                     mechanics, yet is accessible to experimentalists for understanding              current results and designing future work.  The research involves               developing a theoretical description of these systems using                     integral equation techniques where the goal is to understand                    equilibrium properties, especially those concerned with                         miscibility.  Progress has already been made using a lattice model              to describe a binary incompressible mixture and a compressible pure             fluid.  New research will be done in two areas: further development             of the lattice model and extension of this treatment to a continuum             model. The lattice model, which can be solved analytically, can be              checked against simulation results, almost all of which are done on             lattice solutions.  The continuum model is closer to reality, but               analytic solutions are not possible.                                            %%%                                                                             Calculations will be done to describe the properties of liquid                  polymers and their mixtures.  The models will be based on                       statistical mechanics results for liquids and complement other                  models describing these material systems.  The results will be                  important in interpreting experimental results and for designing                new materials.",
