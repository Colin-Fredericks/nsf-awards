 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant investigates how ordinary citizens act against and/or                in accord with totalitarian states imposing societal control                    through the use of terror.  Specifically, the project focuses on                the role that ordinary German citizens played in struggling against             and complying with the system of terror that operated in Nazi                   Germany.  It is based on rigorous quantitative and qualitative                  examination of thousands of previously unexamined arrest and court              records in three German cities.  Analysis of these data enables                 differentiation between which types of people supported Nazism and              which did not.  Further, it will allow for empirical analysis of                whether and how the Gestapo-led system of terror was dependent on               ordinary citizens for its success in stamping out potential                     collective resistence to the Nazi regime.                                                                                                                       In addition to filling in an important empirical gap on how                     ordinary citizens responded to and interacted with this system of               terror, it provides a general model for investigating the                       politicization of crime and the judiciary as an instrument of                   social control.  Also, this model will have wide relevance to                   scholars interested in totalitarian societies, their maintenance,               and their breakdown as an internal dynamic.",
