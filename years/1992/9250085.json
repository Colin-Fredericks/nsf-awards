The selected students will participate in hands-on science                      activities involving chemical analysis and measurements,                        environmental chemistry, polymer science, lasers, holography, and               investigations of the properties of light.  Activities have been                selected that are both exciting and educational.  Participants will             be divided into small groups to conduct a short research project.               A portion of the three-week workshop will involve career awareness              activities such as question and answer sessions with visiting                   scientists and engineers and field trips.                                                                                                                       The nine monthly follow-up activities will involve hands-on science             activities, dynamic speakers, field trips, and competitive events.",
