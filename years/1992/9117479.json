 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical Description of Charge Transfer Processes Near Metal                 Surfaces - This project has the goal of increasing our                          understanding of charge transfer phenomena between atoms or simple              molecules and metal surfaces.  In the first part, the complex                   scaling technique will be used to calculate the electron tunneling              probabilities between excited atomic (or molecular) states and a                model metal surface.  In particular, the effects of impurity                    coadsorption and of lateral corrugation (model lattice structure)               of the surface potential on these tunneling rates will be                       investigated.  These transition rates will then be combined with a              time-dependent scattering model to allow description of charge                  transfer processes in collisions taking place between an atom (or               molecule) and a metal surface.  Again, influences specific to real              metallic surfaces will be included into the model.                              %%%                                                                             The energy and lifetime of excited states of atoms and molecules at             or near metal surfaces are controlling factors in many dynamical                phenomena taking place near surfaces.  For example, atoms bound to              the surface can be desorbed through the action of light or                      energetic electrons if an electronically excited antibonding state              has a long enough lifetime.  This lifetime, however, depends                    strongly on the interaction between the atom and the metal surface.                                                                                             Similarly, the lifetime of excited states generated in atom-surface             scattering help to determine the dispersion of the scattered beam.              The goal of this project is to develop methods for evaluating the               effect of a metal surface on a nearby atom, and to predict the                  ultimate result of this influence on the atom-surface scattering                problem.",
