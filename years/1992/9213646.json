 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to develop on apparatus for characterization of                  compressible filter cakes, and to perform a comprehensive                       research program on it.  Professor G. Chase and a graduate                      student of the University of Akron will spend two months at                     Eastman Chemical laboratory to set up the experimental                          facility in collaboration with J. Kanel of Eastman Chemical                     Co.  Experiments will be run in parallel at the Eastman                         Chemical Co. and at the University of Akron, where a second                     apparatus will be assembled for the undergraduate laboratory.                   It is expected that this project will provide useful                            scientific and applied results, as well as the basis for a                      long-term relationship between the respective university and                    industry.  The main output from the proposed apparatus will be                  results on the cake resistance and local cake porosity, which                   can be used as reference for model development, and testing                     data in industry.  The involvement of graduate and                              undergraduate students will be another benefit of this                          collaboration.                                                                                                                                                  The proposed project will accomplish well the goals of the                      \"Engineering Faculty Internships Initiative\".  Matching funds                   are provide by Eastman Chemical Co. ($16,947) and the                           University of Akron ($3,800).",
