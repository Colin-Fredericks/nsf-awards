 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. DeLaune, Patrick, and Lindau propose to conduct a field and                laboratory study of gaseous sulfur production and emissions from                Gulf Coast wetlands.  Studies of sulfur gas emissions in coastal                wetlands have not been extensive enough to establish the                        biogeochemical conditions and magnitude of sulfur gas production.               The site of this study will be Barataria Basin, Louisiana.  This                basin encompasses one of the largest and most productive estuaries              in the United States, with wetland types ranging from salt marsh                to fresh marsh.  This research will quantify the seasonal and                   diurnal gaseous fluxes to the atmosphere of H2S and organic sulfur              compounds from the wetland types.  Sulfur gases trapped in soils                will be measured and related to the atmospheric emissions.  The                 role of sediment redox conditions and organic carbon in the                     formation of gaseous sulfur forms in fresh, brackish, and salt                  marshes will also be studied using sediment redox controlled                    microcosms in the laboratory.  Gaseous sulfur compounds produced                from decomposition of added soil organic matter will be compared                to compounds produced from bacterial sulfate reduction.  The role               of wetland vegetation in production of gaseous sulfur will also be              investigated.  Drs. DeLaune, Patrick and Lindau are leading                     researchers in the area of wetland biogeochemistry.  The                        institutional facilities for this research are excellent.",
