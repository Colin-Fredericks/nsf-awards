 "awd_abstract_narration": "The multilinear extension (MLE) of a game, first introduced                as a technique for calculating the value of a game, has over the                past two decades been shown to have numerous other applications.                In this project its mathematical properties will be studied in                  some detail, with a view towards such applications as the                       computation of both symmetric and asymmetric values of large                    games, deriving other (asymmetric) values to games, developing                  solution concepts for games without side payments, and computing                reduced games.                                                                       MLE may also be used to resolve certain problems which are                 found in the current representation of some types of games.                     These include non-atomic games, which are used to represent                     economic situations of pure competition, and spatial games, which               are frequently used to model voting and coalition formation in                  political situations.  In both of these cases, the current                      representation fails to allow for some stochastic behavior on the               part of agents; the MLE (which has a probabilistic                              interpretation) can remedy this drawback.",
