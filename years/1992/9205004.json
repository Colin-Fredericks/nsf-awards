 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to understand the mechanism of the initial charge                      separation steps in bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers,                  several lines of investigation are proposed.  (i) Measurements of               the resonance Raman intensities and excitation profile for the                  lowest Qy electronic state of the special pair, combined with                   photochemical holeburning, absorption and electroabsorption (Stark              effect) spectroscopy, to obtain information on excited state                    dynamics; (ii) preparation and characterization of site-specific                mutants in the vicinity of the special pair which perturb its redox             properties to obtain information on the local dielectric properties             which may affect unidirectional electron transfer; and (iii)                    studies of the quantum yields and kinetics of RC mutants whose                  donor, acceptor and mediating state redox properties are different              from wild-type in applied electric fields to determine the                      mechanism of the fast charge separation and slower charge                       recombination reactions.                                                        %%%                                                                             Photosynthetic reaction centers are the smallest chlorophyll-                   protein complex capable of sustaining the light-induced charge                  separation reactions which initiate photosynthesis.  The first                  reactions are among the fastest reactions known in any system.  In              addition to the obvious importance of these reactions as the                    primary source of stored chemical energy on earth, these reactions              have much broader biophysical and chemical significance.  This is               because electron transfer reactions are ubiquitous in nature, and               because of the relative simplicity of this type of reaction, there              is some prospect of being able to understand the reaction mechanism             at a  fundamental level.  Bacterial reaction centers were the first             membrane protein to be characterized by x-ray crystallography, and              consequently all of our work falls under the general heading of                 structure-function relationships.  The proposed research focuses on             systematically altering the rates and mechanisms of charge-transfer             reactions in the reaction center by modifying either internal or                external electric fields.  Internal fields can be altered by                    changing specific amino acids or stretches of amino acids using                 recombinant DNA methods.  External fields can be applied either                 with electrodes to a bulk sample or as transmembrane potentials.                The latter are of very great importance in nearly all biological                assemblies and we seek to understand the mechanisms which couple                such potentials to biological function.",
