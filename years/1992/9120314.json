 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1986 pond construction on the Burnham farm, located in                       northwestern Oklahoma, uncovered three buried alluvial deposits                 which contained large numbers of faunal remains.  These included                a large-horned bison skull which resembled Bison latifrons a                    species believed to be present more than 20,000 years ago.                      Excavation by Dr. Wyckoff and his colleagues revealed the                       presence of small shattered stone flakes in association with the                bison and subsequent radiocarbon determinations have suggested a                date of between 26,000 -31,000 years ago.  If this, in fact, is                 an archaeological site, it documents the presence of humans in                  the New World well before the accepted date of ca. 12,000 years.                Dr. Wyckoff has spent several seasons excavating the Burnham site               but has not conclusively demonstrated that the materials are                    associated either with each other or an early date.  The problem                is that both stone and bone are in a derived context and have                   been carried into the area.  With National Science Foundation                   support, he will conduct the necessary geological work to answer                this question.  Mechanical equipment will be used to cut trenches               to clarify the stratigraphy.  Relevant areas with then be cleared               and careful hand excavation conducted.  It is hoped that cultural               materials in primary context and clear stratigraphic position                   will be found.                                                                                                                                                  Archaeologists agree that humans entered the New World from Asia                and that by 12,000 years ago they were widely distributed.                      However, it is unclear how much before this time original                       migration took place.  Some argue for much earlier dates while                  the majority believe that the archaeological evidence for this is               unconvincing.  The Burnham site is important within this context                and the work which Dr. Wyckoff will conduct should help to                      resolve this issue.",
