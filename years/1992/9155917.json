 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project demonstrates how the design activity, fully                        integrated with economic principles, can be effectively                         utilized to teach the engineering science component of the                      undergraduate curriculum.  The project builds on and extends                    the experimental core curriculum being developed at Texas A&M                   University (under NSF funding) such that design and economic                    principles become infused into required engineering science                     courses in the curriculum at the Georgia Institute of                           Technology.  Professors from four engineering disciplines at                    Georgia Tech will be developing and testing the experimental                    courses over several years and reporting their experiences with                 a design-focused teaching paradigm.  Additionally, a new course                 is being developed focusing on the economics of engineering                     design that bridges from the lower to the upper division in the                 undergraduate curriculum.  Professors from six different                        universities are assisting in the preparation of educational                    materials for this new course and for the economics components                  of the modified engineering science core courses.  To provide                   a second experimental test bed for this course, Virginia                        Polytechnic Institute and State University and North Carolina                   A&T State University will teach it during the second and third                  years, and the third year, respectively, of the project.                        Evaluation procedures for the modified engineering science core                 courses at Georgia Tech and for the economics of design course                  are being developed and carried out over the duration of the                    research.  Effective mechanisms for transferring results are                    planned to be developed.  Significant support exists for this                   multidisciplinary effort as evidenced by the fact that one-                     third of the entire budget is being cost-shared by                              participating institutions.  Finally, a National Visiting                       Committee is being formed to interact with the project.",
