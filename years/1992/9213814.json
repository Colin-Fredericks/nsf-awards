 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant will assist in the development of an in-depth               study of the influence of law on the role of unions in eliminating              \"hostile work environment\" sexual harassment of unionized working               women.  Although it is often thought that the presence of a union               facilitates group challenges to environmental sexual harassment,                the opposite pattern prevails in many unionized workplaces: sexual              harassment claims are typically brought by individual women, with               the union either refusing to intervene or representing the                      harasser.  This study tests the hypothesis that union practices and             attitudes interact with labor law to impede the realization of sex              equality in the workplace, undermining the union's image, and                   depriving women of a legally sanctioned avenue of collective action             and empowerment.  Patterns of union practice relating to legal                  issues raised by workplace sexual harassment of unionized women                 will be analyzed through collection and analysis of reported cases.             The issues will be further illuminated through a case study where               union women have challenged the hostile work environment without                the aid of the union.                                                                                                                                           This project promises to generate both new understandings and                   further studies of considerable value regarding struggles for legal             and social equality in the workplace.  As such it will further our              knowledge of the use of law in correcting structural disadvantages              for female workers in organized workplaces.",
