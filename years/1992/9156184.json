 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the problem of science literacy of the                   non-scientist. It will modify the curriculum and laboratory                     experiences involving the introductory astronomy course which                   is generally taken by nonscience majors as a way of satisfying                  a general education science requirement. It involves                            development of educational activities using computer                            simulations and image processing with commercial software.                      These activities include laboratories on naked eye phenomena                    involving the Voyager night sky simulation, planetary modeling                  involving the SimEarth simulation, and image processing                         involving NASA spacecraft planetary images and CCD images                       obtained locally. The Indoor Telescope, which is an extensive                   simulation of an astronomical research telescope that has been                  developed and used for the last eight years will be modified                    for more modern computers. Finally, a curriculum will be                        developed which will involve highly motivated nonscience majors                 in simple astronomical research using data obtained both with                   on-campus facilities and an Automatic Photoelectric Telescope                   located on Mt. Hopkins in southern Arizona. These innovations                   which will give nonscience students a greater opportunity to                    experience science as it is done have the potential of                          increasing the science literacy of these future leaders of                      society.",
