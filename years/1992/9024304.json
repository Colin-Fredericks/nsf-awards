 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researcher will investigate: 1) whether substrate                      enhancement occurs with other xenobiotic compounds, particularly                other substituted phenols (chloro- and methyl-) which are among the             more mobile hazardous contaminants; 2) the effect of a single                   supplemental substrate on degradation of a mixture of two or more               xenobiotic compounds by bacterial consortia in cell recycle                     systems; 3) if large populations of degrading bacteria can be                   maintained in a biofilm growing on inert particles without  added               supplemental feed; 4) whether the activated sludge floc or biofilm              morphology protects individual bacteria from toxicity effects of                xenobiotic compounds.                                                                After the laboratory experiment, the nominee will carry out                simulations at pilot- or demonstration-scale.  These will allow the             P.I. to investigate the effects of mixing, aeration and biomass                 separation, variables that are best studies in large scale, and to              verify the predictive models on large biodegradation systems.                        One benefit of this research is that phenomena identified in               pure bacterial cultures can be researched in mixed populations.                 Usually this application is made by engineers without research on               the mechanism in mixed communities of microorganisms which develop              in nonsterile field processes.  A second benefit is the                         investigation of non-specific enhancement mechanisms, like the                  growth of floc particles to retain bacteria, so that a single                   biodegradation process can be used in many contaminant removal                  systems.  Finally, some conditions which greatly affect                         biodegradation cannot be studied in bench-scale simulations.  Doing             research at a larger scale will help to avoid process failures                  which occur when scale-up effects are not understood.",
