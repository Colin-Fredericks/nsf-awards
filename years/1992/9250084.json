 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Executive Committee of Project Kaleidoscope is conducting                   two workshops on undergraduate science and mathematics                          facilities, to be held at Lake Forest College in the summer and                 fall of 1992. Project Kaleidoscope is an effort to strengthen                   science and mathematics at this nation's liberal arts colleges.                 The goal of this workshop is to present models for developing                   effective science and mathematics facilities so as to: 1) advance               the planning process for undergraduate institutions involved in                 such construction and renovation projects; 2) demonstrate how                   physical space fosters strong programs in science and                           mathematics; 3) help undergraduate institutions effectively                     manage the planning, design, and construction process in order                  to control costs and to realize the building they envisioned.                   The workshops have been designed in response to a need                          expressed by faculty and administrators at undergraduate                        institutions for sharing information about the planning and                     management of new and renovated space and for sharing successful                models.  The workshops are based on two premises of                             Project Kaleidoscope, namely that: 1) architecture and                          facilities must support good teaching and learning; and 2) we                   must work together to build on successful models, so that every                 institution learns form others in their individual efforts to                   strengthen their science and mathematics programs.",
