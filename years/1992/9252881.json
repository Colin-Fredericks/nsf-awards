 "awd_abstract_narration": "Assessment is a tool that can serve teaching and learning by                    providing teachers with a broader perspective on the                            knowledge students bring with them as they approach                             learning.  It also can help teachers to understand students'                    progress toward desired learning goals.  Therefore the                          purpose of this project is to develop:  (1)  a model which a                    community of professionals at a local level can use as a                        construct to integrate assessment with instruction in the                       service of teaching and learning science and mathematics;                       and (2)  a sample set of assessment techniques and                              strategies for selected topics in middle school science and                     mathematics that exemplify the outcomes of implementing the                     above model.                                                                                                                                                    Communities of professionals including mathematicians,                          scientists, and a measurement expert mathematics and science                    teachers and teacher educators are to be engaged in the                         development of the model and the set of exemplary assessment                    products.  These communities will (1)  decide on learning                       goals in line with the newest definitions of science and                        mathematics literacy; and (2)  determine what will count as                     evidence to indicate the extent to which these goals are                        met.  Teachers will (3)  look for such evidence in multiple                     ways including student learning journals and video                              recordings.  We will document and analyze the collaborative                     process involved in creating assessment practices that serve                    instruction so that the process can be used effectively in                      other settings.",
