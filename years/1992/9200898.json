 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses three important topics dealing with the                 foundations of knowledge bases: view updates, combining knowledge               bases, and inconsistent knowledge bases. Algorithms are developed               to provide solutions to several problems in this subject. The view              update problem is concerned with the appropriate translation of the             user's request to update a particular view into an update of the                underlying relations. Algorithms that have previously been                      developed for stratified disjunctive databases are refined by using             specialized data structures and extended to more general types of               knowledge bases. Many different but related knowledge bases have                been constructed in recent years. Previous research on combining                knowledge bases considered primarily the case of definite deductive             databases. Those algorithms are extended to more general types of               knowledge bases using the stable and well-founded semantics.                    Sometimes a knowledge base may become inconsistent. Several                     different semantics have previously been proposed to define the                 meaning of such knowledge bases in order to localize                            inconsistencies. Algorithms are produced to compute answers to                  queries under these semantics using theorem-proving techniques. The             research will be useful for the development of advanced knowledge               based systems; it will also enhance the research environment at                 Towson State University, an undergraduate institution.",
