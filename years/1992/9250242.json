The goal of the                  proposal is the active participation of their students in                       learning physics and mathematics.  The program is carrying out                  the following objectives, in order of priority:  1) It is                       putting in the hands of the General Physics students                            significant new computer-based tools to learn physics and do                    physics, specifically, a symbolic algebra system (Mathematica)                  on a powerful computer (Macintosh II Ci). These tools are                       engaging the students and are requiring the students to                         actively participating the learning process.  2) The program is                 maintaining and improving the numerical computational component                 of the General Physics Course.  3) It is updating the                           microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) capability to utilize the                  Macintosh platform.  4) The project is using Mathematica to                     begin a similar revitalization and renewal process of the                       Calculus sequence and the upper-division Mathematics courses.                   5) The astronomy software--Voyager--is being introduced into                    the Physical Science and Astronomy laboratories.  6) The                        project is creating a Scientific Computing Facility for all of                  the natural sciences and mathematics at College of the Ozarks.",
