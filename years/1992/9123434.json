 "awd_abstract_narration": "To make intelligent, cost effective decisions on ways of                        reducing industrial water-polluting emissions, for water                        remediation, and for estimating the fate, transport and                         bioaccumulation of chemicals, pure component thermodynamic                      properties and aqueous solution phase equilibrium data are                      needed.  The measurement of necessary experimental data and,                    more importantly, the development of methods to make accurate                   predictions of phase behavior in the absence to experimental                    data for such systems are the subjects of this program.                                                                                                         In particular, this program will attempt the measurement of                     phase equilibria (solubility and infinite dilution activity                     coefficients) of aqueous solutions of actual and model                          priority water pollutant chemicals, and the development of a                    new generation of group contribution prediction methods for                     such compounds.  An important characteristic of these                           chemicals is their complex, multifunctional nature.  The                        behavior of such molecules is not accurately predicted by                       current molecular thermodynamic models and, even worse, one                     must concerned above their appearance in water, a hydrogen-                     bonding solvent.  As an important part of this research, the                    investigators will use experimental data (to be measured in                     the project and obtained from the literature) and modern                        computational chemistry (molecular orbital) methods and                         molecular thermodynamic models to develop a new group                           contribution prediction procedure for multifunctional                           chemicals in aqueous solution.",
