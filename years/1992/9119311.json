 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many species of flowering plants, rates of outcrossing                  and gen dispersal vary markedly across a range of spatial scales.               Researchers have often attributed this variation to ecological                  factors that influence pollinator movements.  However, very                     little is known about the ways in which these variables affect                  the mating system of individual plants.  The proposed research                  investigates the influence of population density on patterns of                 paternity in Mimulus ringens.  This native perennial is readily                 cloned, facilitating the establishment of replicate populations                 of genetically distinct individuals.  All plants in each                        experimental population will have unique enzyme phenotypes,                     permitting assignment of paternity to all sampled offspring.                    Studies of pollinator movements, flowering phenology, and seed                  yield will be combined with detailed paternity data to test a                   series of predictions derived from ecological and evolutionary                  theory.  In addition, this study will provide an exceptionally                  detailed description of individual variation in outcrossing                     rates, gene dispersal, and male fertility and will document the                 influence of ecological factors on the patterns observed.",
