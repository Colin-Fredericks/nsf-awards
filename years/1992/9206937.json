 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear stochastic models, especially those which are                    either Markovian or may be analyzed by Markovian methods, are the               main focus of the proposal.  Among these are nonlinear                          autoregressive (-moving average) processes of much interest in                  time series analysis, and random perturbations of dynamical                     systems and flows which exhibit various phase transitions as a                  parameter changes.  The interplay between Markov processes and                  dynamical systems that this proposal explores has significant                   consequences to both fields.  For those Markov processes which                  approach a unique steady state as time progresses, a further                    object of study is the central limit theorem and its refinement                 by asymptotic expansions.  These refinements have applications in               diverse areas such as bootstrapping in time series, and singular                perturbation expansions of large time solutions of a class of                   partial differential equations which arise in the prediction of                 the spread of contaminants in an aquifer.                                            Random processes which occur in nature may often be regarded               as a deterministic system perturbed by random noise.  Just as the               nature of the deterministic part greatly influences the behavior                of the random process, the statistical behavior of the random                   process may also be used in predicting the large time behavior of               the deterministic system itself.  This latter study is                          particularly useful in analyzing complex deterministic systems                  such as those arising in the study of turbulence.  The present                  proposal seeks to explore this interplay between deterministic                  and random processes.  Another object is the refinement of                      precise statistical laws governing the long-run average behavior                of many important random phenomena.  Among diverse potential                    applications are bootstrapping in time series and the prediction                of the spread of contaminants in an aquifer.",
