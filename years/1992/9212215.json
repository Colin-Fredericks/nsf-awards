 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in the area of upper mesospheric and lower                        thermospheric physics and chemistry has experienced a revival of                interest over the past decade. The importance of this region has                become increasingly apparent through modelling studies while                    advances in observational techniques have allowed an increase in                our empirical understanding. This is the region of the Earth's                  atmosphere about which the least is known, owing to the difficulty              of making detailed measurements of the important parameters.                    Furthermore, current research has pointed towards the possibility               of rapid anthropogenic change in the region. This Chapman                       Conference will provide an opportunity for the international                    community of aeronomers and atmospheric scientists to engage in                 focused discussion of progress in studies of the lower thermosphere             and upper mesosphere in a variety of areas using modelling as well              as empirical approaches.                                                             These discussions will be particularly timely, in view of the              efforts currently underway under the auspices of the Coupling                   Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) initiative.              This initiative,  which is an authorized component of the Solar                 Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP), encompasses several activities               which address various questions regarding the physics and chemistry             of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere, including the Lower             Thermospheric Coupling Study (LTCS or MLTCS), Coupling and Dynamics             of Equatorial Regions (CADER), ARIA, and AIDA. In addition to Cedar             activities, the NASA TIMED (Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere                  Energetics and Dynamics) Mission, planned for the mid-1990's, is                invigorating researchers toward the development of improved                     observational techniques.",
