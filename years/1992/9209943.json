 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two objectives.  One is to develop a theoretical               understanding of a generic environmental problem of which global                warming and acid deposition are two examples.  That problem is                  the optimal tradeoff between acting to control environmental                    externalities versus delaying control when faced with uncertainty               coupled with learning.  The second objective is to apply one or                 more of these theoretical models to the global warming problem,                 addressing the policy question of the extent to which the U.S.                  and other countries should control greenhouse gas emissions now                 versus waiting until more is known about the problem before                     controlling.  This is one of the key issues in the public policy                debate on global warming and, thus, results of this project may                 be very significant.  The two driving features of the models                    developed will be learning that occurs over time reducing                       uncertainty and the stock feature of externalities such as global               warming, whereby the stock causes damage but only the flow can be               controlled.  The approach of the theoretical part of the project                is to develop a stochastic optimal control problem and to                       investigate the comparative static properties of the resulting                  model.  The empirical portion of the project will numerically                   implement one of the theoretical models to the extent necessary                 to develop policy conclusions.  This will involve adapting an                   empirical model developed elsewhere, perhaps the Nordhaus model,                rather than developing a totally new one.",
