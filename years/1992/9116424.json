 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a U.S.-Japan cooperative research project                   between Professor Bikram  Gill, Department of Plant Pathology,                  Kansas State University, and Professor Takashi Endo, Institute of               Natural Science, Nara University.  This two-year project, which                 also involves Professor Rama Kota of Kansas State University, will              use the approach of genetically-induced deletion mapping to                     construct comprehensive cytogenetic maps of individual                          chromosomes of common wheat.  The chromosome deletions are                      caused by certain Aegilops chromosomes when added to wheat.                     These so-called \"gametocidal\" chromosomes will be used to                       construct unique deletion stocks.  Deletion mapping with multigenic             tester stocks consisting of morphological, physiological, protein,              and DNA marker loci will also be undertaken.  The size and                      breakage-point in deletion chromosomes will be identified by C-                 banding and in situ hybridization techniques in order to determine              the physical location of specific genetic markers.                                                                                                              This is a no-cost proposal for NSF.  It is required because the                 Japanese counterpart proposal to the Japan Society for the                      Promotion of Science (JSPS) requests funding for the Japanese                   investigators.  The award will combine the research interests of the            U.S. investigators on physical mapping of the genome of wheat                   with the research of the Japanese investigators on the production of            deletion stocks.",
