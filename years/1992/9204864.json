 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general goal of this project is the development of                     statistical theory that is likely to be of direct use to                        statistical practitioners.  Specific projects are developed                     around the theme of computer-intensive statistical inference.                   Special topics include bootstrap, jackknife and related                         resampling methods, permutation tests and group theoretic testing               procedures, Gibbs sampling and Markov chains.  All these topics                 concern data mappings of special interest to statisticians.                     Historically, permutations were the first such mappings studied.                Methods like the bootstrap generalize permutations to wider                     classes of statistical problems, at the expense of less                         mathematical neatness and greater computational expense.  This                  project addresses ways to overcome these obstacles.                                  Statistical inference is the science of generalization from                observed data, often just a small amount, to the larger                         population from which the data were drawn.  The basic principles                of statistical inference were laid down before World War II.  The               basic theory was built around classical mathematics and the bell-               shaped curve.  Computer-intensive methods, developed in the last                15 years, aim to extend the range, ease, and plausibility of                    statistical arguments.  They substitute specially-developed                     computer algorithms of classical mathematical approximations                    relating to the bell-shaped curve.  Our research aims to justify                these algorithms.  Mathematical and computational arguments are                 used to show that the algorithms automatically produce the                      classical answers when such answers exist, and still give good                  answers in the much more common circumstance of problems having                 no classical solution.",
