 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major findings during the past thirty years of brain                 research is that experience can play an important role in the                   development of synapses.  Dr. Lnenicka's research examines how the              structure and function of the synaptic connections between nerve                cells are influenced by experience.  Synapses between nerve cells               play an important role in the flow of information through the                   nervous system and changes in synaptic properties have been shown               to have a direct effect on behavior.  A key question in nervous                 system development is how the properties of the synapses are                    specified.  In order to examine activity-dependent synaptic changes             with the precision not presently possible in the complex mammalian              brain, Dr. Lnenicka will study these synaptic changes in the                    simpler invertebrate nervous system.  Findings from his studies                 will provide information on the basic mechanisms of experience                  dependent synaptic development.  The results of Dr. Lnenicka's                  study are likely to be important for understanding important                    problems in neurobiology such as the cellular basis of plasticity               in the nervous system.  It is also likely that results obtained                 with this type of research can have foreseeable application in the              domain of public health.  For instance, recovery of function after              peripheral nerve injury may be improved by applying procedures                  derived from a better knowledge of the factors affecting synaptic               remodelling.***//",
