 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two primary goals of the research proposed in this                    planning grant:  1) to investigate the reliability of the sister                group relationship between the bumble bees and stingless bees (two              tribes of the family Apidae) inferred from a recent parsimony                   analysis of mitochondrial rRNA sequences; and 2) to provide the                 phylogenetic foundation for developing a long term research program             focusing on the evolution of social traits within the primitively               eusocial apid tribe Bombini (bumble bees) by constructing a                     phylogeny of the species within the behaviorally diverse bumble bee             subgenus Fervidobombus. The results of this nested phylogenetic                 investigation will provide knowledge of the appropriate outgroup to             the bumble bees, a necessity for understanding relationships within             the bumble bees.  Resolution of the relationships within                        Fervidobombus will provide the foundation for understanding many of             the behavioral transitions from relatively simple to more complex               social behavior that have occurred within the subgenus. Ultimately,             this interdisciplinary approach, which integrates systematics and               animal behavior by using phylogenies to test hypotheses of                      behavioral transformation, will increase understanding and                      collaboration between these two important disciplines of                        evolutionary biology.  The study will also increase understanding               of the biology of an important group of insect pollinators of wild              and crop plants. //",
