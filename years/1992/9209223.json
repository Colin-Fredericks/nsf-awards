 "awd_abstract_narration": "U.S. GLOBec (GLOBal Ocean ECosystem--a part of the U.S. global                  change program) is a scientific effort designed to evaluate the                 consequences of global climate change, and the concomitant changes              in physical transports in the sea, on the sustainability of animal              production in the ocean.  The program seeks to understand how                   physical processes influence the success of individual animals in               the sea--their feeding, growth, reproduction, and survivorship.                 Models of global climate can then be used to relate global change               to changes in regional ocean physics and, subsequently, changes in              regional physics to modifications at the spatial scales that                    influence individual organisms.  Effects on zooplankton life stages             will be emphasized because so many marine animals undergo at least              one planktonic life stage and because the planktonic size classes               are most at the mercy of the physics of their fluid environment.                                                                                                This project seeks to maintain a U.S. GLOBEC Coordinating Office to             carry out the many functions necessary for such a large inter-                  disciplinary program.  The tasks of such an office fall into                    four broad categories.  First, planning and coordination activities             associated with the efforts--largely meetings--of the Scientific                Steering Committee (SSC).  Second, specifics of logistics and                   support for the SSC.  Third, communications with the large and                  diverse GLOBEC community in the U.S. (and overseas)--involving both             physical and biological oceanographers, as well as fisheries                    specialists.  Finally, a new endeavor, planning and coordination                with the recently-formed international program.                                                                                                                 Professor Thomas M. Powell will assume the chairmanship of the U.S.             GLOBEC SSC before 1 May 1992.  The Coordinating Office will move to             its new home, at Powell's institution, in the Division of                       Environmental Studies at the University of California, Davis.",
