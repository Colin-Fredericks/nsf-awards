For a one-year period beginning in                  April 1992, eight (8) undergraduates students will spend ten (10)               weeks engaged in research, under the direction of seven (7) members             of the chemistry faculty.  At least six of the 8 REU Program                    participants will be chosen from a pool of applicants who attend                institutions other than Trinity University, and every attempt will              be made to bring four students from underrepresented minorities                 into this program each year.  The research programs in which these              students will be engaged are designed to offer them operational                 knowledge of modern chemical instrumentation, opportunities for                 contributions to publishable research, and experiences in effective             communication of their results.  As a result of their experiences,              REU student participants will understand in greater depth the                   wealth of choices available to them in the chemical profession, and             they will have an increased orientation toward further education in             the chemical sciences.",
