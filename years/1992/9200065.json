 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue a successful Research                     Experiences for Undergraduates Site program in the Department of                Biological Sciences at the University of Missouri-Columbia.  The                Department will work in partnership with a select group of                      undergraduate institutions, including predominantly minority                    institutions, to provide students with the kind of research                     experience only available at a major comprehensive research                     university.  This REU program will complement an internship program             for MU students funded through a grant from the Howard Hughes                   Medical Institute.  Faculty participant's research programs center              on the theme \"Cellular, Molecular and Genetic Approaches to                     Biological Problems,\" and utilize methodology raging from                       recombinant DNA technology, to immunocytochemistry, to                          sophisticated electrophysiology.  All participating faculty are                 personally involved in their research projects, are well-funded,                and have a history of successful partnerships with undergraduates               interns.  While the research experience is the cornerstone of the               summer program,  multiple and varied opportunities for the students             to develop their communication skills, and the opportunity to                   present their research at local and regional scientific meetings                are provided.  Finally, a number of enrichment activities including             seminars by research faculty, an informal evening program \"Science              and Scientists,\" and a panel discussion on selecting and applying               to graduate schools have been developed.",
