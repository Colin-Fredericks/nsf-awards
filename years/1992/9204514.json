 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scaling equations form a class of functional equations                     arising in a wide variety of applications including wavelets,                   sub-division schemes for computer generation of curves and                      surfaces and iterated function systems, the fundamental tools of                fractal geometry.  This project continues mathematical research                 on the representation of solutions to scaling equations (scaling                functions) in terms of infinite matrix product expansions.  At                  the present time, the convergence of the product is dependent on                a contractivity assumption.  The terms of the infinite product                  are chosen from a finite set of matrices and combined in a                      certain deterministic manner.  That all possible finite products                appear lead to investigations into bounded semi-groups of                       matrices.  Work will be done investigating weaker assumptions                   involving bounded semi-groups and establishing weaker                           contractivity conditions on the corresponding products in terms                 of the Lyapunov exponent.  A second goal of this project is that                of using infinite matrix product expansions to establish iterated               function system algorithms for the construction of scaling                      functions and to analyze their regularity and dimensionality.                   The work will concentrate primarily in the multi-dimensional                    setting where the most important applications lie.                                   At the heart of wavelet theory is the simultaneous local                   decomposition of functions in space and frequency.  Applications                of this goal abound in mathematical analysis, signal processing,                statistics and data compression.  In combining the underlying                   principles with that of iterated function systems, this work                    leads naturally to important techniques for compression and                     reconstruction of television and other communication signals.",
