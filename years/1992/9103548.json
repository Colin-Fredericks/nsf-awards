 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will provide a coherent data set consisting of                   bathymetry, geophysics petrology, and hydrothermal activity for a               substantial length of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge affected by the                    Azores hotspot.  The overall aim to find the links among the                    diverse types of data in order to contribute to more                            comprehensive models of ocean crust formation. Petrologic                       sampling of a diversity of segment types will reveal the scale of               petrological segmentation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the                        relationships between petrological variations and segment type,                 and provide data to test geophysical models of the organization                 and mechanism of melt segregation and supply to the crust.  Also,               sufficient sampling to define the fractionation trends for                      individual segments and to investigate the relationship between                 major and trace element variations should reveal far more about                 the nature of the Azores hotspot. Hydrothermal studies are                      designed to inventory as completely as possible the amount of                   geothermal mass and heat stored over this redge section, and to                 establish the number and location of any hydrothermally active                  areas on this section of the ridge.",
