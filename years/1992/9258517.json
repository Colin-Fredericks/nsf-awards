 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is concerned with language modeling and                handwriting.  The goal of the language modeling research is to                  represent the computations performed in the comprehension,                      production, and acquisition of human languages.  Computations may               be described at various levels of abstraction:  as a sequence of                state transitions (least abstract), as an algorithm (more                       abstract), and as a computational problem (most abstract).  The                 first step in the proposed research is to characterize the three                central computations of human language (comprehension, production,              and acquisition) at the highest level of abstraction, as                        computational problems.  Each such problem statement is a                       computational theory of a portion of language.  The total sum of                all such problem statements is a comprehensive computational theory             of human language.  The goal of the handwriting recognition                     research is to accurately model the human handwriting process. Such             a model is, crucial to improving current handwriting recognition                technology.  To accomplish this, the statistical constraint                     inherent in handwriting, including physical constraints arising                 from the biomechanics of the pen/hand system, motor-perceptual                  constraints arising from the shared desire to communicate                       efficiently and reliably, and constraint due to the ad-hoc                      convention of handwriting, such as the chosen alphabet and language             is explicitly modeled.  //",
