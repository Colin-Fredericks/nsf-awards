 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the ethnographic research of a graduate                   student from Harvard University in a rural area of China.  The                  student will interview community members about their notions of                 history.  The focus will not be on the accuracy of popular                      memory, but rather on the social processes that select and create               memory out of the available material. Using participant                         observation and in depth interviews the student (a Chinese native               fluent in the local language) will systematically collect images                and knowledge of the distant and recent past, analyzing how                     individual rationalizations of past behavior have a moral and                   social basis.  The local community is an apt place to do the                    research since it was relocated in 1958, and thus has a specific                event of collective suffering to deal with.                                                                                                                     This research is important because local communities have long                  memories which are often used to justify current action.                        Understanding of the social processes which shape these memories                can help us understand and deal with current political and social               behavior in similar villages.",
