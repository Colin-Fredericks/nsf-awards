 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the effect of various types of                   interventions on the longevity of knowledge.  One investigation                 will determine the individual and joint effects of the number of                training sessions and of the interval between training sessions                 on retention of foreign language vocabulary over a period of                    several years.  Other investigations will focus on the                          maintenance of access to marginal semantic memory content.  Such                information is reliably identified on tests of recognition, but                 it is recalled only some of the time; success or failure of an                  attempt to recall this sort of information depends upon momentary               context conditions.  The goals of this research are to establish                the effects of interventions that either decrease the probability               of losing access to marginal memory targets that are momentarily                not accessible (preventive maintenance) or re-establish access to               targets that are momentarily not accessible (corrective                         maintenance).  These investigations will establish the half-life                of several types of preventive and corrective interventions for                 several types of memory content for young and old adults.                       Another investigation will explore the possibility of extending                 the life-span of knowledge acquired in a statistics course by                   increased spacing of training sessions and by computer-aided                    instruction.  This research can provide the basis for effective                 schedules and types of interventions designed to assure                         continuing access to knowledge acquired in schools.  The research               is also relevant to the formulation of guidelines for the                       maintenance of professional expertise in various domains of                     public interest.",
