 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growing interest in sophisticated structures such as next                     generation composite aircraft and large space structures, places                increasing demands on the optimality of the structural components               used.  These demands are met by improving both the accuracy and                 efficiency of the computational tools used to develop and                       analyze these structures.  However, the computational demands of                these systems are so great, that engineers must frequently be                   satisfied with rather crude and simplified models in order to                   speed up the design cycle time.  The true potential for execution               improvement lies in improved solution algorithms and parallel                   computing.  This interdisciplinary research program will focus on               the design of efficient parallel computational methods for the                  finite element analysis of such complex structures.  The research               includes three components:  computational mechanics, applied                    mathematics and applied computer sciences.  The first component                 involves the development of discrete mathematical models based on               finite elements for representing aerospace structures as                        assemblies of beams, plates and shells.  The second component                   addresses the design of domain decomposition methods for static,                transient, and vibration analyses using those models.  The last                 research component aims to tuning these methods to massively                    parallel supercomputers.",
