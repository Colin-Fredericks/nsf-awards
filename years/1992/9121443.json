This type of analysis                                              is complicated, because the bases                                               of these tanks separate from and                                                lift off their foundations during                                               strong ground motion excitations.                                               This base uplift changes the                                                    dynamic behavior of these                                                       structures considerably and leads                                               to severe loading conditions that                                               can lead to stress or buckling                                                  failures and subsequent loss of                                                 contents.  To advance the design of                                             such structures, the response of                                                the tank and its contents due to                                                both lateral and vertical base                                                  excitation must be modeled.                                                                                                                                     Attention will be paid to the                                                   formulation of the nonlinear base                                               uplift problem.  Effects due to                                                 shell flexibility, liquid sloshing                                              and ground flexibility will be                                                  investigated.                                                                                                                                                   Results of this research effort                                                 will improve the seismic                                                        performance of liquid storage tanks                                             related to critical urban services                                              such as petroleum storage, water                                                supply, and other distribution                                                  systems.",
