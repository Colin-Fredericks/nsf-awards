 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall theme of this NSF Young Investigator Award                          research program is the utilization of mathematical tools for                   nonlinear analysis and computational tools for optimization in                  the synthesis of advanced controllers for chemical process                      control.  Dr. Doyle's principal research interests are in four                  categories:                                                                                                                                                     (1) Nonlinear Process Control, Optimization, and                                Identification -He plans to look at an efficient fusion of                      off-line and on-line techniques and identification (from data)                  of nonlinear plant models to be used for controller design.                     Initially theoretical issues of nonlinear control synthesis,                    performance analysis, and nonlinear optimization will be                        addressed, followed by work aimed at dealing with unmeasured                    disturbances and unmodeled dynamics.                                                                                                                            (2) Computational Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems -                     Control algorithms based on large order nonlinear models tend                   to be quite accurate at the expense of the complex nonlinear                    program which has to be solved for the optimal control action.                  The PI plans to develop accurate, low order nonlinear process                   models for industrial process operations which are to be                        validated against physical data.  An example is the use of                      wave propagation models he has used to develop control                          algorithms for packed bed reactors and distillation columns.                                                                                                    (3) Waste Management and Detection - Two areas of concern are                   waste water treatment and the control of harmful atmospheric                    emissions from combustion processes.  The key elements of                       these problems are the lack of primary measurements and                         extremely nonlinear behavior.  The PI plans to address these                    problems using nonlinear inferential control.                                                                                                                   (4) Biological Regulation - Homeostasis is the coordinated                      actions which maintain the steady states in a living body and                   is similar to the control mechanisms used for a complex                         chemical factory.  The PI plans to study the underlying                         paradigm of physiological regulation for use in developing                      improved medical treatments to assist the natural regulatory                    and defense mechanisms of the body.",
