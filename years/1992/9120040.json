 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Jack Harris, Mr Sileshi Semaw will                   collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct                     archaeological research in the Awash Valley region of Ethiopia.                 Prior work by Mr. Semaw as well as others has revealed the                      presence of archaeological materials in the Gona River drainage.                Based on geological analysis the Gona sites date to approximately               2.5 million years ago and this makes them among the oldest known.               Mr. Semaw will now follow up on this earlier work.  He will                     conduct a survey of the Gona region to locate additional sites.                 He will undertake a large scale excavation to study the nature                  and character of in situ archaeological occurrences.  Data thus                 gathered from surface and excavated settings will provide                       evidence on the ecology and activities of the hominids who                      manufactured the artifacts.  Finally studies will be initiated to               determine the presence or absence of culturally modified bones.                                                                                                 While it is known that early humans began to make recognizable                  stone tools ca. 2.5 million years ago, little else is known about               their behavior.  This, in large part, results from the fact that                very few sites dating from this time period are known.  Because                 the Gona site includes both in situ lithics as well as faunal                   remains, it is extremely important.  The excavations and analyses               that Mr. Semaw will conduct may answer questions on the dietary                 and cultural adaptations of these hominids.  It is not known for                example whether hunting or meat eating was practiced.                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data of interest to many anthropologists.  It will also assist in               the training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
