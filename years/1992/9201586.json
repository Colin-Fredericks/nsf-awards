 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator continues research in matrix inequalities                 and their applications.  The objectives of this project are to                  (a) extend the perturbation theory for functions of matrices, and               develop efficient algorithms to compute the condition number for                these functions, (b) derive good perturbation bounds for matrix                 factorizations, (c) extend the theory of matrix norms, in                       particular unitary similarity invariant norms, and the induced                  norms of Hadamard multipliers.  Projects (a) and (b) have                       applications in numerical linear algebra.  The problems of (c)                  are of interest in their own right and are relevant to obtaining                the results in (a) and (b).                                                          There are some unavoidable errors in numerical calculations.               For example, whenever calculations are done by computer there is                the possibility that small roundoff errors will be incurred --                  for example, 1/3 = 0.333333... may approximated by 0.3333.                      Another source of errors is that the input data may be the result               of measurements that are not exact.  It is possible that these                  small errors can cause a large error in the final answer -- so                  large that it is useless.  The investigator studies the effects                 of small errors in numerical linear algebraic calculations.  This               will help one to decide whether a particular method of                          calculation produces reliable results, and to know in advance                   what accuracy is needed in measurements to ensure a given                       accuracy in the final answer.",
