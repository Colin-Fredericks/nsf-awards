 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a               4-wheel drive vehicle for use by University of Rhode Island field               geologists. The University is committed to providing matching funds             for the acquisition and has submitted a maintenance and operation               plan that ensures its efficient use.                                                 The Principal Investigator and colleagues in the Department                of Geology at the University of Rhode Island have an active program             of research on the evolution of life in the area of the Gulf of                 Mexico during the Mesozoic period. Unique early-to-middle-Jurassic-             aged vertebrate fossils (including one of the earliest mammals                  known and rare reptilian and dinosaur forms) and excellent rock                 exposures are found in northeastern Mexico, and much of the                     research of the Rhode Island team during the field season is                    concentrated in Huizachal Canyon, Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains.              The remoteness of most of their field area and the geographic                   breadth to be covered requires reliable transportation.",
