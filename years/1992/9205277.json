 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns polynomial invariants in knot theory,                particularly the Jones polynomial and its generalizations.  Along               with knot theory, the project is integrally involved with related               problems in combinatorics, generalized spin networks, quantum                   groups, statistical mechanics, and invariants of 3-manifolds.  In               particular, it addresses a tangle-theoretic recoupling theory for               the Temperley-Lieb algebra and its relationship with invariants of              graph embeddings, the SL(2) quantum group, and the Turaev-Viro                  invariant of 3-manifolds.  This recoupling theory gives a                       completely tangle-theoretic version of quantum 6j coefficients at               roots of unity, and it permits the construction of the Turaev-Viro              invariant on a purely knot-theoretic basis.  These topics will be               explored in the context of the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants             of 3-manifolds.  Other problems about link polynomials will be                  considered, such as the properties of statistical mechanical models             for the Alexander-Conway polynomial and relations with four-                    dimensional topology.                                                                Knots are rather elementary geometric objects whose really                 interesting properties are topological.  By this we mean that two               geometric knots do not differ in an interesting way if one of them              can be transformed to look just like the other without cutting or               untying it, just by pushing its string about to rearrange the                   crossings.  Topologists say that they are two different geometric               realizations of the same topological knot.  Nevertheless, it is not             a trivial matter to recognize when one complicated geometric knot               is topologically different from another, rather than just a                     different geometric realization.  This problem can be addressed by              computing certain numbers or polynomials which are called                       \"topological invariants,\" meaning that they always have the same                value for different geometric realizations of the same topological              knot.  The problem would be reduced to pure algebra if there were               one invariant which also always had different values for geometric              realizations of different topological knots, but life is not so                 simple -- no single invariant achieves this ideal, nor even all the             known invariants taken together.  It is therefore valuable to                   investigate new invariants, some of the most useful being those                 inspired in recent years by ideas from quantum physics. In                      particular, applications of knot theory to the biology of long                  strands of DNA have drawn upon knowledge of these newer invariants.",
