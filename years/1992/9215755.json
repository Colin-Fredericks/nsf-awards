 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on issues involved in the development                of a generic architecture for intelligent networked colocation in               concurrent engineering.  Constraints networks have been identified              by the principal investigators as an elegant and powerful technique             that can be used as basis for concurrent engineering.  In previous              work, the basic constraint specification language and constraint                processing algorithms were determined, implemented, and tested.                 The utility of this approach has been demonstrated via applications             to numerous domains.  Currently, this scope is being widened with               particular emphasis on early system decision making as well as                  detailed design for electronics packaging.                                           By investigating application to this subject area in depth,                it is expected that generic techniques will be determined that will             apply both here and to other areas of engineering design.  As part              of this effort, research is being conducted in constraint-based                 language issues such as optimization, alternative modes of                      abstraction of knowledge, seamless interfaces to point design                   tools, learning, and uncertainty.",
