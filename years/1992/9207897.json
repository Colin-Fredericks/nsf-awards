 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major assumption of isothermal changes in the \"old\"                         liquid-phase sintering model is notsuitable for the actual                      processings.  This project proposes to use the transmission                     electron microscope (TEM) to observe the actual nanometer                       events.  The observed TEM data will be used to change the \"old\"                 quantitative expressions as developed by Kingery in 1959.                       Observations of microsctructural changes and rates of change                    during the heating-up process, with emphasis on material                        distribution and distribution changes, will be made.  Quantitative              expressions will be formulated for the processes during the                     heating-up process with additives.  These processes develop                     ultimately into liquid-phase sintering.  The study will begin with              the Al2O3-TiO2 system.                                                          %%%%                                                                            This project examines the heating-up process with the presence                  of actives.  Microscopic observations in nanoscales will be made                of the microstructural changes and their rates of change with                   emphasis on material distribution and distribution changes.  The                study begins with the hypothesis that the focal point should be on              the distribution, crystallinity, and properties of boundaries and               surface \"phases\", which are present to allow acclerated material                transfer.  This study challenges the applications of the quantitative           expressions the PI developed many years ago.  This study aims                   to develop new expressions which will have a profound effect in                 catalyzing rapid and innovative advances, not only in ceramic                   processing, but also in ceramic sciences as well as in powder                   metallurgy.",
