 "awd_abstract_narration": "The earliest stage of neural development relies on a decision                   making process that determines whether groups of uncommitted cells              are directed into a neural pathway of development or a pathway that             produces skin.  This process is fundamental and shared by a wide                range of organisms, including human.  In the fruit fly, this                    decision is regulated by a group of genes called the neurogenic                 loci whose gene products mediate intercellular communication.                   Molecular studies of these loci have demonstrated that they encode              membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins.  The mastermind (mam)               gene, is a member of the neurogenic loci that codes for a nuclear               protein with a novel structure.  It is the only member of these                 loci where sequence information has not provided a clear model for              function.  To understand the function of the mam gene, three                    strategies will be undertaken.  First, the hypothesis that mam                  encodes a DNA binding regulatory protein will be tested.  This will             involve biochemical assays, and the use of a new yeast selection                system that may elucidate the targets of mam regulation in the                  nucleus. Secondly, a screen for a temperature-sensitive mam allele              will be made in order to inactivate the mam protein at any time                 during development and observe the consequences of mam elimination              on neural development.  Thirdly, genetic screens for modifiers of               mam function will be performed.  These screens may produce                      mutations in genes that interact with mam and also play a role in               early neural development.  It is expected that a complete                       characterization of the mam protein and interacting genes will                  provide new insights into neural development that are generally                 relevant to many species.",
