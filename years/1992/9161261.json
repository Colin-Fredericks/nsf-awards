 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and related processes have been               developed as a means of producing synthetic diamond at relatively               low temperatures and pressures.  However, in spite of recent                    progress, CVD diamond is less than satisfactory because the                     deposits are polycrystalline in form with grains of varying sizes               and orientations.                                                                    Ion implantation of diamond and polycrystalline diamond (an                alternative technique) creates substantial radiation damage,                    amorphization, and ultimately graphitization.  The ion bombarded                layers created on diamond substrates are substantially softer than              the bulk materials, and are therefore much easier to polish.  This              project will provide a proof-of-principle study, demonstrating a                process for polishing polycrystalline diamond which consists of ion             implantation followed by mechanical polishing.  Optical quality                 finishes significantly better than those which can be obtained from             mechanical polishing alone are produced by such sequential                      implantation and polishing; it is anticipated that this process                 will significantly simplify the polishing of polycrystalline                    diamond.",
