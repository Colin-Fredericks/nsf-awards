 "awd_abstract_narration": "Portfolio models and models of capital market equilibrium play an               important role in financial economics.  Past work by the                        investigator developed and tested these models and extended the                 reasoning of financial economics to issues in macroeconomics.  The              project continues this line of research by studying systematically              the variables that explain the cross-section of expected stock                  returns.  The existing literature identifies many variables (firm               size, leverage, market to book value of equity, earnings-to-price               ratios, measures of risk) that are related to the cross-section of              expected returns.  Preliminary suggest that the cross-section                   variation in expected returns can be explained by just two factors,             the size of the firm and the market to book equity value.  The                  robustness of this empirical finding will be checked.  The ultimate             goal is a comprehensive empirical description and an explanation                of the interaction between business conditions, the cross-section               of expected returns, and the variation through time in expected                 returns.  The project also continues a study of the permanent and               temporary variation in output and its components, especially                    investment.  This work is important in its own right and it will                eventually lead to a more detailed explanation of the links between             expected returns the real activity.                                                                                                                             The detailed study by this project of the relations between the                 variation of expected returns through time and the structure of                 expected returns across financial markets contributes to our                    understanding of the efficiency of capital markets, i.e., the                   general notion that in pricing securities the market correctly uses             all relevant available information.  Recent work has shown there                is much variation in the expected returns on common stocks,                     Government bonds, and corporate bonds.  Some scholars claim that                \"excessive\" variation in the capital markets is evidence of                     irrational fads.  This project demonstrates that there are stable               empirical relationships between the variation and dividend yields               and term-structure variables that are common to a wide range of                 securities and related to business conditions.",
