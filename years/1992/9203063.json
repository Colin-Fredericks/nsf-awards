This project will test and refine present                models of bacterial associations within the gut of sediment deposit             feeders.  Bacteria ingested into the gut and exposed to lytic                   activity of gut enzymes, both in terms of space and time, will be               examined in the two deposit feeders, Arenicola marina and                       Amphitrite johnsonii.  Controlled experiments will be employed to               clarify the influences of temperature, enzyme concentration,                    exposure time, and the interactions among these variables on the                lysis of bacterial strains within the gut.  Further experiments                 will determine to what degree quantity, as opposed to composition,              of extra-cellular capsular layer dictates resistance to digestion.              Also, lysis of bacterial strains devoid of capsular material will               be compared to ascertain the importance of cell wall                            characteristics in bacterial lysis.  The goals of these experiments             are to determine how environmental parameters influence lysis of                bacterial communities and to distinguish mechanisms for                         differential lysis, in order to make a priori predictions of                    natural patterns within the guts of deposit feeders.  These                     predictions will then be tested in the field using epifluorescence              microscopy coupled with the relevant measurements of environmental              conditions and immunofluorescence microscopy to specifically track              three bacterial isolates through the guts of the two model deposit              feeders.  This research will also determine whether deposit feeder              digestion, both in terms of total biomass or selective removal, is              an important determinant of bacterial biomass or community                      composition in bulk sediments.",
