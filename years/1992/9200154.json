The major                   objective is to increase student motivation to pursue and succeed               in the mechanical engineering profession.  Research experiences are             used 1) to demonstrate the relevance and professional applications              of basic and advanced course work, 2) to provide experiences in the             challenges and rewards of research and, thus, encouragement to                  pursue graduate degrees; and 3) to build mentoring bonds between                faculty and undergraduates which encourage retention and graduation             of members of underrepresented groups.",
