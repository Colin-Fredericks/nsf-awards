Most building                                             codes prescribe uniformly                                                       distributed static design live                                                  loads for offices, corridors, and                                               public assembly areas such as                                                   shopping malls, airport terminals,                                              gymnasia and dance floors.  PIs'                                                previous studies have defined                                                   forces caused by in situ                                                        activities.  The objectives of the                                              research are:  (a) to define the                                                dynamic loads generated by                                                      activities involving motion such as                                             walking and running; and (b) to                                                 establish the benefits and                                                      efficiency of low power semiactive                                              control technologies to mitigate                                                excessive structural response due                                               to phase related occupant loads.  A                                             special force platform, with a flat                                             transfer function in the frequency                                              range of the anticipated loads,                                                 will be constructed, instrumented                                               and used to measure forces                                                      generated by one, two, and groups                                               of subjects while performing                                                    prescribed activities.  Loads due                                               to individuals and groups will be                                               characterized using analytical                                                  functions, multivariate regression                                              analysis, and random simulation.                                                Simulated results will be compared                                              with measured data for small groups                                             and design loads will be suggested                                              both in time and frequency domains.                                             A lightweight test floor system                                                 will be constructed in the second                                               phase of the project.  The dynamic                                              characteristics of the floor system                                             will be determined experimentally                                               and analytically.  The structure                                                will be instrumented with a                                                     variable damper device.  The                                                    variation in damping will be                                                    accomplished by using variable area                                             in the damper mechanisms.  The test                                             floor will be loaded by both in                                                 situ and moving occupants and the                                               response will be controlled using a                                             closed loop system.",
