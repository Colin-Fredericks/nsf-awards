 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regulation of mRNA translation constitutes an important aspect                  in the control of gene expression mammalian cells.  Most                        examples of translational control involve modulation of the                     initiation phase of protein synthesis.  Two kinds of initiation                 events can be distinguished either of which may be regulated: 1)                initiation on polysomes, thereby maintaining a full complement                  of ribosomes on the mRNAs; and 2) initiation on messenger                       ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles, thereby mobilizing non-                     active mRNAs into active polysomes.  The latter event is                        poorly understand, yet its regulation is encountered                            frequently.  The PIs propose to characterize proteins that bind                 to mRNP particles and that mask their activiies.  One such                      protein of 50 kDa has been purified in Pushchino, and its                       mechanism of action as a translational inhibitor will be                        probed.  Its site of binding to mRNAs will be determined, and                   the inhibited step of protein synthesis will be identified.                     They also plan to clone its cDNA and determine the effect of                    overexpression in transfected mammalian cells.  Preliminary                     evidence from Puschino suggests that the 50 kDa protein may                     itself be regulated by an \"activator\"; the \"activator\" will                     be purified and characterized.  These studies rely on classical                 biochemical techniques of protein purification and chemistry                    presently used in both Davis and Puschino, employ in vitro                      cell-free translatiion systems, some highly fractionated and                    reconstituted with purified initiatiion factors from Davis, and                 employ state-of-the-art transfection methods.                                   %%%                                                                             The project is designed to shed light on the basic molecular                    mechanisms of how mRNP particles are activated and inhibited                    for translation, and thus should help elucidate this major                      poorly understood area of gene regulation.",
