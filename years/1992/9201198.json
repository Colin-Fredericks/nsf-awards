Structurally homogeneous poly(3-alkylthiophenes)                    and poly(3-alkylpyrroles) will be prepared using principles of                  self-assembly through inter- and intramolecular hydrogen                        bonding. Structural homogeneity will limit defects in the                       polymers and enhance electrical conductivity. Oligomers will                    also be made in order to provide information about the effect                   of molecular structure on electronic and photonic properties                    and the likely environments needed for self-assembly in the                     related polymers. Molecular mechanics and band structure                        calculations will be used as a guide to polymer design.                         %%%                                                                             Synthesis of well-defined, homogeneously structured conducting                  polymers will provide materials with enhanced optical and                       electronic properties as well as provide low-defect materials                   which would address fundamental transport mechanisms in                         conducting polymers.",
