 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims at interpreting long- and medium-run productivity              dynamics in light of various realistic factor market imperfections.             In endogenous growth models, productivity dynamics are driven by                private optimal decisions to invest in physical capital or                      knowledge.  A lower income share for accumulated factors such as                physical capital and new knowledge implies lesser incentives to                 save rather than consume, and slower productivity growth if private             optimal investment decisions are the engine of growth.  Income                  shares may in turn be explained in light of imperfectly competitive             factor market interactions.                                                                                                                                     This research will seek interpretations for the post-1973 worldwide             productivity slowdown.  Non-accumulated production factors such as              natural resources and labor enjoyed higher shares of worldwide                  production in the 1970s.  This may be explained in terms of changes             in factor market structure, with a prominent role for insider power             in unionized labor markets and cartelization of natural resource                markets.",
