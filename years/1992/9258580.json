 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an NSF Young Investigator Award to Eric Beckman to                      enable him to explore modifications of polymer processes                        and/or products to reduce their adverse effects on the                          environment.                                                                                                                                                    For example, he will look at the production of bisphenol A                      polycarbonate.  Presently phosgene and bisphenol A disodium                     salt are reacted in an interfacial process, followed by a high                  temperature process that yields sodium chloride as a                            byproduct.  Large quantities of residual solvent must be                        eliminated from the product prior to further processing and                     the salt produced has to be landfilled as a hazardous waste.                    Dr. Beckman plans to explore a route to polycarbonate                           production which allows a milder environmental impact using                     supercritical carbon dioxide as both monomer and process                        solvent.  Carbon dioxide, nitrophenol, and a nitrophenoxy tin                   catalyst will be combined to produce nitrophenyl carbonate,                     which is then transreacted at mild temperatures to generate                     high molecular weight polycarbonate.  The nitrophenol produced                  during polymerization is then stripped from the polymer melt                    with carbon dioxide and recycled to the monomer production                      process.  This route would lessen the environmental impact of                   the polycarbonate synthesis by (1) eliminating the salt                         byproduct and chlorinated solvents, (2) reducing the energy                     requirement for polycarbonate production and (3) eliminating                    phosgene from the polymerization sequence.                                                                                                                      Another process that will be studied will involve the                           synthesis of polymers where improved recyclability is                           incorporated into the material at the molecular level.  The                     environmental impact of many short life-time packaging                          materials derives from their impact on the overall solid waste                  problem.  Current recycling technology permits a small                          fraction of the overall plastic waste stream to be recovered                    and re-processed.  Any thermoplastic material, if retained in                   a relatively pure form following use, can be reprocessed and                    thus recycled, therefore the recycling problem is in fact a                     separations problem.  The PI plans to generate polymers                         containing functional groups, which although hydrophobic, are                   readily reversibly transformed to hydrophilic groups in one                     synthetic step.  These materials could consequently be                          dissolved in water following chemical treatment, allowing both                  their extraction from bilayer or composite products, and                        subsequent recovery following reversal of the                                   functionalization reaction.",
