 "awd_abstract_narration": "Loeb will continue his work in applying nonstandard models                 to measure theory, potential theory, and stochastic processes.                  This approach uses measure spaces defined on nonstandard point                  sets.  These spaces make finite combinatorial methods available                 in research on infinite probability spaces.  Loeb will combine                  this measure theory with the theory of nonstandard hulls.  He                   also will continue his work on representing measures and ideal                  boundaries in potential theory.                                                      This research project is in the area of nonstandard                        analysis.  This subject arises from the attempt to develop the                  standard topics of analysis, including integration and                          differentiation, based on a nonstandard model for the real                      numbers.  In the nonstandard model, one has the notion of                       \"infinitely small\" numbers which formalize the intuitive notions                behind the concept of limit.  This formal construct often leads                 to greater combinatorial efficiency.",
