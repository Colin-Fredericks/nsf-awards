 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop formulations and                        solution strategies to generate the shape and topology of                       mechanical components that are optimal with respect to measures of              performance that include functional as well as geometric criteria.              The research will emphasize the following: mathematically                       rigorous formulations, which are posed formally as optimization                 problems in which the design space includes different topological               descriptions of the structure, as well as different structural                  idealizations of two and three dimensional components; optimization             problems that incorporate geometry and topology constraints;                    formulations that include local functional constraints on the                   mechanical behavior of the structure, such as measures of stress,               deformation, and buckling; and the development of computational                 procedures suitable for the solution of problems cast in the form               outlined above.                                                                 The investigation seeks to facilitate a systematic search in                    a space of design configurations that includes shape and topology.              The goal of such exploration is not only the generation of                      improved, optimal or near optimal designs, but also the generation              of  understanding of this complex design space and of the effect                that a meaningful class of design restrictions has on admissible                solutions to the design problem.  The investigation will produce                tools for design capable of suggesting near-optimal configurations              for a reasonably large class of mechanical design problems.  There              are many possible applications of these ideas in industries such                as automotive or aerospace.  These tools will, if successful,                   provide one of only a handful of methods that are applicable in the             early stages of design.",
