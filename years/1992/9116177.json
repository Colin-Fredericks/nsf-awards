 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will develop performance analysis tools and                   methodologies for congestion control protocols in computer                      networks.  The work includes a detailed study of a Fokker-Planck                system, developed by the principal investigator in previous work,               using finite difference schemes to solve the Fokker-Planck                      equations more efficiently and accurately.  The study will include              delayed feedback in the system, a detailed study of time series                 models of the Internet round trip delays.  It will also include an              investigation of statistical models correlating round trip delays               with network congestion, a mapping of the real world network                    parameters, and a comparison of alterative flow control protocols,              including both rate based window based algorithms.  The rate based              algorithms planned for this study are the Dynamic Time Window                   Protocol, dynamic version of the Leaky Bucket Protocol and the                  Packet Pair Protocol.  The switch schedules will be varied across               Fair Queueing, Virtual Clock, Generalized Virtual Clock.  Non-work-             conserving versions of Generalized Virtual Clock, FCFS Drop Tail                and FCFS Random Drop.",
