 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research program to investigate the dynamics of hole and electron             trapping and detrapping in oxide defects/traps at room temperature and          below will be conducted. Trapping behavior will be studied over a range         of electric fields and incident light intensities, and the research will        attempt to detemine whether charge free regions in gate insulators are          defect free or represent coalesced tunneling regions at oxide                   thicknesses <6 nm.  The study will also address the distribution and            density of defects/traps in insulators which have also been exposed to          ionizing radiation levels that might be encountered during device               processing.  The research is intended to resolve several outstanding            uncertainties in this field, and to provide insight into the physical           meaning of neutral defects with cross sections much smaller than an             atomic dimension.                                                               %%%                                                                             This research addresses basic processes in electronic materials, and is         expected to result in a better understanding of these processes, and an         improved ability to fabricate semiconductor devices and integrated              circuits with higher performance and greater reliability.",
