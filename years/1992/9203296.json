 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the problem of tracking time varying                   subspaces to model nonstationary vector time series.  A principal               objective is to characterize the tracking properties and steady                 state performance of the non-iterative Spherical Subspace (SS)                  tracker and associated Spherical Subspace Recursive Total Least                 Squares (SS-RTLS) adaptive filter.  This will be done using a                   statistical model derived from the general theory of stochastic                 recursive algorithms.  The non-iterative spherical updating concept             will be extended to develop an adaptive and non-iterative                       eigenstructure tracker.  Moreover, a generalized subspace tracking              method will be developed to optimally track the signal subspace in              the presence of colored noise.  Additionally, a matrix pencil                   tracking algorithm will be developed to reduce the computation                  associated with certain tracking problems.  These methods will be               applied to a vast data base of multichannel biomedical data                     consisting of synchronous electromyographic, kinematic,                         aerodynamic, and acoustic data in order to model the speech                     production process.  The biomedical work will be done in                        collaboration with an otolarynngology medical research team at the              University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.  Other               methods will be used to develop vocal tract signal analysis tools               that model and discriminate between different types of speech                   disorders.  The adaptive subspace algorithms will also be applied               to direction-of-arrival problems using data from a recently                     deployed experimental array of microphones.",
