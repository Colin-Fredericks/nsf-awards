 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are requesting that the Instrumentation Facilities                           Program of the National Science Foundation match funds made                     available by Washington State University for construction of                    a modern greenhouse and acquisition of  two environment                         controlled growth chambers.  These plant growth facilities                      are essential to alleviate the critical shortage of plant                       growth space available to the faculty of  the faculty of the                    Institute of  Biological Chemistry, a limitation which will                     be compounded by the addition of  two new faculty in the                        next three years.  Of the 6,240 sq. ft. of greenhouse space                     presently available to the 7 Institute researchers, more                        than 80% is on loan from other departments.  As discussed in                    detail in the proposal, research at the Institute includes                      studies on the regulation of terpeniod and  phenylpropanoid                     metabolism, regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism,                       structural elucidation and role of novel carbohydrates and                      peptides involved in plant signaling processes, structure-                      function relationships of stress induced and developmentally                    regulated genes that encode proteins involved in plant                          defense or of storage function, and the regulatory role of                      carbohydrates and lipids involved in cellular metabolism.                       These research programs, which are currently or have been                       supported by NSF, employ a diverse assortment of plants that                    demand specific environmental conditions for optimal growth                     and often require large amounts of these plant materials to                     be grown under controlled conditions.",
