 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continued improvements in integrated circuit (IC) performance,             circuit density, and production costs are possible as a result of               significant advances in VLSI and optical lithography.  The research             program, will capitalize on these developments and develop                      innovative and timely technology used in manufacturing                          semiconductor components, in particular the next generation of 16               Mbit and 64 Mbit DRAM chips.  This will be accomplished by                      utilizing new, deep UV excimer laser steppers and taking advantage              of powerful and cost effective advanced computer-aided design (CAD)             tools for simulation in the overall microelectronics                            product-developed process.   In the first phase of this project,                the manufacturing yield will be improved by modifying mask                      information based upon simulation and fabrication of structures                 using I-line wavelength verification.  Such a feedback process will             allow \"dynamic\" modification of the layout \"design rules\" in a VLSI             system design, resulting in improved manufacturing yield when                   compared with presently available \"static\" design rules.   A                    second, concurrent phase of the project seeks to implement and test             simulation models based on advanced KrF excimer laser sources                   needed for the development  of prototype 64 Mbit DRAM products.                 Interactive engineering tests will be performed at the university               and in industry to define the optimum operating range and control               methodology for excimer laser-based photolithographic light                     sources.                                                                             The work will allow the production of integrated circuits of               increased density, complexity and reliability.",
