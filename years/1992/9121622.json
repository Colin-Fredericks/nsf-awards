 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop a comprehensive                      assessment of the cost and effectiveness of competing greenhouse                gas policy initiatives applied to the electric power industry, an               industry already targeted as a primary participant in any                       solution to global warming.  Existing studies typically focus on                the aggregate U.S or global economies and have a demand-side                    orientation, evaluating how consumption patterns will change in                 response to regulation-induced price changes.  In contrast, this                project implements an applied macroeconomic model of firm                       behavior to assess how electric utilities would respond to                      alternative policy initiatives.  The model will be used to                      compare and contrast the critical properties of various policy                  options such as a carbon-content tax on fuels, a tax on the                     carbon-equivalent content of any emitted greenhouse gas, a                      command reduction in emissions, and a command reduction with                    allowed trading.                                                                                                                                                The econometric model and micro data set designed for this                      project will generate the following information for each policy                 imitative: the expected reductions in carbon dioxide, nitrous                   oxides, overall carbon-equivalent emissions, the marginal costs                 of reducing these emissions, the resulting impact on prices of                  electricity, and the coincident effects on both sulfur dioxide                  and ash emissions.  This information can be used to rank                        competing policy tools in terms of relative costs and                           effectiveness.",
