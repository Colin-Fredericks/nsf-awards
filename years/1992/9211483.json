They affect the campaign strategy and                    tactics adopted by political candidates, the marketing strategy                 and advertising campaigns of Fortunate 500 companies, the                       programming development and strategy in mass media, and strategic               planning and program development in public education.  In theory,               opinion polls provide a means for the public to feedback and                    shape institutions that govern their lives.  This research is                   based on the premise that this theory is incomplete and,                        consequently, decisions based on current attitude theory and                    surveys can be grossly (although nonobviously) misleading.                      Specifically, contemporary attitude theory and opinion polls are                based on the premise that people know and will report their                     evaluative dispositions toward attitude objects (e.g.,                          candidates, products, educational options).  However, there is                  now evidence from various disciplines that evaluative                           dispositions are represented and activated in more complex ways                 than accommodated by current theory and measures, and that                      contemporary bipolar (e.g., favor/oppose, like/dislike)                         self-report scales can potentially mask important differences in                people's evaluative dispositions.  A quantitative theory is                     proposed that subsumes existing attitude theory and research                    while calling attention to specific areas in which prior work can               be quite misleading.  A systematic program of research will                     contrast the predictions made by contemporary theory of attitudes               and the proposed theory of \"evaluative space.\"  For instance,                   individuals who have no attitude toward or feel neutrally about a               topic are indistinguishable using traditional opinion questions                 from individuals who are strongly conflicted about (e.i., who                   possess ambivalent attitudes toward) the topic.  Attitudinal                    ambivalence results when both positive and negative evaluative                  processes are coactivated and, as such, reflects a special case                 of behavioral conflict.  Research will investigate the                          determinants, mediation, and behavioral consequences of attitude                ambivalence and conflict, and will integrate this and traditional               attitude theory and research within the more general theoretical                framework of evaluative space.  In view of the ubiguity of                      evaluative processes in behavior, illumination of their dynamics                and the underlying evaluative mechanisms should have important                  ramifications for attitude theory and research, and broad                       significance for basic theory in psychology generally.",
