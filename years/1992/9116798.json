 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains the atomic structure of                    macromolecules. As of October 1991 there were 790 structural                    entries (196 Mbytes), if current growth rates persist, this                     number could grow to 10,000 by the end of the decade. The data                  provide opportunities for understanding biological function                     through, for example, comparative structural research.  This work               addresses several challenges in first making the PDB more                       accessible to molecular biologists and crystallographers in                     particular, and second assisting in the management of increasing                amounts of data. Several software developments are being                        undertaken in parallel, but share the same class libraries.                     First, a new object-based PDB storage format provides suitable                  access to the levels of substructure found in macromolecules.                   Second, object-based software tools that interrogate and                        manipulate structural data, and assist in structure verification                are being derived from existing structured programs. Finally, a                 high-level query language provides intuitive and direct                         interaction with the PDB. Each aspect of software development                   proceeds by prototyping followed by iterative cycles of testing                 in the laboratory and code modification. This work integrates the               state-of-art database research results such as object-oriented                  databases and knowledge bases, software engineering results such                as component and glue collaborative work such as extended                       transaction models to support cooperative scientific research.                  These tools could potentially precipitate the discovery of new                  structure-function relationships by permitting data query in a                  more intuitive fashion.",
