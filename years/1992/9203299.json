 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies several mathematical models for                   biological and chemical systems.  These include models for                      electrically excitable cells such as pancreatic beta-cells, and                 models for pattern formation on isothermal catalyst surfaces.                   Numerous models have been developed to test different hypothesis                for the biophysical mechanisms that underlie the electrical                     activity in these cells.  New analytic methods will be developed                to predict and classify the variety of different behaviors of                   solutions to these recent models.  Systems that model coupled                   beta-cells are also considered.  Very complex behaviors including               standing waves, rotating spirals, and chaotic dynamics have been                observed experimentally on catalyst surfaces.  Several models are               studied in order to understand the underlying mathematical                      mechanisms responsible for this rich structure of pattern                       formation.                                                                           Pancreatic beta-cells are responsible for the secretion of                 insulin.  This analysis will be used to determine the relative                  contributions of different ion currents to the beta-cell                        electrical activity.  It will help in understanding which of                    these currents are responsible for bursting activity in the                     cells, and which currents govern the duration of each burst.                    Moreover, this analysis will be used to identify glucose-sensing                mechanisms and determine the role of the electrical activity in                 stimulating insulin release.  This work contributes to                          fundamental understanding of pancreatic functions.  Topics on the               formation of surface patterns arise in connection with studies of               the behavior of catalysts.",
