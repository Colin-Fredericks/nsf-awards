 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is an investigation of processes of evolution in                planktonic foraminifera using stable isotopic analysis.  In the                 absence of obvious barriers to gene flow such as land masses (e.g.              Isthmus of Panama) or major oceanographic boundaries (e.g. Polar                Front and Tasman Front), how does evolution proceed in large                    pandemic populations in which gene flow is readily maintained over              great distances?  How do chronospecies gradually evolve within one              biographic province?  Most models predict that evolutionary change              in the deep-dwelling planktonic foraminifera occurs through                     segregation within the water column during times of well developed              depth stratification.  In broader terms, the globorotalid                       morphology is believed to have evolved iteratively in association               with adaptation to increasing water depths.  However, almost no                 data have been have been generated to test such hypotheses.                          We will isotopically analyze morphometrically-defined Late                 Miocene to Recent species of the Globoratalia (Globoconella) clade              in sedimentary sequences that form a meridional transect in the                 southwest Pacific.  A time-series strategy will be employed                     focusing upon those stratigraphic intervals in which there is                   overlap in the ranges of ancestor and descendant species.  Some of              the questions we will address include:  Do ancestor and descendant              species exhibit consistent differences in isotopic values,                      suggesting vertical or seasonal segregation in the water column?                 Are there isotopic trends within                                               this clade, suggesting progressive habitation of cooler or warmer               waters, either vertically or seasonally?  Are the isotopic trends               associated with paleoceanographic changes?  Are the isotopic trends             associated with specific morphological characters?  Do ancestor and             descendant species living in different water masses, some within                and some peripheral to the main biogeographic range of the clade,               exhibit similar differences in isotopic values and similar                      paleoceanographic and morphological associations?  How do the                   stable isotopic results from the Globorotalia (Globoconella) clade              compare with those from another deep-dwelling planktonic                        foraminiferal clade that, in part, exhibits similar morphologic                 characteristics: - the Globorotalia (Truncorotalia) clade?",
