 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New Mexico Comprehensive Regional Center for                                Minorities (NM-CRCM), is a statewide program for                                implementing a K-12 continum of enhanced science and                            math programs in the schools.  The NM-CRCM flagship                             programs, the Mathematics Engineering Science                                   Achievement (MESA) project, and the Community Academy                           for Science and Mathematics (CASM), are proven programs                         that directly address the NSF's CRCM goals and                                  objectives.  In addition, these programs include                                specific operational structures that maximize their                             potential to be sustained in the schools beyond NM-CRCM                         support.                                                                                                                                                        New Mexico has a number of other effective programs in                          science and math enhancement that direct collaborators                          in the NM-CRCM.  These programs enrich and are                                  integrated with the NM-CRCM science and math continuum.                         All collaborations include a true sharing of resources,                         trained personnel, and funding that ensures mutual                              benefit and integration.  All NM-CRCM collaborators have                        agreed to the NM-CRCM goals that are identified below.                                                                                                          During its prototype year, NM-CRCM has developed a                              statewide database of science and math progerams, K-16,                         that is available to students, teachers, and                                    administrators throughout New Mexico.  This databse now                         exists in hardcopy and will be disseminated through                             partnership with a New Mexico industry.  The database                           will eventually be placed on various computer bulletin                          boards so that schools or individuals with a modem may                          access the information.  The NM-CRCM will maintain the                          database, updating the hardcopy annually, and the                               database on a continual basis.                                                                                                                                  The project intends to bring its programs to at least                           80% of the rural school districts representing 35,000                           Native American and 40,000 Hispano ore-college students.",
