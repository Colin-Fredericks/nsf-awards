 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to integrate simulation,                 learning, and optimization to form an Adaptive and Interactive                  Modeling System (AIMS) to support multiple perspectives at                      different stages for design and concurrent engineering.  Given a                database of examples collected from simulations or experiments, and             a set of modeling objectives and design objectives, AIMS performs               multi-objective optimization at both model formation and                        utilization phases.  By varying modeling objectives, such as speed,             accuracy, and comprehensibility, AIMS can produce layered models                to meet the changing needs at different stages of design.                            By treating different life-cycle concerns as competing design              objectives, AIMS can support systematic incorporation of multiple               perspectives for concurrent engineering.  This research represents              a significant and meaningful integration between artificial                     intelligence based techniques and conventional engineering methods              to further advance the basic research in design automation.",
