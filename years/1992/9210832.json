 "awd_abstract_narration": "An understanding of the link between climate change and water              quality of surficial hydrologic systems requires reliable                       quantifiable estimates of past changes in effective moisture                    (precipitation-evaporation) and hydrochemistry.  The fossil record              of lacustrine ostracodes (Crustacea) from closed basin lakes                    located in the northern Great Plains will be used to develop                    quantitative estimates of effective moisture and solute histories.              The estimates will be obtained using a modern calibration data set              of paired ostracode and environmental data, and by applying                     recently developed multivariate statistical techniques in order to              obtain analogs of the fossil ostracode assemblages.                                  The estimates obtained from this study will be compared to                 estimates of salinity and effective moisture developed from                     independent data sets derived from the same lake cores and based                on diatoms and ostracode shell trace-elements and mineralogy.                   This Research Planning Grant is the first step in a larger research             effort to develop a new method for obtaining paleoclimatic and                  paleohydrologic reconstructions for the northern Great Plains that              can be used in GCM validation and for forecasting of climate-                   induced hydrologic changes.",
