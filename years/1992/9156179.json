 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department of UNCG and the Department of                            Mathematics and Computer Science of Bennett College are testing                 an integrated two semester introductory physics course for                      science majors.  The course serves either as preparation for,                   or as a replacement of the traditional survey course.  The                      project is a cooperative venture between a predominantly white                  state university of 11,000 and a private college of 600 African                 American women. The project is evaluating the effects of a                      decidedly different approach to the traditional two semester                    introductory physics course on women, minority and 'second                      tier' students.  The attraction of the students to the course,                  the knowledge of physics gained and retained during the course,                 and the retention rate of the students in the course are all                    being measured.  In addition, the future success in courses in                  the physical sciences and mathematics will be monitored. The                    tenet behind the proposed course comes from recent research in                  physics education, observations collected by the PIs over many                  years of teaching introductory courses, recent work done by the                 PI in Project PIEDMONT, documented evidence describing the low                  entry rate and high attrition rate of women and non-Asian                       minorities in physical sciences, and the demographic studies                    which profile the necessity of increasing the numbers of these                  populations in the areas of science, mathematics and                            engineering.  Students in the proposed course are examining                     fewer subject areas in greater depth than students in the usual                 survey course, and are doing so in ways which are pedagogically                 more sound and intellectually more exciting.  The four-credit                   hour per semester course is being taught entirely in a                          laboratory setting for two hours per day, three days a week.                    The students are developing a firm foundation of concrete                       experiences through a method of guided inquiry, and are being                   exposed to the use of modern data acquisition and analysis                      tools through a microcomputer based laboratory component.",
