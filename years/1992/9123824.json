Ab initio quantum mechanical methods are being used                 to determine the potential functions of the excited states of                   some model systems and then a system containing an intra-                       molecular hydrogen bond.  Reaction rates and deuterium isotope                  effects are being computed.                                                     %%%                                                                             Proton transfer reactions involved in many enzyme-catalyzed                     biological processes have been extensively investigated by both                 theoretical and experimental methods, but little is yet known                   regarding the nature of similar reactions between excited                       molecular states.  The potential energy surface of such excited                 states may differ radically from that of the ground state and                   quite different kinetic behavior may follow.  Such systems are                  being investigated in the current project.",
