Composite                    Construction II, a continuation of the 1987 conference, is                      organized to fulfill the intent of the 1987 resolution, and to                  again provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners form             around the world to meet and exchange vital information in this                 fast developing area of engineering practice.  The conference will              be limited to approximately 100 participants, with one-half of the              participants invited from abroad, and will cover all phases of                  design, construction and research related to composite steel-                   concrete structures.  Repair and strengthening of existing                      structures, as well as new construction will be discussed.                      Composite Construction II will provide an exciting opportunity for              an international exchange of ideas that will benefit the structural             engineering and construction fields both inside and outside of the              U.S.",
