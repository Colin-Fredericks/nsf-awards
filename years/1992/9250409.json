 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognizing the ever growing importance of computation and                      computer aids in engineering practice, Carnegie Mellon                          University's Department of Chemical Engineering is establishing                 an advanced computational laboratory for undergraduate                          education.  The laboratory is used as an instructional aid in                   the teaching of all of the basic courses, such as fluid                         mechanics, reactor design, and chemistry, through the graphics                  capability of each student station and one large common                         viewscreen in the front of the laboratory.  Undergraduates are                  exposed to the computational laboratory from the freshman                       through the senior years so as to continually develop their                     computer skills and become comfortable with computers for a                     variety of tasks including word processing, numerical analysis,                 spreadsheeting, and team (parallel) computation.  The                           uniqueness of this laboratory is the integration of computer                    methodologies into the learning process of students over their                  entire educational experience, so that each student will                        appreciate the range of computation from personal computers to                  workstation up to the supercomputer level, and know how and                     when to use each level.",
