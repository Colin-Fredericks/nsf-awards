 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inorganic membranes have the potential for high selectivity                     and the ability to operate at elevated temperatures and                         reactive atmospheres.  This makes these membranes suitable for                  applications outside the range of the well-established organic                  polymer membranes.  One application, for example, is in                         membrane reactors where an equilibrium-limited reaction such                    as hydrocarbon dehydrogenation is carried out with                              simultaneous hydrogen separation in order to increase the                       yield.  Zeolite membranes have the potential of highly                          selective separations for a variety of gas mixtures.  They can                  operate at ambient temperatures to carry out, at steady state,                  separations which are currently performed by unsteady pressure                  or temperature swing adsorption.  Or they can be used at                        elevated temperatures in catalytic membrane reactors to                         increase the reaction yield or selectivity.  To realize this                    potential, the zeolite membranes must be prepared as thin but                   mechanically stable layers supported on porous tubes or other                   support elements.                                                                                                                                               In this project, techniques for synthesizing thin zeolite                       layers within the walls of porous tubes will be investigated.                   The general approach is to deploy the reactants in such a way                   that conditions favorable to zeolite crystallization prevail                    only over a thin region inside the porous support.  Three                       specific techniques will be investigated for delimiting the                     crystallization region.  The first will be based on                             counterdiffusion of reactants between two aqueous solutions,                    the second on fixing the reaction front at the interface                        between an aqueous and an organic phase, and third on the                       localized precipitation of a precursor gel.  The formation of                   the zeolite will be ascertained by X-ray diffraction (XRD),                     solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared and                      physical adsorption, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM-                   EDX) will be used to define the location and thickness of the                   layer.  Permeation rate coefficients and separation factors                     will be measured for several gases at ambient and elevated                      temperatures.  Finally, the use of zeolite membranes as                         membrane reactors will be explored in a few catalytic                           reactions such as the dehydrogenation of isobutane and the                      alkylation of cumene.",
