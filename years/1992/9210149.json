 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells extend highly polarized processes, called dendrites and             axons, through which they communicate with each other.  Repeated                physiological stimulation of a neuron may result in long-term                   changes at the synapse, the site where connections are made.  A new             theory suggests that nerve cells may synthesize proteins close to               the synaptic site, depending on synaptic activity; the majority of              proteins in most cells is made by the protein synthetic machinery               in the cell body (the soma).  The goal of this research project is              to assess the extent to which neurons employ extrasomatic protein               synthesis.  Associate components of the protein synthetic machinery             will be identified in extrasomatic domains of neurons, and the                  accumulation of such components in those domains will be correlated             with physiological activity at the synapse.  Primary cultures of                neurons from both the central and the peripheral nervous system                 will be used in this approach.  In summary, this project seeks to               establish the functional significance of decentralized protein                  synthesis as a potential basis for long-term modulations of protein             repertoires in extrasomatic domains of nerve cells.",
