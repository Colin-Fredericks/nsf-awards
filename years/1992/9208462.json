 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sulfur gases are important components of the global cycle of S.                 They contribute to the acidity of precipitation and they influence              global radiation balance and climate.  The role of terrestrial                  sources of biogenic S and their effect on atmospheric chemistry                 remain as major unanswered questions in our understanding of the                natural S cycle.  Preliminary studies by these investigators                    suggest that vegetated areas of northern peatlands dominated by                 Sphagnum mosses emit large quantities of dimethyl sulfide (DMS)                 relative to other wetlands, and that changes in these wetlands                  during climatic changes could affect the high latitude atmospheric              S cycle.  This study will measure the rates of emission of DMS                  from wetlands to determine the importance of these habitats as                  sources of gaseous S, will address seasonal effects, the role of                hydrological changes in affecting DMS emissions, and the                        microbiological formation and consumption of DMS in wetlands.",
