 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many formal techniques for testing software have been                      proposed, but relatively little evidence has been gathered to                   indicate how effective these techniques are.  The goals of this                 research project are 1) to compare the fault-detecting ability                  of various previously developed testing techniques, including                   control flow based, data flow based, and mutation testing                       techniques, and 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of partial                     symbolic evaluation of path expressions (PSE), a heuristic                      technique that addresses certain semantic analysis issues                       arising in testing.  Fault-detecting ability of various test                    data adequacy criteria will be compared experimentally by                       generating large numbers of test sets for each of several                       subject programs, and measuring the proportion of adequate test                 sets (according to the various criteria) that expose faults.                    Fault-detecting ability will also be examined analytically by                   investigating conditions under which one criterion is guaranteed                to be better than another according to certain probabilistic                    measures.  Effectiveness of PSE will be investigated by                         measuring the proportion of cases in which the heuristic                        succeeds.",
