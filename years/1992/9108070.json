 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genes at the W and S1 loci encode a tyrosine kinase receptor                and its ligand, respectively.  W and S1 mutations cause defects in              development of primordial germ cells and later germ cells, as well              as of hematopoietic cells and melanocytes.  Dr. Bachvarova has                  shown that c-kit (encoded at the W locus) is expressed on the                   surface of oocytes from the stage of stored primordial oocytes                  through oocyte growth, meiotic maturation, and in development to                the 2-cell stage.  The principal aim here is to elucidate the role              of c-kit in oocyte growth, survival, development and/or adhesion.               Expression of ligand in the ovary will be examined by in situ                   hybridization, immunocytochemistry and functional assays.  These                results may elucidate what function is involved.  She will                      determine whether functional c-kit is present on oocytes using an               immunoprecipitation and autophosphorylation assay.  Using in vitro              culture systems, she will test whether addition of the ligand                   promotes aspects of oocyte development.  The effect of adding KL                to oocytes cultured under suboptimal conditions will be tested, as              well as the effect of culture on cell lines expressing transfected              or genetically mutated forms of KL.  Effects on oocytes growth,                 survival, and time to undergo meiotic maturation will be examined.              She will also determine whether added KL can induce the initiation              of oocyte growth in vitro.  Finally, she will determine whether                 blocking antibodies directed against either ligand or receptor can              inhibit these processes.",
