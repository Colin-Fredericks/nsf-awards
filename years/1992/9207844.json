 "awd_abstract_narration": "1/f noise appears in most high-technology                                       applications as a low-frequency fluctuation limiting                            the achievable performance and stability.  On the                               other hand, physical cross sections and process                                 rates have been shown theoretically by the author                               to fluctuate with a 1/f spectral density according to                           a universal formula which gives the power spectrum                              of fractional cross section fluctuations in terms of                            the fine structure constant a=1/137 if both the                                 velocity change of the scattered current carriers and                           their number are known.  We can now calculate                                   quantum 1/f noise in all forms of scattering                                    (impurity, phonon, umklapp, inter-valley), in bulk                              and surface recombination and tunneling rates, as                               well as emission processes.  For extended currents                              in larger devices with over 1013 carriers per unit                              length the magnetic energy dominates the kinetic                                energy of drift motion, so the coherent quantum 1/f                             effect becomes dominant.  The proposed research                                 would apply this theory to solid state devices and                              microstructures, and would further develop the                                  theory in the transition region between the                                     conventional and coherent domains.  We expect the                               proposed research to benefit high-tech applications                             through general and practical low 1/f noise design                              and optimization principles, and to improve the                                 general understanding of the quantum 1/f effect as                              quantum chaos, or as a technically important                                    fundamental law of nature.",
