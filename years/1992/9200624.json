 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at The                University of South Carolina to support ten undergraduate students              in a program called Summer Research Institute in Experimental                   Psychology.   The program provides a forum for educating                        undergraduate students about he field of experimental psychology.               The current appeal of applied psychology is drawing far more                    applicants to those programs, particularly among minority students.                                                                                             The Institute focuses student interest and enthusiasm on the basic              science areas of psychology.  The eight week USC Summer Research                Institute will permit well qualified minority and non-minority                  undergraduate students majoring in behavioral science, an                       experience in graduate level research including an opportunity to               formulate and conduct an experiment with individual guidance from               energetic and supportive research faculty.  The student will                    experience major phases of experimental research including                      literature review, hypothesis generation, data collection, data                 organization, statistical analysis, and writing a report in the                 style of the American Psychological Association.  Student                       experience will be enriched by weekly research seminars where                   assigned readings are discussed, and by-weekly sessions on problems             of research design and statistics in experimental psychology.                   Students receive gratis course credit for their work.  This program             emphasis is much needed, as the U.S. is perceived as the leader in              the field of experimental psychology, but our universities must be              able to motivate and train the best students for future careers in              the vital areas of behavioral science.  This Summer Institute                   provides one vehicle to enhance these goals.",
