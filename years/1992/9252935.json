 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this proposal, Michigan State University is requesting                funds to support the U.S. National Center for the Third                         International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).  In addition,              we are requesting support to conduct the United States curriculum               analysis and to do the international data analysis.                                  The TIMSS sponsored by the International Association for the               Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), will be the major                  international assessment activity during the 1990's.  The interest              which governments around the world have in assessing what is                    learned in school is a reflection of a global recognition that                  scientific literacy and economic productivity are inextricably                  linked, with mathematics at the forefront as the universal language             of modern technology (Walberg, 1983).  Assessment can play a                    critical part in the identification of needed reforms in education.             Thus far, 40-50 countries around the world are committed to                     participate in TIMSS.  The study will take place in 1993-94 and                 1997-98.  United States participation in TIMSS has been agreed to               at least in general terms as conveyed by the U.S. IEA General                   Assembly Representative Gordon Ambach and as endorsed by the                    National Academy of Science Board for International Comparative                 Studies in Education, by the National Science Foundation, and the               National Center for Education Statistics.                                            The activities involve three major tasks outlined below:                                                                                                        Administration and Supervision of U.S. Participation in TIMMS:             This includes all of the administrative and coordination activities             the National Center must perform to ensure that the U.S.                        participation in TIMSS is informed and shaped by the many                       contextual realities that affect U.S. mathematics and science                   education at all levels and is highly coordinated within the                    country.  The breadth of this task will require a staff of                      professionals to coordinate this responsibility and the people                  involved.  This task constitutes the major work for which this                  funding is being requested.                                                          Conduct of U.S. Curriculum Analysis for TIMSS:  The National               Center will undertake the U.S. curriculum analysis.  This will be               carried out in three phases:  definition of the sampling frame with             regard to the curricular materials in conjunction with the ICC,                 conduct of the analysis, and development of the U.S. report                          Conduct International Curriculum Data Analysis and Develop                 Report:  This will involve the development of a complex data file               and constructing of weights and procedures for analysis, detailed               data analysis to be completed at Michigan State University and                  development and dissemination of extensive monograph contrasting                countries with regard to science and mathematics curriculum.",
