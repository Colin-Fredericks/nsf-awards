 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal provides for the enhancement of 42 teachers (21                   selected each year) of grades 6-12.  The project provides for                   14 teacher teams composed of one secondary science teacher and                  two middle school teachers to study the applications of basic                   science (theories and concepts) in selected industries and                      societal agencies for translation through teacher generated                     modules into high school and middle school classrooms.  Two                     senior scientists, a Professor of Biology and a Professor of                    Chemistry are paired experienced science teachers and a                         teacher educator for two, three-week summer developmental                       workshops and academic year seminars.  The teachers will                        translate the curriculum generated in the summer curriculum                     development activities into clinics for high school and middle                  school teachers in their school districts during the school                     year. Science teaching skills will be enhanced through:  (1)                    vertically integrated science teams in the school system; (2)                   building teacher-generated curriculum by modifying outdated                     curriculum materials; and (3) implementation of greater                         attention to basic science in the middle grades prior to high                   school.  Some of the concepts and themes included in the                        workshops are DNA, enzymes, marine biology, energy, water                       cycle and quality, and the relationship of chemistry to our                     environment and daily lives.                                                                                                                                    Cost sharing is equivalent to 45% of the NSF award.",
