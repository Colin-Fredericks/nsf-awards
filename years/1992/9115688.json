 "awd_abstract_narration": "All organisms live in a fluid medium (either air or                        water), and are therefore subject to the physics of fluids.  In                 particular, all plants and animals encounter fluid-dynamic                      forces that can potentially injure or dislodge the organism,                    thereby adversely affecting its survival, and in many cases                     fluid-dynamic forces are thought to have acted as selective                     factors in the evolution of body form.  Aspects of these forces                 (e.g., drag on benthic organisms, lift on the wings of birds                    and insects) have been extensively studied, and our                             understanding of their mechanism has been an important tool in                  interpreting the ecology and evolution of these groups.                              Despite the importance of fluid-dynamic forces, one common                 force, near-wall lift, has escaped notice.  Near-wall lift is                   likely to be an important source of mortality in many benthic                   marine animals.  For instance, limpets and keyhole limpets are                  often killed when dislodge by hydrodynamic forces, and near-                    wall lift is by far the largest force acting on them.  However,                 the mechanism of near-wall lift and its interaction with body                   form have never ben examined and are not well understood.                            These investigations by Dr. Denny have three major goals:                  (1) To understand the mechanism of near-wall-lift and thereby                   to provide a firm basis for exploring its role as a source of                   mortality in limpets and keyhole limpets.  (2) To measure the                   strength distribution of limpets and keyhole limpets, thereby                   allowing for the quantitative prediction of rates of mortality                  as a function of the local wave regime. (3) To quantitatively                   predict the selective advantage or disadvantage in wall lift to                 act as an agent of selective mortality.  As such, this                          research provides a quantitative, experimental tool for                         exploring the role fluid-dynamic forces play at the crucial                     nexus of community ecology, population biology, and the                         evolution of body form.",
