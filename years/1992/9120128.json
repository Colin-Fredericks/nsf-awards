The main objective is to carry out                                              in-depth theoretical/numerical                                                  studies of aseismic hybrid control                                              systems for bridge structures.  In                                              particular, control algorithms will                                             be developed for various types of                                               hybrid control systems currently                                                being developed at PWRI.

Aseismic hybrid control systems are                                             often highly nonlinear (such as                                                 active sliding systems and variable                                             stiffness devices) inelastic, (such                                             as active rubber-bearing isolation                                              systems) or time-variant (such as                                               variable viscous dampers).                                                      Research efforts are needed to                                                  develop control algorithms which                                                could be incorporated into                                                      computer/processor and control                                                  hardware for aseismic hybrid                                                    control of bridge structures.                                                                                                                                   Theoretical studies will be carried                                             out at UCI, whereas hardware                                                    developments and experimental tests                                             will be conducted at PWRI.  Various                                             control algorithms developed at UCI                                             will be used in the experimental                                                tests.  Results of the experimental                                             tests obtained at PWRI will be                                                  correlated with the corresponding                                               theoretical/ numerical solutions                                                obtained at UCI.  Discrepancies                                                 between experimental and                                                        theoretical results will be                                                     examined, investigated and                                                      corrected.",
