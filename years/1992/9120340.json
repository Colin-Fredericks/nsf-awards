 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a renewal of research conducted under NSF                       Grant No. 89-13065, the objective of which was to develop                       and evaluate reliable methods for concentration and assay                       of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in wastewater.                        Results of work conducted under that award have led to                          formulation of the following objectives for the renewal                         period:  Determination of the survival of cell-associated                       HIV in wastewater after various stages of its treatment,                        improvement of concentration and assay procedures,                              development and evaluation of a device or procedure for                         concentration of the HIV in wastewater and field studies                        to isolate indigenous HIV in raw and treated wastewater.                                                                                                        The survival characteristics of the HIV under                                   environmental stresses have not been well-established.                          While there is no present indication that the                                   environmental media have any role in spreading the virus                        from infected to non-infected individuals, the virus has                        been shown to survive for significant periods of time in                        the environment.  The results of this research are                              expected to provide the basis for any changes, if any are                       found to be needed, in the engineering design of                                collection systems, treatment processes and systems for                         management of wastes that are infected with the HIV to be                       responsive to its survival and potential infectivity.",
