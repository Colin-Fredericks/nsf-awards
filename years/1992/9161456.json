 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research activity is designed to develop a non-invasive               technique for the monitoring of plasma reactors.  The basis for                 this approach is the phenomenon of Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF)             which can be used to conduct three-dimensional mapping of the                   plasma properties.  This will be analyzed to provide quantitative               information on constituent species, detection of appearance or                  disappearance of species and contaminants, and end point detection.             The technique will also develop innovative methods to perform rapid             scanning with a high degree of accuracy and sensitivity.  The                   technique can be used to provide reliable monitoring to enable                  process control of the dry plasma process.                                           The dry plasma process is widely used for the manufacturing                of semi-conductor devices.  The ability to implement closed loop                control will have significant impact on the yield and efficiency                of the process with large benefits to a vital industry segment.",
