 "awd_abstract_narration": "The status of the social sciences as sciences has always been                   precarious.  However, the central role played by statistical                    methods in the modern social sciences has seemed to provide at                  least several of them with a badge of scientific status, inasmuch               as a recurrent theme in the use of statistics in social inquiry has             been the idea that statistical methods should be capable of                     revealing distinctive laws and causal relations upon which the                  social world is ordered.  Yet today, the major methodological issue             confronting the social sciences is the emergence of a crisis over               the most widely used statistical methods, generally known as                    \"causal modeling\" techniques.                                                                                                                                   This conference, being held at Notre Dame University in October,                1993, is bringing together for the first time the major                         protagonists in the current debate about whether statistical                    methods can generate causal knowledge.  Also participating are                  sophisticated critics from philosophy and social sciences who are               exploring alternative interpretations of the crisis at the broadest             philosophical level.                                                                                                                                            The significance of the present situation is considerable, for the              \"natural science\" model of social scientific knowledge has had a                substantial impact on many areas of thought.  Its apparent                      dissolution from within is an event requiring philosophical                     interpretation.  This conference promises to assist in bringing                 these controversies out of the narrowly technical literature and                into the consciousness of the larger intellectual community.",
