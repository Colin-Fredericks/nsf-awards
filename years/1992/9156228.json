 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CUPLE Consortium has produced a prototype of new                            instructional resource for college and university physics                       courses.  CUPLE is comprehensive because it draws on innovative                 developments in classroom, laboratory, lecture demonstration,                   computational physics, videodiscs, and computer-based materials                 that have been developed by outstanding physics educators from                  all over the country.  It is unified because it combines these                  materials in a delivery system that is based on a hypertext                     multimedia environment that presents a consistent user                          interface to the students and faculty, eliminating the need for                 the user to learn the idiosyncrasies of many different systems.                                                                                                 The prototype system includes all of the tools necessary for                    the complete system, including data acquisition for                             microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL), student problem-solving                 through program construction (M.U.P.P.E.T. and WinPhys),                        integration of video into computer displays (including the                      ability to make measurements on screen), spreadsheet physics                    materials, and a hypermedia authoring system that pulls all of                  these tools together in an environment that allows faculty (or                  students) to develop new materials using these tools without                    the need to resort to sophisticated programming.  This project                  is extending that system to additional content areas, is                        enlarging class testing of the system at cooperating                            universities, is using the results of class testing and the                     ongoing technical beta testing to further refine the materials                  and tools.  The project is also developing the browser and                      class design tools necessary to allow faculty to design custom                  courses.",
