 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cottonmouth is one of several species of venomous (poisonous)               snakes in the United Sates.  Although they use their venom                      primarily to obtain food, it also serves as an important                        defensive weapon.  Dr. Hayes will investigate how cottonmouths                  use their venom when feeding, in particular whether or not they                 can control the quantities of venom they inject, and whether or                 not they inject more venom into larger prey.  Perhaps more                      important, we need to understand how snakes use their venom when                striking defensively.  Because many human snakebite victims are                 fortunate to have received \"dry\" bites, with no apparent                        injection of venom, it is widely held that snakes attempt to                    conserve their venom supplies when biting defensively.  However,                experimental data are lacking.  Thus, two experiments will be                   conducted to examine how cottonmouths use their venom when                      feeding on prey of different sizes and when striking defensively.                                                                                               From a biological perspective, this study should provide                        important insights into how the remarkable feeding and defensive                adaptation of venomous snakes have evolved.  It should also shed                light on the biological roles and evolution of snake venom.                     Defensive bites in particular are of medical significance to                    humans.  At present, physicians simply treat the symptoms of                    snakebite victims, with no knowledge of how much venom was                      injected.  This research may provide important baseline data and                techniques for future studies on how much venom snakes inject                   when biting humans.",
