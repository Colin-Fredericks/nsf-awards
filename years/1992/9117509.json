 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal eggs and embryos from a variety of organisms including                   mammals, amphibians and echinoderms exhibit extracellular                       matrices which play and important role in early development. In                 the sea urchin, sperm first contact a layer of egg jelly, which                 contains fucose sulfate-rich glycoconjugates (FSG) that induce                  the acrosome reaction. Acrosome reacted sperm proceed to bind to                receptors in the vitelline layer (VL), an extracellular coat, and               then fuse with the egg plasma membrane. Sperm fusion elicits                    cortical granule exocytosis which releases enzymes and structural               proteins that modify the VL to produce a chemically toughened                   fertilization envelope (FE). Exocytosis also results in                         polymerization of hyalin forming an extracellular coat                          responsible for adhesion of blastomeres in the early embryo.                    Finally, in a later secretory process the blastula secretes a                   basal lamina which lies at the interface between the blastocoel                 and embryonic epithelium. In this proposal Dr. Chandler aims to                 study the structure of egg jelly, its interaction with sperm, and               the conversion of the VL to the FE. To accomplish this he will                  prepare high resolution platinum replicas of eggs that have been                quick frozen at functionally distinct stages of early                           development, then freeze-fractured and deep etched. His aims are                1) to visualize by SEM and TEM of platinum replicas the structure               of whole egg jelly, 2) to fractionate egg jelly into constituent                glycoconjugates and to determine by rotary-shadowing the                        architecture of egg jelly macromolecules, 3) to localize FSG                    within whole egg jelly by immunocytochemistry, and 4) to                        characterize two assembly domains within the fertilization                      envelope as to their different complements of assembly enzymes                  and substrates. In addition, he intends to study the                            ultrastructure of the hyalin-based matrix at the apical surface                 and of the basal lamina at the basal surface of the blastular                   epithelium in regards to 1) secretion and assembly during normal                development as well as during reassociation of dissociated                      embryonic cells, and 2) immunocytochemical localization of                      vertebrate-like extracellular matrix proteins.",
