 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will analyse and design numerical methods                 for initial value problems whose solutions are required over long               time intervals.  Two classes of equations will be studied: those                possessing an absorbing set, where the long-time dynamics may be                extremely complex (chaotic) but remain in a bounded set; and with               those a gradient structure, so that solutions approach the set of               (typically multiple) steady states for large time.  For fixed                   time-stepping strategies, the proposed area of research is a                    generalisation of the classical theories of A, B and G stability.               These classical theories apply to classes of problems with simple               dynamics and it is of interest to determine how the theories can                be used and modified to cope with more complicated dynamical                    problems.  For variable time-stepping strategies some existing                  work on linear problems will be generalised to nonlinear                        problems. Work will also be directed towards the approximation of               homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, which play an important role                in the long-time dynamics of the two classes of equation under                  consideration.                                                                       Many phenomena of interest in the physical sciences and                    engineering require the understanding of dynamical phenomena that               evolve over very long time scales.  Examples include turbulence                 in fluids, phase separation in solids, and planetary motions.                   Often these phenomena are modelled by differential equations and                it is necessary to approximate these equations by computational                 techniques to obtain information about the underlying problem                   being modelled.  A question of fundamental importance is to                     ascertain the validity of the computer-generated output and, in                 particular, it is important to understand fully the relationship                between the computer-generated approximations of the model and                  the behavior of the model itself.  The study of this problem is                 well understood in many simple situations but these do not                      include situations where long time scales are present.  The                     object of the research is to study this problem, using the                      underlying theory of the differential equation models to guide                  the study of the computer-generated approximations.",
