 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of a series of three workshops to be                 held in successive summers for approximately twenty women                       researchers in statistics and probability who have received their               doctorate degree within the five years prior to the workshop                    year.  The first workshop is scheduled for August 8-9, 1992 and                 would immediately precede the Joint Annual Meetings of the                      American Statistical Association, regions of the Biometric                      Society, and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics to be held                from August 9-13, 1992 in Boston, Massachusetts.  The second                    workshop would likely be scheduled for August 7-8, 1993 and would               precede the Joint Annual Meetings of the American Statistical                   Association, regions of the Biometric Society, and the Institute                of Mathematical Statistics to be held from August 8-12, 1993 in                 San Francisco, California.  The third workshop is tentatively                   scheduled for August 1994 and would be held either prior to the                 Joint Annual Meetings of the American Statistical Association and               regions of the Biometric Society, tentatively planned to be held                in Toronto, Canada or prior to the Third World Congress to be                   held at a location in the U.S. yet to be announced.  The director               of the project is Professor Lynne Billard of the University of                  Georgia.                                                                             The purpose of the workshops will be to increase and foster                the research activity of the participants.  It is hoped that the                participants will use the workshop and the resulting professional               contacts to enhance their research and decrease their isolation.",
