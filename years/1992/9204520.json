 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is directed toward the operation of an array of              unattended, automatic magnetic data collection platforms on the                 Greenland ice cap and the reduction, distribution and analysis of               these data.  We propose to make the data from the MAGIC array,                  after reduction and verification, fully available to those who                  request it \u0131MAGIC = Magnetometer Arrary on the Greenland Ice Cap!.              The MAGIC array compliments the magnetic stations on the coast of               Greenland for the investigation of small-scale, ionospheric current             systems.  Operation of this array in the interior of Greenland                  takes advantage of the established logistical support for the                   Greenland Ice Sheet Program II (GISP II) at the Greenland summit.               Thus, it is possible to establish and maintain these stations for               a small cost.  These magnetic stations form a two-dimensional array             with station separation of about 150km.  The scientific objective               of these magnetic measurements is to investigate small-scale                    propagating magnetic disturbances which appear to result from                   moving filamentary field-aligned currents interacting with the                  ionosphere.  Different classes of these systems have now been                   identified and the origin of the field-aligned currents appears to              be the magnetospheric boundary layer and magnetopause region.  It               is particularly important to have a dense two-dimensional array in              order to resolve the motion and structural evolution of these                   current systems.  The MAGIC stations in combination with the                    existing west coast and east coast Greenland magnetometers and with             stations to be deployed in Canada, permit us to observe these                   phenomena over a sufficient region as to identify their generation              location and resolve their motion and spatial evolution as they                 propagate tailward.  Further the comparatively high time resolution             (15-s data) of the MAGIC and coastal stations will permit                       investigations which were limited by the one minute data previously             available.  This data and the proposed research is important to                 understanding the physics of the processes that couple energy and               momentum from the solar wind to the magnetosphere and ionosphere.               The proposed research is a collaborative effort between the                     University of Michigan, SRI International, and the Danish                       Meteorological Institute.",
