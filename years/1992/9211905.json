 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this research project is determination of                      reaction pathways for the oxidation of nitrogen-containing                      organic compounds.  The effects of products of hydrocarbon                      pyrolysis and oxidation on the reduction of NO will be                          examined.  These NO reduction experiments, to be carried out                    in an adiabatic flow reactor operating at 800-1000C, will be                    conducted with both pure organic nitrogen compounds and with                    these compounds diluted with hydrocarbons to yield a fuel                       feedstream with 2-10 percent nitrogen by weight.  The gas                       within the flow reactor will be sampled at various axial                        locations using a water-cooled quartz-lined sampling probe;                     these samples will be analyzed simultaneously using a gas                       chromatograph and an NO/NOx analyzer.  The effect of the                        carbon-nitrogen bond on formation of NO will be studied for                     complex nitrogen compounds such as quinoline, benzonitrile,                     and urethane.  The distribution of nitrogen intermediates from                  these complex nitrogen compounds will be measured.  The data                    will be analyzed to determine the significant reaction                          pathways using a quasi-global model of the hydrocarbon                          chemistry and a detailed model of the nitrogen chemistry.                                                                                                       An important output of this study will be evaluation of the                     feasibility of incinerating high concentrations of nitrogen                     compounds.  Many waste streams from the chemical, petroleum,                    and pharmaceutical industries contain such organic nitrogen                     compounds and present particularly difficult problems as                        regards environmentally safe disposal.  Reaction models                         developed as a result of these studies will be used in design,                  analysis, and evaluation of procedures for proper incineration                  of such waste streams.",
