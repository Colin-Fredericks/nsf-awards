 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this three year program is to provide teacher                    enhancement in the subject areas of Environmental and                           Behavioral Biology.  Each year, twenty-four junior high                         school and high school biology teachers will receive                            instruction at the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) of                          Michigan State University. Instruction will cover recent                        developments in environmental sustainability, agroecological                    practices, and the place of microbes in the environment.                        Lead teachers from previous workshops will be included as                       part of the teaching faculty.  Teams of middle school and                       high school teachers from the same district will be                             encouraged to apply.  The summer workshop can be applied                        toward a Masters of Biology Teaching Degree.                                                                                                                    Instruction will consist of lecture\\discussion, guest                           speakers, and appropriate laboratory and field experiences.                     In addition, participants will be shown ways of integrating                     economic, ethical, and political factors pertaining to                          environmental use into their curricula.  Teacher teams will                     develop laboratory or field experiences that will be shared                     with all other participants. Participants will be required                      to develop a Unit plan based upon a Conceptual Change Model.                    Based on their summer and classroom experience, participants                    will provide three days of inservice workshops to peer                          teachers.                                                                                                                                                       The total cost share of this program is 8.1% of NSF cost.",
