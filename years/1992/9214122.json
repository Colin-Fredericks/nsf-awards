The main objective of the workshop is to design an                     operational program for implementation of international                         university/industry cooperative research projects.  To achieve this             objective, pre-workshop site visits to locations of critical                    research activities in Egypt will be scheduled for the principal                investigators.  Drs. Magee and Abdel-Rahman will travel to Egypt in             the fall of 1992 to visit Suez Canal University, which will host                the workshop, and several industrial sites.                                                                                                                     This cooperative science activity in environmental engineering                  fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by             enabling leading experts in the United States and Egypt to combine              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of                   strong mutual interest and competence.",
