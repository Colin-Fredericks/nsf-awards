 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to extend the method of                            infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) to large                              new classes of discrete-event dynamic systems                                   (DEDS), and thus make it a practical tool for                                   analysis and control of DEDS.   The current                                     consensus of the research community is that IPA is                              an effective tool, but quite limited in the range of                            systems to which it can be applied.  For example, it                            is generally inapplicable to systems with multiple                              classes of customers or systems with finite-capacity                            buffers.  But these features are central in many                                applications.  Thus IPA is widely regarded as an                                interesting technique, but not practically useful.  We                          claim that this is incorrect and that IPA can be                                applied quite generally.  We have developed                                     theoretical support for this claim;  the purpose of                             this research is to translate this theory into a                                practical \"machinery\" for implementing IPA.  Our                                approach is based on constructing continuous                                    measure-changing mappings on the sample path                                    space using an appropriate representation                                       (construction) of the process.  A key element is that                           we require continuity only for the performance                                  measure of interest, rather than an entire class of                             performance measures.  This allows a substantial                                weakening of the existing conditions for the                                    applicability of IPA.  The success of this research                             will represent a breakthrough in the performance-                               oriented analysis and control of DEDS, and                                      contribute substantially toward practical success in                            this area.",
