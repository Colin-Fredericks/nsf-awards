 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are three parts to this study of economic growth and the                  level of economic aggregates.   The first part focuses on adverse               selection and aggregate employment.  Preliminary work by the                    investigator suggests that market participation will be                         inefficient in an economy in which it is costly to distinguish                  between low and high quality workers.  The project develops a                   general theory of market participation based on two different                   strands of theoretical research: imperfectly coordinated trading                and strategic complementarities in production.  The theory is                   extended to allow people to improve their jobs over time, to                    permit organizations such as firms to play a coordinating role,                 and to reflect different sectoral locations within markets.  The                importance of this inefficiency will be quantified and measured                 empirically.                                                                                                                                                    The second part develops a growth theory in which learning is the               engine of growth.  Information theory is used to derive the                     properties of the relationship between learning, technology and                 economic growth.  The third part explores the idea that a society               well-endowed with general skills will more easily take advantage                of new technologies by learning them faster.  Skilled labor will                concentrate on new technologies, a result consistent with                       arguments in the old-product cycle literature.",
