The areas of                      chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition                      include the following:  (1) computational research on the                       electronic structure of organic and organometallic molecules,                   (2) wave packet dynamics and surface scattering, (3) surface                    scattering and condensed matter simulations, (4) simulations of                 molecular fluids and biologically important molecules and                       quantum theory of highly excited states, and (5) quantum and                    semiclassical simulations of clusters and molecular dynamics                    simulations of sputtering from surfaces.                                                                                                                        %%%                                                                             The computational demands of modern chemical research require                   the proper computing system that would avoid wasteful                           bottlenecks by balancing a variety of computational                             capabilities with individual workstations, networks, hardware                   and software maintenance, support personnel and training in all                 areas of computational chemistry.  Many new insights into                       kinetics of chemical reactions can be developed through                         theoretical studies with use of mini supercomputers when the                    experimental data are inaccessible.",
