The               objectives of this program is to provide research support to the                Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and                       engineering faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the                    capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand               for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for                      academic and industrial research and teaching.                                                                                                                  This award will allow the investigator to pursue her research in                the area of financial economics.  She will continue and extend                  her work focusing share-holder behavior, risk taking, and stock                 value.  She will examine the inception and disagreement, the                    strategic manipulation of disagreement, and the effect of stock                 holder disagreement on firm decision making and the design of                   securities and corporations.  This general line of research will                provide a new understanding of the role of the firm, of investor                decision making and of securities and their markets.  It will                   also improve our ability to organize and regulate markets, to                   create financial innovation, and to understand the effects of tax               policy on investor and corporate behavior.",
