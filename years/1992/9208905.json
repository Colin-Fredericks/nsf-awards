 "awd_abstract_narration": "The insect cell-baculovirus system has received rapid and                       wide acceptance as a laboratory or small-scale system for                       production of proteins from recombinant DNA, and an \"AIDS                       vaccine\" produced by insect cell systems is in clinical                         trials.  This system offers advantages of safety, high                          productivity, generally reliable production of active                           proteins, and a high degree of post-translational                               processing.  Since the post-translational processing                            machinery of insect cells is not identical to that of                           mammalian cells, there may be some limitation on the types                      of proteins that are best produced in insect cell systems.                      However, products from insect cells typically elicit a                          strong immunogenic response, and this system appears                            particularly well-suited for use in vaccine production and                      possibly for antibodies.                                                                                                                                        In addition, the virus itself may be                                            genetically-engineered to improve its properties as a                           safe, specific, and effective insecticide against major                         crop pests and forest insect pests.  One of the Principal                       Investigators (PIs) has conducted the first tests in this                       country of a field released genetically-engineered virus.                                                                                                       The overall objective of this project is the development                        of a basis for predictable large-scale production of                            proteins and insecticides using insect cell lines.  For                         either production of proteins or viral pesticides, more                         efficient production systems will be required.  Because                         these products may be required in large volumes, and are                        likely to be cost-sensitive (e.g. animal vaccines and                           bioinsecticides), the success of the system will be                             strongly dependent on improved and novel engineering                            design.",
