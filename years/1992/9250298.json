 "awd_abstract_narration": "A coordinated set of laboratory core exercises will take upper                  division cell and molecular biology majors from the cloning of                  a gene to the purification of its coded protein.  The exercises                 is based on the baculovirus (Bac) expression system, a                          procedure that inserts foreign genes into a virus which infects                 cell lines derived from moths and over produces the inserted                    gene.  The laboratory exercises will flow from the subcloning                   of genes into transfer vectors used with the Bac system to the                  chromatographic purification of the recombinant protein                         produced in the tissue cultured moth cells.  The DNA to RNA to                  protein principle of molecular biology is reinforced by the                     working relationship students receive with such important                       procedures as: tissue culture, manipulation of viruses of                       eukaryotic cells, in vitro manipulations of DNA molecules,                      specific detections of macromolecules (Western, Northern, and                   Southern blots), and protein purifications.  Senior Thesis                      projects will aslo employ the new laboratory equipment.",
