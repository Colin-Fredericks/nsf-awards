An integrated series of \"magnet' courses                   for undergraduates is being created that consists of freshman                   seminars, which will broaden opportunities for the non-major                    and major alike, and a new one-semester introductory course                     based on case studies, which will provide a more interactive                    entry into science.  Graduate and undergraduate students are                    participating in the development of both types of courses and                   testing their efficacy, and the effort is being evaluated by an                 outside consultant.  The new comprehensive program will serve                   as an important model for the further development of the entire                 science curriculum, both for the non-major and major.",
