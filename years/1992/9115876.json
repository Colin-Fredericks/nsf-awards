 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the hypothesis that recruitment pulses to                 rocky intertidal barnacle populations are caused by the collision               of upwelling fronts with the rocky intertidal zone.  A front                    separates the relatively cold and salty upwelled water nearshore                from the relatively warm and fresh water further offshore.  It is               hypothesized that the upwelling front is a place of convergence,                and that larvae of intertidal barnacles accumulate there.  At                   certain times such fronts appear to collide with the shore and to               deposit their accumulated larvae on the rocky intertidal zone,                  thereby producing a recruitment peak.                                                                                                                           To test this hypothesis, knowledge of the temporal history of the               position and vertical structure of an upwelling front is required,              contemporaneously with knowledge of the distribution and abundance              of larvae in the water column and their recruitment success.  This              will be achieved through use of satellite AVHRR data, shipboard net             tows and temperature, salinity, and velocity measurements, moored               and shore-based measurements of temperature and wind, and benthic               monitoring in the intertidal zone.                                                                                                                              This research is significant in increasing our understanding of                 recruitment and of cross-shelf transport, and in developing                     predictive models for the dynamics of coastal populations with                  pelagic larvae.",
