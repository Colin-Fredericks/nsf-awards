 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists are increasingly realizing that patterns of                     storage and processing of energy and chemical elements in                       ecosystems are strongly influenced by the composition of the                    ecological communities present in the ecosystem.  In lakes, the                 abundance of \"top predators\" (i.e. fish-eating fish species like                bass) can have strong effects on all levels of the system,                      including the abundance and productivity of plant producers and                 the cycling of chemical elements.  This occurs because predatory                fish consume plankton-feeding fish, like minnows, which in turn                 influence herbivorous consumers (zooplankton).  Finally,                        zooplankton both regulate the abundance of plant producers                      (phytoplankton) and decomposers (bacteria) and recycle                          nutrients.  This project focusses on the effects of food web                    structure on the relative availability of nutrient elements                     critical for microbial growth (nitrogen and phosphorus).  It                    tests the predictions of a recently-developed,                                  physiologically-based theory designed to understand how different               zooplankton species regenerate nitrogen and phosphorus present in               their food.  By altering the dynamics of these herbivorous                      zooplankton, fish predation can therefore influence the cycling                 of nitrogen and phosphorus.  Based at the Experimental Lakes Area               in Canada, the main research approaches will in involve                         experimental manipulations of nutrients and zooplankton in large                enclosures in lakes as well as whole-lake manipulations of                      food-web structure (via introduction of pike to two lakes which                 lack such a fish-eating species).  THese studies have direct                    application to understanding the processes controlling elemental                cycling in ecosystems; such processes play a critical role in                   various areas of direct societal, including global climate                      change, the dynamics of contaminants in the environment, and                    degradation of water supplies.",
