 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data for an analysis of pastoral population dynamics from                 more than two years of field research (anecological) on the                     Karimojong of Uganda will be analyzed and prepared for                          publication, as part of a long-term research project.  The study                group is a major social and territorial division (Ngisonyoka) of the            quarter million Turkana, nomadic livestock herders in northwestern              Kenya.  The sample, which totals about 10,000 individuals, is                   based on descent.  The data will be organized into 62 master files              (all the interview information for each descent-set) and 62 analysis            files (only the information amenable to quantitative analysis).  The            latter will be coded and aggregated into a single PARADOX file.                 This program will be used to ascertain changes through time in                  birth rates, mortality, and frequencies of in- and out-migration, and           in the sex and age distributions of the pastoral population; to                 determine the frequency distribution by age, sex, cause, and year               of post-infant mortality; to improve estimates of female fertility; and         to determine variations in both male and female fertility and                   reproductive success.  The database can be used to model                        population dynamics over a 50-year period, because it provides                  quantitative information about changes through time in all four                 population parameters--birth rates, mortality, in-migration and out-            migration.  Pastoralism, an adaptive strategy used by tens of                   millions of people, allows human use of land where low                          precipitation precludes reliable agriculture.  Human ingenuity,                 together with environmental variability, leads to a range of pastoral           strategies which are variably successful.  At their core are the                inter-related dynamics of human and livestock populations.                            This effort is part of the South Turkana Ecosystem Project,               a long-term, multi-disciplinary study which attempts to apply the               research standards established by evolutionary biologists,                      ethologists, and ecologists in a study of the ecology and behavior              of a pastoral population.  By providing information on social and               personal as well as environmental factors which affect population               parameters, this study also will allow predictions about the effects            of social and environmental changes, and enable people to devise                humane and ecologically wise development policies.                                    The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                    opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    lecturing/teaching anthropology classes, participating in a seminar             series, working with persons from different departments through                 the Populations Issues Research Center, and involving both                      undergraduate and graduate students in research through the                     study's data analysis.",
