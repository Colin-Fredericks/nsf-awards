(1)  The attitudes of program                           participants and school personnel about each other and how have                 those attitudes changed through participation in the nontradition               or mid-career program.  (2)  The organizational changes sustained               in the process of establishing a nontraditional or mid-career                   program.  (3)  How the supply pressures and the development of                  responsive program affected the larger political and social                     context in which policies and processes for teacher training are                established.  Outcomes of this study will include: (a) a set of                 case studies describing the programs both qualitatively; (b)                    guidelines to support the relationship between the private sector               and education; (c) an annotated guide to resources and programs.                The private sector partner in this project will be Digital                      Equipment Corporation which will not only provide hardware and                  software but also professional staff expertise in research                      design, analysis, and reporting.",
