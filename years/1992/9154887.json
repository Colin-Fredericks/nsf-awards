Eight participants will be placed in on-going research laboratories             on projects leading to specific research goals.  The laboratory                 experience will mimic today's real world, research and development              as a joint effort and teamwork.  There will be three different                  participating laboratories in each of the Colleges of Agriculture,              Earth and Mineral Sciences, and Science.  Collaborating engineering             faculty and graduate students will participate in each laboratory.              To encourage interaction between participants, the composition of               the groups for other planned activities will be different from that             of the research-team groups and different from each other.  These               activities include:  communication skills, research methodology,                envisioning quantitative information, library techniques, research              talks, career panels, career mentoring by graduate students, open               house at the four colleges involved, science teaching as a career,              career counseling, gender issues discussion, science and                        engineering course requirements and descriptions, the social                    context of technology, and an all-day research retreat.",
