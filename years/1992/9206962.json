 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent discoveries of gold and platinum group (PGE) mineralization              in Eocene layered gabbros of East Greenland demonstrate that                    physical and chemical processes associated with the transition from             continental to oceanic rifting can concentrate precious metals in               the Earth's crust.  One of these gabbros, the Kap Edvard Holm                   Complex, exhibits an unusual combination of features related to                 stratiform precious metal mineralization.  An understanding of                  these processes requires detailed field, petrologic, isotopic, and              chemical analyses, combined with theoretical analysis of the                    thermodynamic and transport characteristics of magma-hydrothermal               systems.  The long-term plans for this research program inviove                 using these techniques to provide new insights into the nature of               processes controlling:  1) precious metal concentration during                  gabbro crystallization; and 2) precious metal transport and                     deposition in gabbro-hosted hydrothermal systems.  A specific                   objective of the research will be evaluation of various hypotheses              that may explain the unusually high ratio of precious metal to                  sulfide that is characteristic of this deposit.  Investigation of               the processes responsible for mineralization in the East Greenland              gabbros is potentially of great importance to understanding the                 global distribution of precious metals and to formulating future                mineral exploration strategies.  The present award will enable him              to get started while he is formulating a plan to achieve the                    long-term goals.",
