 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will track participation in the nomination and               general elections of 1992 in order to study the relationship                    between involvement in presidential nomination campaigns and                    participation in the general election.  The researchers are                     concerned with participation in the fall presidential campaign, in              campaigns for other offices, and in the party organizations.  In                addition, they will focus upon identifying and tracking patterns                of change in the party system.  They contend that presidential                  nominations are important avenues for recruiting activists into                 campaign and party activity.  This is an underappreciated                       consequence of contemporary nomination campaigns, and it is one                 that this investigation is uniquely designed to address.                                                                                                        As a renewal investigation, the researchers will continue the long-             term tracking of presidential nomination participants they began                with in the 1980 election.  They recontact their panel of state                 convention delegates, which reaches back to the 1980 nomination                 campaign.  The researchers also continue their 5-wave panel of                  caucus attenders begun in 1984, and recontact the bulk of their                 1988 cross-section samples from the 1988 campaign.  In addition,                the researchers draw new cross-sections of caucus attenders from                the 1992 nomination campaign.  All samples involve both Democrats               and Republicans, and all of their contacts in this phase of the                 study will be made immediately following the 1992 fall election.                                                                                                This study promises to substantially enhance our understanding of               the role that nomination campaigns play in recruiting activists                 into campaign and political party activity.",
