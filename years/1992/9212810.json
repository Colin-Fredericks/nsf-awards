Steele, Dissertation Student; Topic:  \"Ballistics and                  Military Change.\"                                                                                                                                               The incorporation of scientific knowledge into the practice of war              has become an increasingly important topic.  In the 1960's,                     laboratories and research centers at universities were bombed by                anti-Vietnam protestors.  Even now, many universities are chary of              having defense-related research programs on their campuses.  Yet                this wariness of academic science to be actively involved in                    military research (and its counterpart, the traditional wariness of             the military to adopt quickly the fruits of science and                         engineering) is not new.  In Renaissance Europe, it is said that                Niccolo Tartaglia called for a moratorium on the study of                       ballistics research.  Shortly after this call, however, the Moors               were threatening the gates of Vienna and Western Europe was                     threatened with being overrun.  Tartaglia switched positions and                worked to use his scientific acumen to advance the theory of                    ballistics--he is the one who discovered the law that projectiles               fly farthest (in a vacuum) if shot at a 45 degree angle.                                                                                                        While much progress was made in the theory of ballistics during the             Renaissance, the crudity of the weapons made the theoretical                    discussions somewhat superfluous.  Mr. Steele, in his dissertation,             is examining the period when the scientific study of ballistics                 began to make a real difference.  His dissertation has two goals:               to provide a more thorough investigation of historical publications             on ballistics, and to investigate the relationship between this                 science and military developments.  More specifically, Mr. Steele               is documenting the relationship between the revolution in                       ballistics launched by Benjamin Robins and Leonard Euler and the                transformation of artillery shortly thereafter.  It was in this                 period, according to Mr. Steele, that ongoing ballistics research               significantly improved gunnery or artillery \"software.\"  This                   research will also shed light on an historically significant yet                generally ignored side of classical mechanics, namely the study of              motion in resisting media.  The resulting dissertation will connect             significant scientific and military activities that are currently               disconnected in history, integrating experimental and mathematical              research into a broad political framework.",
