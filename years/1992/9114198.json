Participants will discuss and exchange recent experimental                      results on such topical areas as isotope effects in plant                       processes, environmental effects on carbon isotope discrimination               and water-use efficiency, genotypic differences in water-use                    efficiency and interpreting plant hydrogen and oxygen isotopic                  composition.  Seminar co-organizers are Dr. James Ehleringer of                 the University of Utah and Dr. Graham Farquhar of the Australian                National University in Canberra.  The seminar will take place                   during the first half of 1992 in Riverside, California.  Local                  arrangements are being coordinated by staff of the University of                California, Riverside, and is held under the auspices of the                    U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program.                                                                                                                     The applications of stable isotope technologies to the plant                    sciences in recent years have had a significant impact on                       increasing the understanding of plant gas exchange, water                       relations, and photosynthesis from genetics levels through                      ecosystem levels, and across such fields of study and application               as agriculture, forestry and ecology.  Much of this research has                been driven by U.S. and Australian scientists.  This seminar will               provide an opportunity for the exchange of information and ideas                on the topic subject, and will promote possible future joint                    research projects.",
