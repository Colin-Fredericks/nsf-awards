The                                  project continues their recent efforts to build a                               modern facility, support research and research                                  training, and provide means to meet their science                               equipment needs into the next century for their                                 small, quality doctoral chemistry research program                              which has just received a $400,000 grant from the                               U.S. Department of Education to assist it to                                    expand its graduate student numbers by 50%, with                                particular attention to the recruitment of women                                and minorities.                                                                      The project includes complete removal and                                  replacement of the fume hoods and associated duct                               work in Jeppson Laboratory; renovation of the HVAC                              system to accommodate the new air flows; and                                    upgrades and reconfiguration of several research                                laboratories to adapt them to the current needs of                              the chemistry faculty and accommodate the                                       increased number of research students.  The                                     laboratory renovations, although minor in scope,                                will greatly enhance productivity and safety, and                               will allow the full utilization of existing space                               that will be required to accommodate the increased                              numbers of researchers associated with the Ph.D.                                program expansion.",
