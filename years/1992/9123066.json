 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although many researchers propose that the balance between                 costs of plant defenses and the cost of herbivory have influenced               both the types of defenses a plant employs and the distribution of              those defenses among plant structure, no study to date has fully                evaluated these costs in a quantitative fashion nor has anyone                  determined how these costs are affected by the plant's access to                light and other resources.  To address this question, the                       relationship between costs of extrafloral nectar production in two              closely related Passiflora species that differ in the range of                  light conditions in which they grow will be studied.  The proposed              project provides several advantages over previous approaches to the             study of costs and benefits of defense.  Extrafloral nectar, unlike             many toxic chemical defenses, has a simple chemical composition and             can be measured in a non-destructive fashion.  Further, protection              associated with extrafloral nectar production can be evaluated by               comparing untreated plants to plants from which ants have been                  excluded.  Finally, by using population projection matrices to                  model plant growth, the costs of defense and herbivory can be                   expressed in terms of a fitness component.  Thus, extrafloral                   nectar-based ant defense may represent an ideal system for the                  study of costs and benefits of leaf defense.",
