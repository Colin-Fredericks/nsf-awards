 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research will be to use directed hydrogen                     bonding interactions to control the size and shape of                           self-assembling organic structures in both solution and in the                  solid state.  The first goal of thew work is to understand the                  structural features necessary for the self-organization of                      different cyclic and linear hydrogen bonded aggregates, some                    unsubstituted and some with photoactive functionality attached.                 The second goal is to understand the energetics of                              self-assembly and the balance between the favorable enthalpy                    and unfavorable entropy of aggregate formation.                                 %%%                                                                             With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                    the research of Dr. Andrew D. Hamilton of the Department of                     Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh.  Professor Hamilton                  will focus his work on the design, synthesis and evaluation of                  self-assembling organic structures.",
