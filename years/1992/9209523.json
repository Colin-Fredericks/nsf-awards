 "awd_abstract_narration": "Potassium channels are one of the main groups of intrinsic membrane             proteins which are fundamental for the generation and coding of                 signals in the nervous system to convert environmental information              into a language understood by the brain.  The brain carries out a               variety of distinct functions and, as such, requires a large number             of coding mechanisms.  To provide for this the nervous system has               developed a variety of potassium channels, each type with specific              structural and biophysical properties related to its function.  To              analyze this diversity, genes that give rise to the large                       structural diversity of these channels are being identified and                 isolated to be reinserted into simple model systems, i.e., oocytes              (egg) of the frog, where they can be isolated and studied in the                absence of the complex functions of the intact nervous system which             normally complicates their study.  This project explores the                    structure and function of one type potassium channel that has been              identified in higher animals and humans but whose function is not               known.",
