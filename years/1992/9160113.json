 "awd_abstract_narration": "Superconductivity is a phenomenon that has had tremendous                  publicity over the last few years.  The practical application of                high temperature oxide superconducting materials is in the early                stages of development.  For these oxide materials to be applied,                there must be a manufacturing process that allows the production                of long, continuous, uniform wires and strips.  This research will              explore a unique tubular wire manufacturing process that can allow              the production of unlimited length superconducting wires.  This                 unique manufacturing process is intended to overcome the problems               with the conventional manufacturing method of packing a powder in               a fixed-length hollow tube, and can be applied to any                           superconducting powder and sheath material combination.  This                   process will be researched using the Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O powder and                Silver Sheath.  The consistency and the uniformity of                           superconducting wires will be evaluated.                                             The results of this research will greatly accelerate the use               of high temperature superconductors because long uniform                        superconducting wires will be available for the manufacture of                  magnets, motors, generators, and magnetic resonance imaging                     equipment.",
