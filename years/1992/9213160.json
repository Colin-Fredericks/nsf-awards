 "awd_abstract_narration": "Models of relaxing derived from studies on skinned fibers and                   isolated proteins must ultimately be tested on intact muscle. The               aim of this proposal is to measure relationships among events                   connected with reciprocal regulation by (i) Ca2+int and (ii) cross-             bridges. The fraction of attached bridges lags behind the fall in               Ca2+int and relaxation in intact cells. Cross-bridge attachment itself          may slow relaxation (Weber and Murray, 1973). Quick length changes              cause the appearance of extra Ca2+int in cardiac and barnacle muscle            (Ridgeway and Gordon, 1984), but not in vertebrate skeletal muscle              (Fuchs and Wang, 1991). Quick length changes will be applied to                 aequorin-injected frog skeletal muscle to probe the relations among             (i) Ca2+int, (ii) rate of relaxation, (iii) stiffness, (iv) filament            overlap, and (v) degree of activation (Cecchi et al., 1986) The                 results will refine the concept that mechanisms underlying g muscle             relaxation are perceivably of more than one kind. The physiological             importance of dual regulatory mechanisms will be determined  and                the relative contribution of Ca2+int and cross-bridges in reciprocal            regulation will be defined.",
