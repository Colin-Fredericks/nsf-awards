 "awd_abstract_narration": "Male reproductive function is under the control of a region of the              brain called the medial preoptic area. Within that area several                 neurotransmitters and their interactions modulate that function.                In this award, Dr. Elaine Hull will study the effects of direct                 injections of neurotransmitter substances into the medial preoptic              area as well as the endogenous levels of these substances in the                same region. The technique used to collect fluid bathing the brain              tissue is microdialysis and the technique used to measure the                   levels of the neurotransmitters is high performance liquid                      chromatography. Both of these techniques are very sensitive to the              small amounts of neurotransmitters that are normally present within             brain tissue. Behavioral observations will be made in order to                  determine which neurotransmitters are released during reproductive              behavior. The neurotransmitters studied will be serotonin,                      dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. This will provide                        information about the biochemical messages that control                         reproductive function. The knowledge gained in these studies will               contribute to understanding how the brain controls complex                      functions, such as reproduction.",
