J.                            Armesto and M. K. Arroyo-Hurley of the Universidad                              de Chile in Santiago, Chile.  The collaborators                                 intend to quantify the effects of forest                                        fragmentation on mutualistic animals and on the                                 reproduction of their plant mutualists, and to                                  examine the effect of perches on rates of                                       recruitment of fleshy-fruited plants on disturbed                               sites.                                                                                                                                                          Mutualistic interactions between plants and animals                             comprise a set of major ecological processes in many                            terrestrial communities, although they are much less                            studied than competition, predation, parasitism, and                            herbivory.  Because their effects are positive, the                             continued operation of these mutualisms is critical                             to maintenance of ecosystems and community function.                            The proposed work will involve a field census of                                birds, student training, and setting up a                                       colonization experiment.  These studies will prove                              useful in carrying our similar studies in the north-                            temperate rain forests from the Pacific part of                                 North America, where communities and interactions                               may be organized differently.",
