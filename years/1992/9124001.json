This project involves four to eight undergraduate engineering                   students in the identification of promising sources of ethical                  questions and problems that can provide the basis for a                         curriculum                                                                      in engineering ethics for graduate students.  Under the                         supervision                                                                     of the principal investigator, in association with a group of                   collaborating faculty, the students will gather information about                                                                                               current dissertation topics that are promising sources.  They                   will                                                                            meet with the faculty and students working on these topics to                   obtain information about how the ethical issues are being                       handled.                                                                        They will also consider ethical issues that arise in engineering                                                                                                more generally.  As the results from their research and                         interviews                                                                      are developed, they will be incorporated and tested in a graduate                                                                                               course in engineering ethics to be taught at MIT in the spring.                                                                                                 Research will continue over the summer and fall, to identify new                                                                                                issues and examine those previously identified more deeply.                     Results will be incorporated into graduate engineering as well as                                                                                               other programs at MIT, and be reported on widely at meetings and                                                                                                in engineering publications.                                                                                                                                    This proposal focuses on an important area in Ethics and Values                 Studies.  The investigators are very well qualified; the plan is                                                                                                thoughtful and feasible; university support is good.  Results are                                                                                               likely to improve the teaching of engineering ethics on this                    campus                                                                          and in graduate curricula nationwide.  Support is highly                        recommended.",
