 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eocene-Oligocene transition (about 42 to 30 million years              ago) was the most significant episode of climatic change and mass               extinction since the demise of the dinosaurs.  The extinctions                  during this transition have been attributed to many causes,                     including meteorite or cometary impacts, volcanism, and climatic                cooling due to Antarctic glaciation and oceanographic changes.                  Recent research has shown that the most dramatic changes occur                  between the  middle and late Eocene.  The Trans-Pecos region of                 Texas is the only place in North America where this change is                   recorded by superposed mammalian faunas datable by both                         radiometrics and magnetostratigraphy.  There is no place in North               American the contains interfingering marine/non-marine sequence of              this age, so this area is the key to unlocking the details of the               Uintan-Duchesnean-Chadronian transition in land mammals.                             The Trans-Pecos rocks contain a number of well studied faunas              of middle Eocene (Uintan) and late Eocene (Duchesnean and                       Chadronian) age.  Although preliminary paleomagnetic studies have               been on some these rocks, many of the key fossil localities, and                most of the Uintan and Chadronian parts of the section, have never              been sampled.  This project will collect and analyzed paleomagnetic             samples from most of the key localities, and provide new 40Ar/39Ar              dates to improve the geochronology.  It will then be possible to                correlate Uintan, Duchesnean, and Chadronian faunas from all over               western North America to the magnetic polarity timescale.  Episodes             of extinction and faunal change can then be examined in greater                 detail, and correlated more precisely with the global record of                 climatic and biotic change during the Eocene-Oligocene transition.",
