 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the organization of technological                       inventive activity within and across national boundaries and of                 the participation of the United States and other countries.                     Inventive activity is an intellectual tradition which is                        cultivated in most societies.  Inventors, their laboratories or                 firms, and nations compete with each others in inventive                        activity, but they often also cooperate with others.  One goal is               to describe the dispersion of inventive activity (in the form of                patents, for example) across the world.  Another goal is to                     examine the position of the United States and to compare it to                  other centers of inventive activity (Japan and Western Europe).                      The study will enhance our understanding of the patterns and               dynamics of technological development and its links with science                and the economic in national and international contexts.",
