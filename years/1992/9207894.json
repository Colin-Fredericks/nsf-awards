 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                 Chemistry Division, Mark Johnson of Yale University will                        continue study the spectroscopy and dynamics of sequentially                    solvated anions and electrons in the gas phase.  The absorption                 spectra, photofragmentation dynamics, and photoelectron                         spectroscopy of complexes with a well-defined composition in                    free molecular jets will be monitored using tandem                              time-of-flight spectroscopies.  The isomers postulated to exist                 in the (H2O)n cluster anion system will be characterized, and                   the dependence of the spatial extent of the excess electron on                  cluster size will be determined in order to clarify the origin                  of charge transfer to solvent transitions of aqueous anions.                    Photoinduced intra-cluster reactions, including intra-cluster                   electron transfer and the O- + HO --> OH- + OH reaction will be                 examined.  These systems to be studied are intermediate between                 the solution phase and more traditional ion-molecule reaction                   studies and should provide valuable correlations.                               %%%                                                                             This project examines how excess charge is accommodated in                      finite, homogeneous media, such as aqueous solutions.  The                      focus of these studies is on charged aggregates of stable                       molecules held together by very weak forces which are more                      physical than chemical.  Unlike metal systems, in which the                     excess charge tends to be delocalized over the aggregate,                       different molecular systems vary widely in how they accommodate                 the excess charge.  Insights into the behavior of dissolved                     species are expected to result from these studies.",
