 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project contains two research areas: (1) thermistor                        modeling, which involves a nonlinear system of two degenerate                   elliptic partial differential equations, and (2) interfacial                    dynamics which involves the motion of hypersurfaces, the motion                 of level sets of solutions of parabolic partial differential                    equations, and the relations between these two motions.  For the                first problem, the investigator plans to use the classical                      analysis of elliptic partial differential equations, variational                inequalities, free boundary analysis, and some complex analysis                 to establish the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the                   solutions and to provide numerical schemes for the calculation of               the solutions and the fundamental relations between the voltage                 (or current) applied to the thermistor and its total resistivity,               which is essential for designing and testing thermistors.  For                  the interfacial dynamics problem, the investigator will use                     singular perturbation methods, viscosity methods, functional                    analysis, etc., to establish some physically based criteria for                 the motion of the interfaces, and to provide some mathematical                  justification on the uniformity between the modern models and the               classical models in solidification theory and related areas.                         A thermistor is a heat sensitive electrical resistor which                 has  been widely used in current regulation, switching, gas                     detection, control and alarms, etc.  The investigator will use                  mathematical tools to find relations among the characteristics of               thermistors, thereby providing guidelines for practical design                  and testing.  Interface, in the solidification case, is the                     boundary between solid and liquid.  Motion of the interface is                  essential to the solidification theory.  Many good models                       concerning the motion of interfaces have been proposed.  The                    investigator plans to justify rigorously these relations,                       especially the common aspects of various models, and find                       physically based criteria for the motion of the interfaces where                the current models give multiple choices.",
