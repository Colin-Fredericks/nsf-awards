 "awd_abstract_narration": "For some insect societies a colony can comprise several                    discrete nesting units.  This phenomenon of colony fractionation,               or polydomy, produces nest subunits that can differ primarily in                whether or not they contain a queen.  Since workers and their                   mother queen are in conflict over how reproductive energy should                be allocated polydomous colonies represent natural systems for                  studying conflict and cooperation within the squabbling family.                 Furthermore, polydomous colonies represent a tractable ecological               system for studying levels of selection.  Colonies of the ant                   species Myrmica punctiventris are seasonally polydomous:  in                    spring a colony emerges aboveground as a unit, but then                         fractionates.  Nest subunits are functionally autonomous during                 the summer months, but re-coalesce in fall for overwintering.                   Previous work has shown that workers can exploit this system to                 bias reproductive broods towards their own interests and away                   from the interests of their mother queen.  The proposed research                will characterize colony structure and reproductive allocation                  for three populations of this species; contextual analysis will                 allow us to distinguish selection on the local nesting unit                     versus on the entire colony.  A field experiment will be carried                out to assess the impact of ecological parameters for seasonal                  polydomy, reproductive allocation, and levels of selection in                   this species.  The research will provide considerable insight to                the evolutionary mechanics of social behavior.  Furthermore this                project, while primarily basic research, may have implications                  for control of pest ant species, which are notoriously                          polydomous.",
