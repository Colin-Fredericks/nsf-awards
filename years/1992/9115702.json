 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France                                      cooperative research in physical chemistry                                      between Eric A. Gislason of the University of                                   Chicago and Muriel Sizun and P.M. Guyon of the                                  University of Paris, Orsay.  The investigators                                  propose to continue experimental and                                            theoretical studies of ion-molecule collisions.                                 They will examine the charge transfer of                                        diatomic ions, extend their earlier work on                                     helium and hydrogen collisions, and develop a                                   new, sequential model for energy transfer in                                    atom-diatom collisions.                                                                                                                                         Dr. Gislason brings to this project extensive                                   experience in theoretical and experimental                                      research of ion-molecule collisions.                                            His current research deals with the theory of                                   molecular vibration in transition phases.  This                                 is complemented by the French investigators                                     expertise in experimental aspects of                                            ion-molecule collisions.  The  project will                                     benefit from access to the synchrotron facility                                 at the University of Paris, Orsay, one of the                                   world's centers for ion-molecule collision                                      studies.  And their combined efforts will                                       advance our understanding of the behavior of                                    molecules in the aggregate and the importance                                   of ion-molecule collisions in low pressure                                      processing plasmas.",
