 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research has found that auditors exhibit recency effects in                     revising initial beliefs or hypotheses.  This project will                      investigate factors which may moderate auditors' susceptibility to              order effects.  Research has also found that auditors are                       predisposed to focus on negative evidence as compared to positive               evidence.  These two effects may interact.  This project will test              the Belief Adjustment Model of Hogarth and Einhorn as a basis for               predictions about how recency effects can be eliminated or                      mitigated in settings in which auditors are highly sensitive to                 negative information.  The study should provide insight regarding               the prevalence of order effects among professionals exposed to                  unique decision environments who may respond to risks in the                    decision setting by using adaptive belief revision strategies to                moderate the recency effects found in earlier research.  The                    results could then be used to develop procedures for improving the              quality of the decision process.",
