 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Geology Departments of Bryn Mawr College, Bucknell                    University, Lafayette College, and Lehigh University have                       successfully formed a consortium fostering undergraduate geologic               research.  Important research opportunities in Pennsylvania and                 surrounding areas will be undertaken by undergraduates from these               institutions in subjects as diverse as tectonics and hydrogeology.                    To comprehend fully how a research project is conceived and               conducted, students will generate a proposal, conduct field work,               sampling, and/or laboratory studies, as appropriate, and                        periodically report on their research progress.  Ultimately they                will present their results formally to faculty and colleagues at                a Consortium symposium.  Independent, undergraduate research begins             with close supervision and guidance by one or more faculty members              and may evolve into senior theses or projects that reflect original             and individual student effort.  These projects are materially                   improved by discussion and interaction with other students, working             on allied problems.                                                                    Follow up activities will focus on revision of the student               reports in preparation for presentation of the findings in a                    symposium session, involving students and faculty, not only from                the Consortium Schools, but also from non-participating schools.                Special efforts will be made to invite students and faculty from                schools with large proportions of underrepresented students, both               to promote the efforts of the previous student projects and also                to recruit potential student/faculty pairs for the following year's             projects.",
