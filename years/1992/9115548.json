This research will be              based on understanding the factors which influence the structure                and electronic properties of electroactive polymers.  The first                 part of the work deals with the \"band structure engineering\" of                 electroactive polymers.  This is made possible by a combination of              accurate total energy and gradient calculations first leading to                reliable predictions of the geometric structure which is not                    readily available from experimental data.  Based on the established             structures, accurate band structure predictions can be carried out.             The effects of non-planarity, three-dimensional, interactions and               soliton lattices are taken into account.  Variations of chemical                composition will be analyzed.  In the second part of the research,              the vibrational spectra of conjugated polymers will be calculated.              The approach, which relies on empirical scaling calculations on                 monomers and dimers but does not use empirical data from the                    polymer, should make experimental infrared and Raman spectra much               more useful in determining structural features of a large class of              important materials for which present structural data is either                 incomplete or impossible to obtain.                                             %%%",
