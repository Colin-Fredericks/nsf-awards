 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to introduce more hands-on                           laboratory activity in the areas of ecology and plant science.                  The study of the causes for variation in organisms is a                         fundamental aspect of ecology and an essential step for                         understanding the process of natural selection. Students will                   conduct experiments in which they evaluate the causes for                       biological variation.  These causes are either environmental or                 genetic variation, or a combination of each.  Biochemical                       traits, such as enzyme activity, vary much like other aspects                   of organisms but can be measured accurately and quantitatively.                 Students will raise given strains of bacteria, plants and                       insects in two different set of environmental conditions, and                   different strains or subpopulations in a given environmental                    condition using water baths, plant growth chambers and                          biological incubators. Spectrophometry is used to assay the                     activity of specific biochemical systems from each organism.                    When students find that enzyme variation has a significant                      genetic component, an additional evaluation of protein                          polymorphism is conducted by means of protein electrophoresis.",
