 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multidatabase systems respond to the need of organizations to                   support applications that require information maintained by several             autonomous and possibly heterogeneous database systems.  A                      fundamental requirement underlying Multidatabase systems is the                 preservation of the autonomy of the individual database systems.                However, autonomy requirements cause problems in maintaining                    traditional database consistency in these systems, the reason being             that autonomy and consistency are conflicting requirements.                     Attempts to strike a balance between these two requirements have                focused on new correctness criteria.  However, very little analysis             has been done with respect to (a) the semantics of autonomy                     requirements and (b) their implications for both consistency                    requirements and implementation considerations. The goal of this                research is to systematically analyze autonomy and consistency by               applying a uniform specification technique to express autonomy                  requirements and correctness criteria, thereby explicitly showing               their relationships and identifying the tradeoffs between them.  By             understanding these tradeoffs and their effects on different parts              of a database system, this work will help in the development of                 Multidatabase systems and will have an impact on the integration of             other systems in which autonomy and consistency are requirements.",
