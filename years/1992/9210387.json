 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project calls for new research to resolve an outstanding                   controversy in corporate finance: how important were tax                        considerations in motivating corporate mergers in the early 1980s?              This issue is of interest to both public finance and financial                  economists, and the existing empirical evidence is contradictory.               This study will collect additional data on the share prices of                  acquired and acquiring firms, and investigate the details of the                merger transactions.  This project will yield interesting empirical             results on the takeover process.                                                                                                                                Specifically, the project will address the following questions.                 (1) Does the market reward bidders who successfully capture tax                 benefits?  Does the market penalize bidders who fail to optimize                the tax consequences of acquisitions?  (2) When a bidder fails to               capture tax benefits, is there systematic evidence that the                     acquisition is motivated by other potential gains?  (3) Are firms               with loss/credit carryforwards less likely to be taken over after               the Tax Reform Act of 1986?  (4) Are target firms with tax                      attributes that would have generated tax savings prior to the Tax               Reform Act of 1986 offered lower premia after the Tax Reform Act                of 1986?  Questions 3 and 4 were prompted by the fact that the Tax              Reform Act of 1986 effectively eliminated the two main sources of               acquisition tax gains - abolishing the benefits from writing up the             basis of target assets to their market values and severely                      restricting the merged firm's ability to offset taxable income with             target loss/credit carryforwards.",
