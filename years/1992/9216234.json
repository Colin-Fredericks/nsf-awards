 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of sound engineering                                            solutions for soil and soil-structure systems is                                important in the design and construction of the                                 material infrastructure that supports human                                     lives and the nation's economy: buildings,                                      bridges, earth dams, lifelines and tunnels for                                  communications and municipal electricity, gas,                                  water and sewer systems.  Additional                                            challenges are posed by growing environmental                                   problems, including the design and construction                                 of landfills and the evaluation and remediation                                 of contaminant transport by groundwater.  The                                   many uncertainties in the design of such                                        facilities are compensated for through                                          conservative designs, involving increased cost                                  and use of materials.  An alternative approach                                  is provided by the testing of physical                                          geotechnical models, specifically by                                            geotechnical centrifuge model tests.                                                                                                                            This symposium focusses on the application of                                   the geotechnical centrifuge testing technique to                                geotechnical, earthquake and environmental                                      problems, and it addresses a wide audience of                                   researchers and practitioners.                                                                                                                                  The symposium is the second day of a two-day                                    event, which begins with the official                                           inauguration of the Rensselaer Polytechnic                                      Institute 100 G-ton centrifuge, which has been                                  in operation since 1989.",
