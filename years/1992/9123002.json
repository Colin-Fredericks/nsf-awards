 "awd_abstract_narration": "The economic dependence of married women on their husbands is              an important yet hidden dimension of inequality in contemporary                 society.  This dependence persists even among employed wives, who               typically earn less than their husbands.  This project will provide             a new framework within which to view contemporary American marriage             by constructing and validating measures for three distinct                      dimensions of wives' material dependence:  the level of actual                  economic dependence, the level of economic independence possible                if homemaker wives were employed full-time, and the degree to which             wives are dependent upon their husbands for social prestige.  The               theoretical importance of these concepts will be examined by                    testing the explanatory power of models derived from sex-role                   socialization theory (the internalization of attitudes and                      aspirations as a result of early childhood upbringing) and a                    structural gender stratification theory (the concrete context of                work and family which either pushes women out of the labor force                or pulls them into it as lifetime workers) for predicting the level             of individual women's dependence.  Using data from the Career                   Development Study from the state of Washington and from the cross-              sectional, national probability sample of the National Survey of                Families and Households, these measures of material dependence will             be used to predict indicators of gender equity within marriage.                                                                                                      This project will fill a major gap in the sociological study               of marriage and the family, contributing to our understanding of                their nature and functioning and yielding knowledge about the                   consequences of economic dependence on the division of household                labor as well as on wife abuse.",
