 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of this research program is the                   creation of a public-use tape suitable for a prospective study of               aging in a random sample of 39,616 men mustered into the Union Army             during 1861-1865. Approximately 31,000 of the individuals in the                sample lived to be age 40 and over between 1870 and 1940.  The tape             will cover virtually the entire life-cycle of the recruits.  It                 will contain information on the socioeconomic characteristics of                the households in which they were reared and of the prevalence of               specific diseases in the localities in which they lived during                  their developmental ages;  it will also contain their health                    histories while in the service,  including various measures of                  stress;  and it will contain their occupational,  residential,  and             health histories from the dates they left the service until their               deaths,  as well as information on the cause of their deaths.                         The tape will provide the basis for four analytical projects              that are titled:  (1)  Exposure to Disease During Growing Ages and              War Service;  (2)  Early Predictors of Morbidity and Mortality at               Later Ages;  (3)  Secular Trends in Labor Force Activity at Older               Ages;  (4)  Intergenerational and Familial Aspects of Aging.                          The research team is first-rate,  well balanced in skills and             experienced in the areas in which they will be working.  The                    extraordinary data set produced will permit the exploration of                  important and little understood issues in socio-economic history                as well as in current policy.  In addition,  the analytical tools               and relationships developed should find extensive use in many                   disciplines.                                                                           Approximately,  two-thirds of the estimated $3,622,580 cost              of the project is being borne by the National Institute of Aging                (NIA). Other prospective funders outside NIA include the National               Science Foundation,  the National Medical Library,  and various                 private sources.  Their combined contributions should suffice to                assure the financial feasibility of the five-year project.",
