 "awd_abstract_narration": "In eukaryotes, newly replicated DNA assembles with histones and                 regulatory and general transcription factors to form nucleosomes                and transcription initiation complexes.  Competition between the                binding of regulatory factors to DNA and assembly of the same DNA               into nucleosomes may play a key role in establishing and                        maintaining patterns of differential gene expression.  The goal of              this proposal is to help elucidate mechanisms which govern the                  outcome of this competition in vivo and guide studies of                        transcription using chromatin templates in vitro.  Initial studies              demonstrated that heat shock factor (HSF) can activate                          transcription while bound to a nucleosome in Saccharomyces                      cerevisiae.  This result suggests that the position which a factor              binding site adopts when it is packaged in a nucleosome influences              the outcome of competitive assembly events in vivo.  To test this               possibility and to determine why HSF, like most regulatory factors,             is usually bound to nucleosome-free DNA, we will systematically                 examine the influence of helical orientation and other geometric                factors on the ability of regulatory factors to bind to nucleosomal             DNA or, alternatively, to prevent the formation of nucleosomes.                 Cells will be transfected with plasmids that present cells with a               choice between the binding of a regulatory factor to DNA and the                assembly of the same DNA into a uniquely positioned nucleosome.                 HSF and the ACEI factor will be used as model regulatory factors.               Results will be assessed using transcription and high resolution                genomic footprinting assays.                                                    %%%                                                                             Because of its great length, DNA must be extensively compacted to               fit into the nuclei of cells.  Compaction of DNA is accomplished by             histones, proteins which associate with DNA to form nucleosomes.                Nucleosomes are altered or absent from DNA in regions bound by a                second class of proteins, namely those which regulate gene                      expression.  Replication of DNA partially disrupts nucleosomes and              displaces regulatory proteins.  Thus, DNA must be repackaged each               cell generation.  Whether repackaging is by histones or by                      regulatory proteins may be central to whether specific patterns of              gene expression are maintained or altered.  However, mechanisms                 which govern how DNA is packaged in vivo are poorly understood.                 The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate these mechanisms.             We will determine how the unique configuration which DNA adopts in              some nucleosomes affects its packaging.  The occurrence of this                 unique configuration, termed nucleosome positioning, suggests that              if a DNA segment were forced by the binding of a rgulatory protein              to adopt an alternative configuration in the nucleosome, the                    stability of the nucleosome would be impaired.  To test whether                 this can account for the formation of nucleosome-free regions, we               will construct a series of test DNA sequences.  These sequences,                when introduced into yeast, will present cells with a choice                    between \u0131a! the binding of a regulatory factor which excludes or                shifts the position of nucleosomes, \u0131b! the assembly of a                       positioned nucleosome which excludes the regulatory factor, or \u0131c!              the formation of a factor:nucleosome complex.  The choice cells                 make will be related to the structure of nucleosomes, and                       interactions between regulatory proteins and DNA.",
