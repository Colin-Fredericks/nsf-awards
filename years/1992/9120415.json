Two classes of models are contrasted:  serial models,               in which only one interpretation of an ambiguity is considered, and             constrained parallel models, in which several interpretations may               be briefly considered in parallel.  A second factor is whether                  probabilistic cues may influence the interpretation(s) that are                 generated for an ambiguity.  Two different ambiguities are                      investigated:  syntactic ambiguities and pronominal reference                   ambiguities.  The specific aims are to investigate 1) the                       interaction of cues that are encountered before an ambiguity and                ones encountered after an ambiguity, 2) the interaction of cues                 from different levels of linguistics representations, such as                   syntactic and discourse-level cues, and 3) individual differences               in ambiguity resolution as a function of working memory capacity.                                                                                               Earlier research has relied heavily on one dependent measure,                   reading time at the disambiguation.  Six supplementary measures are             proposed:  1) examination of reading time in other regions, 2)                  studies in which ambiguities are resolved with a highly favored                 interpretation, 3) examination of cues that follow the ambiguity,               4) norming of stimuli to manipulate cue strength on a continuum, 5)             the use of examination of individual differences.  It is expected               that the addition of these methods will distinguish the opposing                models more precisely than in much previous work.",
