 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bleaching, the loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates)=\"zooxanthellae\"               hereafter) of their pigments, of reef corals and other                          invertebrates has become a world-wide problem in tropical marine                ecosystem, linked by some researchers to global warming.  The                   results of bleaching have potentially devastating environmental,                ecological and economic effects in the Caribbean, IndoPacific, an               other tropical marine areas.  Though there is some experimental                 work showing involvement of both higher than average temperature                and light, the mechanisms involved in bleaching are not well                    understood this project will test three hypotheses.                                                                                                             1.   Bleaching in nature is caused by high temperature stress                        coupled with high energy blue light (and possibly UV-A between                  380-400nm).  Preliminary evidence shows that while high                         temperature alone will induce bleaching, natural light                          exposure during high temperature treatment exacerbates the                      effect by lowering the temperature threshold and time to                        bleaching at a given temperature.  this study will determine                    which component of light is responsible for this effect and                     the mechanisms of action.  Early theories on bleaching had                      light playing a major role, but experimental evidence has not                   yet supported this contention.  Potentially harmful chemical                    alterations associated with high energy wavelengths of blue                     light (and possibly some near-blue wavelengths of UV-A, that                    are not adsorbed by UV-protecting pigments found in corals)                     are not only consistent with field observations of bleaching,                   but are also supported by both laboratory and field-based                       preliminary experiments.                                                   2.   The mechanisms of temperature-light induced bleaching involves                  the irreversible dissociation of the chlorophyll-protein                        associations in the chloroplast.  The harmful effects of high                   temperatures and light on algae include the irreversible                        separation or inactivation of the chlorophyll-protein                           complexes associated with reaction centers in the chloroplast.                  Electron transport activity and eventually carbon fixation                      decrease markedly.                                                         3.   High light and temperatures cause decreases in \"protective\"                     pigments which absorb ultraviolet light.  The role of                           different wavelengths of light in conjunction with high                         temperature in determining concentrations of UV-screening                       pigments will be determined as well as their relationship with                  photosynthetic rates.                                                      These hypotheses will be tested using cultured and freshly isolated             zooxanthellae, and intact hosts both in the laboratory and in                   field-based experiments.",
