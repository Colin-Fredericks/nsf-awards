 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human database designers apply their accumulated experience and               commonsense reasoning abilities to each new design task. Recently,              a number of expert systems have been developed that attempt to                  automate the database design process. Although these systems may                have a high degree of expertise in database design, they typically              know very little about anything else. As a result, they often have              to ask questions that appear unnecessary or trivial, thus                       detracting from their credibility as experts and increasing the                 effort required of the user. The objective of this research is to               add commonsense reasoning capabilities to a proven database design              expert system. The commonsense reasoner will employ a simple,                   generic model of the business environment that it can extend semi-              automatically with facts \"learned\" during each design session.                  The project involves conceptual work on the nature and                          representation of commonsense knowledge as the basis for a later                implementation. The implemented system will be tested to assess the             value of the commonsense facility. This research is expected to aid             in designing computer systems that combine a high degree of                     expertise in a particular subject with general knowledge about the              world at large and have the ability to apply both to solving                    problems.",
