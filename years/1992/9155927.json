 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy is the first and only experience in science for many                  college students. Yet laboratories in introductory astronomy                    have long suffered because of the difficulty of doing                           \"experiments\" with the faint light from the heavens. They are                   rarely experiential or \"hands-on\", relying instead on analysis                  of photographs and data tables provided ahead of time. The                      available laboratory material today also exemplifies techniques                 that are increasingly out-of-date and unrepresentative of what                  astronomers really do. Students rightly regard much of the lab                  as make-work, rarely reinforcing the concepts presented in                      class.A series of new exercises are being developed for the                     introductory lab that addresses these problems. Some will be                    \"hands-on exercises\" centered around observations with CCD                      cameras on small telescopes, of the kind available to many                      schools. Other exercises will be simulations of observations,                   which can be extremely realistic, since much astronomical                       observation is done using computers as front ends for various                   types of telescopes. Standardized software tools are being                      developed for all the labs, and data taking and analysis are                    being integrated with existing spreadsheet programs. The                        finished labs will consist of software, writeups, and teachers'                 guides, as well as technical manuals and will be made available                 to other institutions.The new exercises give students in the                    course a more satisfying and realistic experience in astronomy,                 and provide impetus for revitalizing the introductory astronomy                 labs in similar courses in other colleges and universities.",
