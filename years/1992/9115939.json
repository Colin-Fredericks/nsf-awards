 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is focused on basic theoretical aspects                 of ego-moving observer (e.g. a camera), a huge amount of visual                 information is captured.  The aim of this project is to extract                 relevant visual information from a sequence of images and to use                it as part of feedback control loops.  In other words, to                       characterize changing visual data using only a few variables                    which are essential for the dynamic response of the observer                    relative to the scene, and use these to control the motion of the               observer.  The vision-based algorithms will be integrated in a                  real-time closed loop control system that has been developed at                 FAU.  In addition, the Robot Systems Division at the National                   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has agreed to                      provide FAU with all the available hardware and software that are               necessary for the successful completion of this project.  Based                 on previous and on-going research work, there is reason to                      believe that a new, promising direction for visual motion with                  sound theoretical basis is emerging.",
