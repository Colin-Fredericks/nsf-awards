 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted on quantum chaos, which is the study of              wave systems in low dimension where the eikonal (classical) limit               is chaotic.  This field is highly interdisciplinary since many                  intriguing fundamental and technologically important problems in                chemistry, molecular physics, atomic physics, condensed matter                  physics, device engineering, etc, are related to work being done.               In many cases problems in quantum chaos can be cast in the form of              waves in pseudo-random potentials, which makes a connection to                  related problems of waves in random and incommensurate potentials.              %%%                                                                             Quantum chaos is an exciting cross-disciplinary field which                     combines the behavior of classical nonlinear dynamical systems with             quantum mechanics.  It is even unclear how these two highly                     disparate concepts should be merged to provide models for physical              systems.  The present research contributes to the foundations of                this field, particularly as it relates to condensed matter physics,             and develops models for real systems.",
