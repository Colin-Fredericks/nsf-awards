 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal studies a flow based separation technique for                     fractionating particles.  The separation is carried out in a                    rectangular flow chamber which is generally under 5 mm in                       thickness, and approximately 2 cm in width and 20 cm in                         length.  At the entrance of the channel, a splitter plate                       which extends lengthwise a few millimeters down the tube,                       partitions the inlet region of the channel into two halves.  A                  carrier fluid is pumped into the chamber on one side of the                     splitter, and the fluid containing the particles is introduced                  on the other side.  As the fluids pass the splitter edge, a                     two phase adjacent Poiseuille flow is created with fluid near                   the wall boundaries moving slower than fluid in the center of                   the channel.  As the particles are carried along the length of                  the channel, a field applied in a direction perpendicular to                    the flow axis forces the particles to migrate towards the                       carrier stream.  Gravitational and electric forces are two                      examples of fields which can be used.  The separation is                        effected by the fact that the magnitude of the force exerted                    by the field on the particles depends on a particular particle                  characteristic, and if that characteristic differs between                      particles then so does the magnitude of the force.  Examples                    of such characteristics are size which would result in a                        different gravitational force and electric charge.  Particles                   more strongly acted upon by the applied force migrate further                   into the carrier stream where they decelerate as they are                       entrained by slower moving fluid.  After the particles have                     translated a certain distance downstream, particles which are                   not acted upon as strongly by the force are more centrally                      located and have moved further downstream than particles more                   strongly acted upon which are nearer the boundary and have not                  progressed as far downstream.                                                                                                                                   During the last two and one-half decades, the PI developed the                  technique of collecting the particles by taking advantages of                   the developing separation distance between the particles along                  the flow direction.  As the fluid leaves the channel, those                     travelling near the center elute first and can be collected,                    while those travelling near the boundary elute later and can                    be collected separately.  The PI has termed this techniques                     FFF for field flow fractionation. In the development of FFF,                    scale-up proved difficult and the technique could only be used                  for analytical measurement since the quantities harvested were                  very small.  In contrast to FFF, a different technique for                      harvesting the separation is to use a splitter at the                           downstream end to divide the stream into two exiting streams.                   One stream would contain the particles moving near the center,                  while the other would contain the particles moving closer to                    the channel cell boundary.  The PI has termed this separation                   CSF for continuous SPLITT fractionation and has been working                    on CSF since 1985 (refs. 11-19 of the proposal).  The research                  suggested in this proposal is concerned with scaleup of the                     cell, improving its performance, and examining different                        separation mechanisms.",
