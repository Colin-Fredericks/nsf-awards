 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ralph Roskies and Michael Levine have organized a workshop on Fast              Processes in Protein Folding Dynamics.  Understanding how proteins              fold is one of the central challenges in biology today.  Only                   recently, with the advent of advanced computational methods, has                it been possible to simulate the dynamics of protein folding.  To               apply theoretical and computational approaches in biology it is                 essential to link in experimentation; today, technical limitations              lie in the way of interlinking theory, simulation, and experiment.              The workshop will be structure to develop new approaches to central             questions or challenges by bringing together scientists from                    different disciplines who would ordinarily not attend the same                  meeting, by developing seed questions in advance of the meeting to              focus the discussion throughout the course of the meeting, by                   setting aside specific panel sessions following each major set of               talks to allow open and extensive discussion of possibilities and               difficulties.  The meeting will help  set a research agenda for a               diverse community of scientist drawn from several disciplines.",
