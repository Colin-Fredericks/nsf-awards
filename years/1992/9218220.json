 "awd_abstract_narration": "The LMER (Land Margin Ecosystems Research) program addresses the                need for research on land-margin ecosystems, those at the interface             of continental land masses and  coastal oceans. The LMER program is             part of the U.S. Global Change Research program supported jointly               by the Biological Oceanography Program of the Division of Ocean                 Sciences and the Long Term Ecosystems Studies Program of the                    Biological Sciences Directorate. These land margin ecosystems are               being affected by direct and indirect results of human population               growth, and land use changes. In the future, they may be severely               affected by rising sea levels as a result of global climate change.             The LMER program is designed to document and evaluate the changes               going on at this land sea interface. The LMER program at present is             made up of five large multi-investigator, interdisciplinary                     research projects that emphasize experimental studies, various                  types of models, and a comparative ecosystems approach.                                                                                                         This project seeks to establish and maintain an LMER coordinating               office and committee headed by John Hobbie of the Marine Biological             Laboratory as chair in order to carry out the many functions                    necessary for a large interdisciplinary program.  The various tasks             of the coordination office include: the planning and coordinating               meetings for the Steering committee and the LMER scientists to                  facilitate activities, synthses and intercomparisons within the                 LMER research projects and coordinating activities with other                   coastal oriented programs as well as other global change research               programs on the national and international level.",
