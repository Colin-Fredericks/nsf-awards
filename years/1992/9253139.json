The IChO originated in 1968                   with participants from Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary; the                  United States first sent a team in 1984.  This is the first                     time the Olympiad has been hosted by the United States.  The                    competition brings together the world's top high school-age                     chemistry students.  Students take a five-hour theoretical                      examination and a five-hour laboratory practical examination.                   Between test days, and while the exams are being graded,                        students have the opportunity to tour the host country and                      interact with their peers from other nations.                                                                                                                   Delegations consisting of four students and two adult mentors                   from each of 35 countries have been invited to participate in                   the 12-day event which will be held in Pittsburgh,                              Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.  Other supporters of the                      project are the American Chemical Society and the U.S.                          chemical industry.",
