 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ratio of Ge/Si in biogenic opal has enormous potential as a                 tracer of the balance between chemical fluxes from continental                  weathering and hydrothermal sources and as a tracer of oceanic                  processes such as productivity.  However, the degree to which this              tracer can be successfully applied to these problems critically                 depends on the mass-balance of the Ge-Si system and the chemical                behavior of these two elements in the oceans.  It appears that the              current understanding of the Ge-Si system is incomplete since                   estimates of the hydrothermal Si flux based on the Ge-Si system are             much less than fluxes estimated from other tracers or models.  The              difficulty with current models of the Ge-Si system is that they do              not account for the probability that the marine geochemical cycle               for the Ge includes significant sinks other than biogenic opal.  A              series of experiments will be conducted to evaluate the flux of                 oceanic Ge to nonbiogenic sediment components.  The Ge content and              key Ge/element ratios will be characterized in eolian source                    materials as well as in North Pacific pelagic sediments.  The                   results should provide important constraints on the accumulation                rate of nonbiogenic Ge in the oxic pelagic environment.",
