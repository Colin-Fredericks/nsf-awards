 "awd_abstract_narration": "All common approaches to parallelizing compilers, high-level                    languages such as functional languages, and explicitly parallel                 languages - require a common base of support.  This work will                   encapsulate this support in a language that abstracts over resource             management decisions and machine details, and develops a runtime                support system on different classes of MIMD machines for implementing           this language.  The language can then be used by implementors of other          high level approaches to parallel programming as a universal and                efficient back-end.  It can also be used for efficient application              programming.  The language and the runtime system will support dynamic          load balancing, and small to medium computational grainsize, to meet            the above objectives.  For expressiveness as well as efficiency, the            language will support a rich set of primitives for expressing specific          forms of information sharing.                                                                                                                                   The runtime support system for the language has been implemented                already on distributed memory machines such as iPSC/2, and shared               memory machines such as Sequent Symmetry, and a preliminary compiler            has been written.  Performance results on these machines have been              obtained on simple benchmarks and are very encouraging: they show               that we can obtain excellent speedups with many processors, while               costing only a few percent overhead over the best sequential C                  programs, on one processor.",
