 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elasmobranch fishes (sharks, skates and rays) have an extremely                 sensitive and specialized sensory system that is critical for the               detection of weak electric fields in their marine environments.                 This sense is used in finding prey and in orientation.  A                       significant problem is that the fish's own activities such as                   swimming and respiration, stimulate these electroreceptors.                     Therefore, mechanisms must exist within the brain for separating                responses to important external electric fields as distinct from                this self-generated \"noise\".  Previous experiments from this                    laboratory have shown that such a process is accomplished in the                first stages of sensory information-processing in the hindbrain                 region.                                                                                                                                                         A series of physiological and anatomical studies are being conducted            to better understand the mechanisms responsible for this noise-                 reduction process.  In general, separating signal information from              noise is a problem that has broad significance for understanding how            all vertebrate sensory systems operate.  Therefore, the results                 obtained from these experiments are relevant for other sensory                  systems in all vertebrates species, including humans.",
