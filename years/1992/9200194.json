 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Nevada, Reno, with its outstanding                       interdisciplinary program in the areas of hydrology, hydrogeology               and water resources, and with strong affiliation and interaction                with the Deseart Research Institute, will conduct this REU program              in such a way as to exchange ideas, discuss data, and assist in                 cross discipline \"fertilization\".                                                                                                                                    Students will participate for 10 weeks during the summer.                  Each week students will meet in a seminar format.  In addition,                 during most of the program the students will meet in a semi-                    informal \"research group\" setting to discuss their own research                 results, interact with the other students and faculty advisors                  and/or have laboratory demonstrations of equipment.  Faculty will               give overviews of their research programs.  Emphasis will be placed             on how student and faculty research fits into the bigger,                       interdisciplinary picture of hydrological sciences.                                                                                                                  During the last week the seminar and research group meeting                will be combined so that the REU students synthesize their                      information, and practice their communication skills by presenting              their results.",
