 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-range goals of the proposed research are to determine,                 at the molecular level, the structural adaptations that enable                  the tubulins of Antarctic fishes to polymerize at the low body                  temperatures (-2 to +2 C) experienced by these cold-adapted                     vertebrates, and to examine the dynamics of the fish                            microtubules.  The specific objectives of this project are five                 in number:  1) to compare the assembly energetics of brain                      tubulins from Antarctic and temperate nototheniid fishes; 2) to                 clone and to sequence cDNAs (DNAs complementary to messenger                    RNAs) that encode the brain tubulins of Antarctic and temperate                 nototheniid fishes; 3) to determine the structures of tubulin                   genes from an Antarctic fish, and possibly from a temperate                     nototheniid; 4) to determine the structural features responsible                for the functional differences between brain and egg tubulins of                an Antarctic fish; and 5) to characterize the dynamic behaviors                 of Antarctic fish microtubules at low temperatures.  Molecular-                 biological experiments will be performed on tubulin cDNAs and                   genes derived from the nucleic acids of the Antarctic cod,                      Notothenia coriiceps neglecta, and of its temperate congener, the               New Zealand black cod, N. angustata.  Additionally, the dynamics                of Antarctic fish microtubules at low temperatures will be                      examined by video-enhanced light-microscopic methods.  Comparison               of the primary sequences and posttranslational modifications of                 tubulins from Antarctic fishes with those of tubulins from                      related temperate fishes and warm-blooded vertebrates should                    reveal the molecular interactions and structural features                       necessary for microtubule assembly at low temperatures.  This                   work will provide valuable information concerning the structure                 of tubulin genes from an extreme Antarctic poikilotherm.",
