 "awd_abstract_narration": "TERC, in collaboration with three states and others, will                       create and implement the first phase of the development of                      server and client software that provides the functionality                      needed to make the National Research and Education Network                      meet the needs of precollege educators.  The long-range goal                    is to facilitate the kind of network-based student and                          teacher collaboration which supports the reform needed in                       mathematics and science education.  This will be achieved by                    simplifying access to NREN and providing software                               functionality that supports collaboration on the computers                      typically used in schools for telecomputing.  Issues of                         technical and administrative infrastructure building, of                        marketing of educational services, and of controlling                           student use of NREN resources will also be addressed.                                                                                                           In this phase of the work, TERC will work closely with                          teachers, mid-level networks, potential educational service                     providers, telecommunications experts, and its state                            partners to assess educational needs, technical resources,                      and software standards.  A minimal set of the resulting                         specifications will be implemented, disseminated to                             participating states and other institutions, incorporated in                    TERC telecomputing-based projects, and evaluated.",
