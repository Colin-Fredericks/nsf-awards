 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant will enable exploratory research for                        development of a full scale proposal on the transformation of legal             identities.  The project investigates how the identity of \"leper\"               is being transformed on the island of Molokai, in Hawaii, in the                context of international tourism and of local, regional, and                    international struggles over the acquisition of land in Hawaii.                 A central theoretical focus of the research is to flush out the                 process and meaning of reclaiming or reinventing legal histories                and contemporary identities.  The case of \"the leper\" is an example             of a legal identity that was at one time excluded and punished and              now is being transformed and mobilized to secure entitlements, such             as property.  This transformation is examined in the context of the             colonial history of Hawaii and the present effort by remnants of                the nineteenth century leper colony in Kalaupapa to retain their                rights to the settlement in the process of its establishment as a               national historical park.  The project traces the emergence of a                new local identity for \"lepers\" by considering how contemporary                 sufferers of Hansen's disease create a legal, cultural, and                     political space for themselves, reworking the imagery of an                     oppressive colonial past in the context of a neocolonialist tourist             industry through which their claims to entitlement may be secured               and/or threatened at the same time.                                                                                                                             The research contributes to empirical and theoretical work on the               ways in which law and other institutions construct identities while             at the same time structuring forums which people use to reshape                 their histories and make entitlement claims.  It has wider                      theoretical implications for the intersection of legal and medical              definitions, the conflict of state and federal notions of land                  tenure and use, and the changes wrought in the legal landscape by               a dramatically changed economic situation.",
