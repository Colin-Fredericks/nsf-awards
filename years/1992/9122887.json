 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modeling and empirical measurements suggest that much of the                    ocean's margin is net heterotrophic that is utilizing more                      organic matter then is produced by photosynthesis.  Seasonally,                 however, many continental shelves are dominated by autotrophic                  processes and may then export organic matter to the ocean's                     interior.  This annual cycle of trophic status is largely the                   result of an interactive two factor response by bacteria to low                 temperature and low substrate concentration.  Bacterial isolates                from the Arctic Ocean, the Labrador Current, and the subtropical                southeastern continental shelf all indicate greatly reduced rates               of growth when cultured at their annual minimum temperature and                 at low substrate concentrations, comparable to those normally                   present in seawater.  Little is known, however, about net                       metabolism in arctic marine communities.  Bacterial production is               very low during the early spring period when most primary                       production is within the sea ice, and it is higher in late summer               after the open-water phytoplankton bloom, all based on limited                  data, also very limited geographically.  This project will result               in an extensive concurrent data set on phytoplankton biomass,                   bacterial and microzooplankton abundance, nutrient uptake                       (nitrate and ammonium), inorganic nutrients, hydrographic                       variables, primary production, microbial secondary production,                  and microbial respiration in the Arctic Ocean.  Knowledge of the                autotrophy-heterotrophy status of the arctic will be an important               consideration for modeling the global carbon cycle and for                      predicting the effects of global climate change, as well as for                 understanding and modeling polar food webs.",
