 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to characterize the resonant                      frequencies and ionic currents of toadfish saccular hair cells in               an attempt to reveal either a regional mapping of these properties              or a grouping of particular electrophysiological properties.  Such              grouping may reveal a coding in the hair cells of the saccule that              is neither regional nor solely for frequency, but perhaps for other             properties of the sensory stimulus.  It is anticipated that this                work will lead to an understanding of the function of the saccule               and to future experiments that will define the role of these ionic              currents in sensory coding in hair cells in general.  The ionic                 currents in the hair cells will be characterized and then related               to the hair cell morphology.  The saccular macula has macro- and                microscopic morphological division (by light and scanning electron              microscopy); cells will be sampled from these regions for the                   experiments to be performed.  The magnitude and kinetics of                     activation and deactivation of the four potassium currents found in             the hair cell will be determined.  I(k) will be isolated by                     blocking IK(Ca) with TEA or charybdotoxin at voltages where the A               current is inactivated.  Voltage paradigms designed to reveal the               A current and inward rectifier will provide a map of these currents             by cell type and location.  Also, the resonant frequency of each                hair cell will be determined.  Hair cell resonant frequencies will              be correlated with the currents measured below and mapped on the                saccule.  While in currrent clamp, action potential production by               the hair cell will be tested using positive current steps.  The                 hypothesis underlying this research is that the diverse complements             of ionic currents found in toadfish saccular hair cells are not                 configured to code only frequency, but also may enable the cell to              respond optimally to other attributes of the auditory stimulus.                                                                                                 There is considerable unexplained diversity in hair cell ionic                  currents.  It does not appear that the diversity is due to a                    regional distribution of cell types attributable to segregation by              auditory (fast kinetics, high frequency) or vestibular (slow                    kinetics, low frequency) function.  Additionally, the range of                  resonant frequencies in the saccule (107 - 175 Hz) does not include             either the toadfish calling frequency (up to 250 Hz) or hearing                 freqency (up to 700 Hz).  These and other observations cast some                doubt on the concept that current kinetics are coding only                      characteristic frequency.  Perhaps one set of cells codes frequency             and another transients, e.g.  The experiments are therefore                     designed to look for sub-sets of cells with specific ionic current              composition that may respond differently to simulated transducer                currents.  These sub-sets will be classed with their morphology,                particularly hair cell bundle morphology, site of origin and                    response to three putative efferent transmitters.  Due to the                   technical difficulties of using either sound or bimorph stimulation             at characteristic frequency ranges in isolated cells, simulated                 transducer currents will be used.  Simulated currents also have an              advantage in that features of the stimulus can be manipulated to                test their interaction with ionic currents.",
