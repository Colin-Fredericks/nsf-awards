 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of the processes active in determining the              characteristics of aerosols that are removed from the arctic                    atmosphere and deposited in the Greenland ice sheet.  These                     processes involve the dynamics of tropospheric and stratospheric                mass exchange, the efficiency with which aerosols and associated                chemical species are removed from the lower atmosphere, the                     relative importance of wet and dry deposition, and the early                    post-depositional chemical and concentration changes in the snow.               Knowledge of these processes is crucial to the reconstruction of                paleoatmospheres from the record that is preserved in the ice                   sheet.                                                                               Air sample filters and snow and ice samples collected at the               Atmospheric Chemistry Camp that is part of the Greenland Ice Core               drilling program will be analyzed for radionuclides, including                  Beryllium-7, Beryllium-10, Chlorine-36, and Lead-210.  Beryllium-7              is a cosmogenic radionuclide that is useful as a tracer of                      intrusions of stratospheric air, while Lead-210 results from the                decay of radon emitted from the Earth's surface and is a tracer for             continental air masses.  While Chlorine-36 is an important                      modulator in ozone chemistry, its ratio to Beryllium-10 may                     possibly become a method for dating ice cores older than 50,000                 years.  Results to date have been mixed because the ratio can                   fluctuate greatly over small depth intervals.  This project however             will obtain data on time scales short enough to determine whether               short term differences in the transport mechanism or seasonal                   variations in the efficiency of the removal process cause the                   observed fluctuations.",
