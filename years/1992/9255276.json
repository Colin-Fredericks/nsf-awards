 "awd_abstract_narration": "This book was developed by OERI to help parents meet goal 4 of                  the National Education Goals.  It has some descriptive text, a                  number of activities that parents and children can do together,                 and an extensive list of resources for parents and children.                    The book has been very successful, and OERI has printed 150,000                 copies and distributed them through the Consumer Information                    Center.                                                                                                                                                         The copies being printed under this agreement will fill orders                  still being received by the Consumer Information Center for free                copies.  The inside front cover will indicate that these copies                 were printed and distributed by the National Science Foundation.                When we get ready to do a new edition, we will check with NSF to                assure that the Science in the book is current.",
