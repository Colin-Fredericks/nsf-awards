 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work is in progress on the cycling of trace metals between sediment             and water in the continental margin of California.  Fluxes of                   nutrients and trace metals are being determined by using the USC                free vehicle bottom lander and by calculation of gradients in pore              waters of sediments on a millimeter scale.  A surprising result of              the initial work is that the highest rate of remineralization of                metals from the sediment appears to be from well oxygenated waters,             not from sediments in the depth range of the oxygen minimum zone.               Moreover the high fluxes are linked with high rates of oxygen                   consumption, carbon oxidation, and calcium carbonate dissolution.               Consequently, new work is addressing the association between metal              and carbon cycling.  Measurements of fluxes out of the sediments in             Monterey Bay are being compared to ongoing measurements of sediment             trap carbon fluxes (by Chavez) to determine whether seasonality in              the carbon signal is reflected by remineralization rates of metals.             A detailed study is also being made of fluxes derived from                      modelling pore water profiles, compared to those from the benthic               chambers, which tend to give higher flux values.  The discrepancy               suggests rapid diagenetic reactions in the fluff layer at the                   sediment surface, or irrigation by infauna; the possibilities are               being investigated.",
