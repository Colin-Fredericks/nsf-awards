 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop fast and accurate                       solution techniques for recursive least squares problems and                    analyze them through theoretical and experimental studies.                      These techniques will be based on accurate downdating                           algorithms, fast rotations, and robust direction-of-arrival                     estimation algorithms.  The preliminary investigations on the                   full rank downdating problems show that the existing                            algorithms vary greatly in their stability and speed.  The                      stability and complexity analysis will be an essential part in                  developing the improved algorithms and the algorithm                            development will utilize techniques such as fast rotations and                  iterative refinement.  The results will be extended to design                   block algorithms that can efficiently handle multiple updating                  and downdating simultaneously.  Although the singular value                     decomposition (SVD) produces excellent solutions for rank                       deficient problems, it is costly to calculate and modify the                    SVD.  The research will extend the recently developed rank                      revealing orthogonal decomposition, which can provide fast                      solutions to rank deficient recursive problems.  The results                    will be applied to the design of novel adaptive direction-of-                   arrival estimation algorithms, which are expected to produce                    significantly faster and accurate algorithms.  Parallel                         implementation of the algorithms will be conducted on the CM-5                  computer to establish their practical values in real time                       applications.",
