 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be undertaken in order to develop new theoretical and             computational techniques and software for determining the                       structural, electronic and magnetic properties of bulk solids,                  surfaces and interfaces.  Specific projects include (1) the                     development of fully relativistic moment polarized thin film Full               Potential Linearized Augmented Plane Wave method and software for               carrying out relativistic studies of magnetism, magnetic anisotropy             and magneto-optical studies on surfaces and interfaces; (2) methods             for calculating forces acting on atoms using the techniques                     developed in (1); (3) the development of the density functional                 coupled channel equation approach into a sophisticated                          computational method which can be used efficiently as the starting              point for the next steps in solving the many-body problem with                  other techniques (including the quantum Monte Carlo method).                    Unique features of (3) include the ability to solve the energy band             problem in more than three-dimensions which may be useful in                    describing quasi-crystals.                                                      %%%                                                                             Continued research will be done on the magnetic properties of bulk,             surface and interfacial magnetism based on calculations of the                  electronic structure.  Additional work will be done on the                      development of computational techniques which will facilitate the               efficient and accurate calculations of these properties.  The group             at Northwestern is one of the international leaders doing this type             of work.",
