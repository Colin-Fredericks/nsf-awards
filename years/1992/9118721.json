 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transport of cytoplasmically synthesized proteins to cellular               organelles and insertion into membranes is a fundamental question               confronting biologists.  As a rule, chloroplast proteins are                    synthesized on free ribosomes and post-translationally imported                 into chloroplasts while Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) proteins are                 synthesized on membrane bound ribosomes and co-translationally                  imported to the ER.  Proteolytic precursor maturation and sorting               for transport to their final intracellular site occurs in the ER                and golgi.  Immunoelectronmicroscopy has localized the Euglena                  chloroplast protein LHCPII to the golgi apparatus during times of               active synthesis.  Euglena pLHCPII is a polyprotein synthesized                 on membrane bound ribosomes.  Photoinduction of Euglena LHCPII is               translationally controlled at initiation or an early stage of                   elongation.  Taken together, these results suggest that Euglena                 LHCPII is co-translationally transported into the ER and golgi                  apparatus prior to import into chloroplasts.  This contrasts with               the direct post-translational uptake of precursor proteins into                 higher plant and green algal chloroplasts.  The purpose of this                 research is to use in vivo pulse labeling and organelle                         fractionation as well as in vivo translocation studies into                     microsmes and chloroplasts (independently and sequentially) to                  delineate the steps required and intracellular compartments                     involved in the novel pathway Euglena utilizes for the transport                of cytoplasmically synthesized proteins to chloroplasts.                        %%%                                                                             The assembly of chloroplast membranes requires the synthesis and                transport of constituent proteins from various cellular                         compartments.  This research will delineate the cellular site of                synthesis of the photosynthetic enzyme complex \"Light Harvesting                Chlorophyll-Protein II\" and elucidate the mechanism by which it                 is transported into the developing chloroplast structure.                       Information gained will increase our understanding of the                       biosynthesis and assembly of membrane-localized multienzyme                     complexes.",
