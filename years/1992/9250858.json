 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is to update and substantially upgrade the gamma                    ray spectroscopy component of the nuclear physics laboratory                    program for physics/applied physics majors and physics                          concentration education majors at Xavier.  By acquiring a high                  purity, high-resolution germanium (HPGe) detector and by                        assembling modern computer based multichannel analyzer systems,                 significant improvements in gamma ray spectroscopy experiments                  will be achieved.  Two such systems are proposed, one for                       germanium and one for sodium iodide.  Each system are comprised                 of state-of-the-art hardware and software.  Each system makes                   significant and appropriate use of two recently acquired IBM                    PS/2 Model 80 computers in the nuclear laboratory.  Student                     experiments and research projects are enhanced and improved by                  the increased resolution of the HPGe detector and by the                        powerful analysis and library features of the software.                         Instruction in the principles of photon detection, gamma ray                    physics, and nuclear physics is being enhanced and increased                    and training in modern computer-based nuclear data acquisition                  and analysis techniques is being provided.  Such training is                    important for undergraduates who will later work in high                        technology industries or graduate research laboratories.  The                   spectroscopy systems also provide opportunities for more                        meaningful undergraduate student research projects.",
