 "awd_abstract_narration": "In sharp contrast to the past, the American economy has                         experienced stagnation in the growth of average, real wages over                almost two decades now.  This stagnant growth covers an equally                 unprecedented divergence in the trend of real wages between high                and low wage earners, which became apparent in the 1980's.  The                 more skilled and educated workers continued to experience                       significant growth in real wages, while wages of the less                       educated and skilled remained the same or even declined.                        Consequently, as the average standard of living has barely                      increased in almost two decades, wage and income inequality has                 risen.  Looking at this situation form the vantage point of the                 labor market, two basic hypotheses emerge to explain this growing               income inequality.  One is that the growth of information and new               technologies and the globalization of economic activity has led                 to increased demand for a well educated and flexible work force.                The other is that there is a growing gap between desired labor                  force quality and its actual supply, and that the quality of                    worker performance may have actually deteriorated.                                                                                                              The purpose of this research is to analyze earnings inequality                  from 1967 through 1990 using micro data from the Current                        Population Survey in order to shed light on which hypotheses or                 combination explains the increase in earnings inequality.  Annual               changes in wage inequality of men will be studied by means of                   human capital analysis.  The exhaustive and computable factors in               this analysis are: (1) changes in levels and dispersion of human                capital across workers; (2) changes in rates of returns on human                capital investments; and (3) changes in dispersion of rates of                  return.  The analysis also distinguishes between effects of                     schooling and of job market investments, as well as between                     annual and life-time inequality.  A more complete understanding                 of the developments of and prospects for earnings inequality                    requires the analyses of supply responses to changes in the wage                structure and in job market investment costs.  An attempt will                  also be made to identify, directly or indirectly, obstacles to                  supply adjustments which may affect the future course of earnings               inequality.",
