 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased concern about global environmental change has focused              attention on the need to identify critical variables that can be used to        monitor shifts in the world's climate and other physical conditions.            Among the variables that scientists believe will provide accurate,              easily updated indices of changing conditions are measurements of the           extent and duration of seasonal snow cover and of the amounts of ice            within glaciers and ice caps.  This project will gather data on these           variables from a number of published sources in both the U.S. and               U.S.S.R.  Remotely sensed data also will be gathered.  Preliminary              analyses will be undertaken to ascertain how these cryospheric variables        correlate with other climatic, topographic, and land-characteristic             variables.  This research will be conducted collaboratively between             scientists at the University of Colorado-Boulder and the Institute of           Geography of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.                               This project will bring together data about snow cover and  glacial          fluctuations in addition to other related variables.  These data will           provide valuable new information with which to test hypotheses about the        degree to which cryospheric variables may be used as indices of global          environmental change.  The project also will provide tests of new means         of gathering data using remote sensors, and it will foster greater              collaboration between American and Soviet scientists with common                research interests.",
