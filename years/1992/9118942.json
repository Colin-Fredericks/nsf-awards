 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently developed electrophoretic and FPLC procedures enable                   each caroteno-chlorophyll-protein in a green plant, alga,                       cyanobacterium or photosynthetic bacterium to be purified                       without essentially displacing any pigment molecules or protein                 subunits that are present in the component in situ.  These                      procedures are to be used in the proposed research.  The specific               questions to be answered are how are the approx. 250                            chlorophyll and carotenoid molecules and their associated                       proteins, which constitute most of the antenna of photosystem                   II, organized so that they absorb and efficiently transfer                      light energy to the photochemical reaction enter.  Similarly,                   how are the approx. 150 pigment molecules in a purple bacterial                 photosystem arranged at the molecular level as well.                            %%%                                                                             The goal of the research is to contribute to basic knowledge                    about photosynthesis: specifically to energy trapping and                       migration in the antenna; antenna composition and structure;                    molecular organization of chlorophyll and carotenoid; and,                      assembly and disassembly of the photosynthetic apparatus.  The                  approach is a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and                      molecular biology studies.  Emphasis will be on those membrane                  components that contain chlorophyll and carotenoid molecules.                   These studies should  provide new information on the organization               of light-capturing proteins in diverse organisms.",
