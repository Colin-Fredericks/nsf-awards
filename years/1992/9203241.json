 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is designed to determine fundamental information on               the stability of specific algal biomarkers in the water column.                 Research questions include:  1) how do various chemical classes                 change qualitatively and quantitatively over time; 2) what is the               time frame for alteration of specific compounds as well as                      chemically defined classes of organic matter and 3) What is the                 role of microbial processes in mediating the changes by attacking               specific pools of phytoplankton carbon.                                                                                                                         This project is an integrated, multidisciplinary approach aimed at              predicting the fate of photosynthetically produced organic matter               in the marine water column.  Carefully controlled laboratory                    studies are tracking the changes in chemical composition of algal               remains (as distinct lipids, pigments, carbohydrates and amino                  acids) mediated by the microbial community.  Measurements of                    bacterial biomass, production and metabolism are being conducted in             tandem to provide degradation rates for specific relevant                       compounds.  Ongoing experiments with unialgal cultures have been                extended to include a dinoflagellate, currently receiving                       considerable attention as a major producer of organic carbon in                 coastal marine systems.  Results with unialgal communities will be              compared to mixtures of laboratory cultures and field collected                 communities whose composition can be predicted and verified.  The               research tests the hypothesis that the decay of highly labile                   species control the degradative rates for a mixed community through             enhanced microbial metabolism.",
