A learning center with 22 personal computers                   and appropriate software supports instruction in two                            introductory engineering courses.  The learning center                          laboratory is used by 36 students at a time, working with 18                    networked high-performance personal computers, in two-student                   teams.  The teams are engaged in such activities as solid                       modeling, geometric analysis, simulation, and documentation.                    The two introductory engineering courses most affected by this                  laboratory are required of all engineering students and,                        together, have a total enrollment of over 2,200 students a                      year.",
