 "awd_abstract_narration": "A theoretical study will be carried out on various phenomena in                 superfluid helium-three in which the liquid is thrown violently out             of thermal equilibrium and must then recover.  In particular, in                light of the recent discovery of Osheroff and Schiffer that a gamma             ray scource is an efficient nucleator of the first order A to B                 transition, it is planned to elaborate the \"baked Alaska\" mechanism             for nucleation of this transition by high energy electrons which                was suggested earlier and to make detailed predictions of the                   dependence of the nucleation rate on temperature and on magnetic                field.  In addition, studies are planned of the nuclear magnetic                resonance behavior in the highly supercooled A phase in low field,              with a view to obtaining previously unavailable microscopic                     parameters of the liquid.  It is also proposed to develop further               a collective model of amorphous materials for explaining the                    remarkable quantitative universlaity of the thermal and acoustic                properties of these materials at low temperatures.                              %%%                                                                             Theoretical research will be conducted in two areas for which the               Principal Investigator is the world leader: (1) research will                   continue on models for amorphous materials to explain the common                properties that occur at very low temperatures among diverse                    materials; (2) work will continue on models for the violent                     behavior of helium at very low temperatures.  This behavior has                 recently been observed and a theory, introduced earlier, will be                further developed in light of these recent and exciting                         experimental discoveries.",
