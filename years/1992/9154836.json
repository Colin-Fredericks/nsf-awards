 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is designed to establish a Science Institute                      for elementary teachers at the University of California,                        Davis, and is based on a similar NSF-funded project at U.C.                     San Diego.  The Institute will invite 75 elementary school                      teachers identified as leaders to participate in a program                      spanning a three-year period, beginning in July, 1993.                          Teams of 2-3 teachers from each participating school will                       participate each year in a 4-wk summer Institute followed by                    monthly Saturday seminars (8) during the academic year.                         During the summer institutes, participants will attend                          lectures and labs on biological science (Yr 1), earth and                       space science (Yr 2), and physical science (Yr 3); during                       the Saturday sessions of the academic year, teachers will                       work on integration of these disciplines into themes                            suggested by the California Science Framework.  Outstanding                     UCD scientist-educators will emphasize major concepts and                       principles in an interactive setting that utilizes                              demonstrations and small and large group discussion, and                        master teachers and science educators will work with                            participants in adapting exemplary curricular materials to                      correlate with the California Model Curriculum Guide and the                    California Science Framework.  Districts will be expected to                    provide support in the form of release time, space and                          materials.  Participants will be expected to act as                             resources to their schools and districts and to provide                         inservice workshops for other classroom teachers, reaching                      at least 2325 teachers in all.                                                                                                                                  This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because it will greatly enhance the science                             knowledge and teaching of lead teachers, and is designed to                     reach a large number of their colleagues as well.                                                                                                               The cost-sharing amount is approximately 16% of the amount                      requested from NSF.",
