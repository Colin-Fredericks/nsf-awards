 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will conduct a three year study of the                        systematics and taxonomy, natural history, and biogeography of the              catfishes of the genus Otocinclus.  This group of approximately 20              species belongs to one of the largest radiations of freshwater                  fishes in the Neotropics, the family Loricariidae, which includes               over 600 species.  These fishes are an important component of the               fish fauna of the Atlantic coastal region of southeast Brazil,                  which includes remnants of the Atlantic Coastal Forest and has been             identified as a region of high biodiversity under severe threat of              degradation.                                                                         Relevance of the  study of this particular group of fishes                 lies in their contribution toward understanding the complex                     historical processes which have shaped the biogeography of                      organisms inhabiting the Atlantic coastal region of Brazil.                     Several inherent biological properties, as well as previous work                on the group, lend particular significance to study of Otocinclus               for achieving these broader goals.  Representatives of this group               of fishes are presently widely distributed throughout South                     America, with one or more species occurring in every major river                drainage basin.  Their small size, coupled with low capabilities                for dispersal and wide geographic distribution, predispose them for             this kind of biogeographic analysis.  Knowledge of the                          relationships among species of Otocinclus, coupled with similar                 data for other groups of animals and plants having representatives              in the Atlantic coastal region, will provide the basic data for                 reconstructing the biogeographic history of this particular region              and seeking the common causal factors responsible for producing the             distributional properties of groups of organisms observed today.                This information can then be used to formulate conservation and                 management strategies.                                                               Despite their importance, aspects of the basic biology and                 taxonomy of these fishes are poorly known; the systematics of this              group must be revised, new species described and illustrated, their             inter-relationships determined, and present distributions defined               before progress in understanding the biogeography of the Atlantic               coastal region can be made.  Analyses of shape, coloration pattern,             and morphological characteristics will be used to determine the                 taxonomic limits to the species of Otocinclus.  Expeditions to two              poorly known areas of the Atlantic coastal and neighboring river                systems will be undertaken to sample previously undocumented                    species and to define their distributions.  General ichthyological              collections will be made and specimens deposited in major museums               in both North and South America, forming the material basis for                 continued study.  Laboratory based morphological studies will be                used to reconstruct the relationships among Otocinclus species.                 This project will then provide one additional component toward                  building a comprehensive dataset for testing competing                          biogeographic hypotheses in the Neotropical region.",
