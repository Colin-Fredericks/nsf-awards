 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a biological survey of the dynastine                 scarab beetles of Costa Rica and Panama.  Dynastines are                        prominent elements of the entomofauna as a result of their rich                 diversity, numbers and, in some instances, their size and body                  form; these are the rhinoceros or unicorn beetles of the tropics.               The subfamily Dynastinae in Costa Rica and Panama consists of 32                genera and approximately 161 species with new species awaiting                  description.                                                                         The objectives of the project are to (1) study the                         Dynastinae already residing in research collections in Costa                    Rica, Panama, and North America, (2) collect intensively in                     numerous localities and different seasons in Costa Rica and                     Panama (primarily at light traps, flight intercept traps and in                 rotting logs), (3) assemble and deposit authoritatively                         identified collections in Costa Rica, Panama, and the United                    States, (4) make available to others duplicate specimens, and (5)               publish a monographic survey of this group as it exists in Costa                Rica and Panama.  Included in the monograph will be bilingual                   identification keys to all taxa, descriptions of all taxa,                      geographic and temporal distributions, ecological and life                      history data, biogeographical data, and numerous illustrations.                      The project is significant because it will provide the first               extensive documentation on all aspects of these beetles as they                 occur in Central America.  This kind of detailed treatment of                   Dynastinae has never been done for any mainland country in Latin                America.  The study will also provide a sound taxonomic basis for               all future studies on these beetles.  Future studies dealing with               biogeography, phylogenetic inferences, and ecological                           relationships can only be accomplished with the kind of data                    gathered in this proposed survey.",
