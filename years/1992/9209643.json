 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a decapeptide that was                 isolated from brain in 1971.  This hormone is released from neurons             of the anterior basal forebrain which project through the ventral               hypothalamus to the median eminence and act upon the pituitary to               regulate the control of luteinizing hormone and follicle                        stimulating hormones.  Thus, GnRH plays a pivotal role in ovulation             and testosterone production.  However, with the development of                  sensitive and specific antibody techniques, it has now become clear             that GnRH neuronal network is a complex, heterogenous system,                   comprising three or more discrete neuronal groups and spanning                  vastly different regions of the brain. Projecting to targets within             and outside the brain, GnRH serves as both a hormone and a                      neurotransmitter, and has multiple actions, on reproductive                     physiology and on species-typical behaviors associated with                     reproduction.  Moreover, the GnRH peptides occur in at least five               different molecular forms. Dr. Muske will examine a newly                       discovered population of GnRH neurons in the periventricular areas              of the diencephalon.  Using state-of-the-art neuroanatomical                    techniques, she will identify the targets and projections of the                periventricular GnRH neurons for each of the different molecular                forms.  Dr. Muske will determine whether the periventricular GnRH               neurons constitute an unique system, with independent embryonic                 origins and developmental history.  Finally, she will assess the                functional role of this system in the regulation of reproductive                behavior and physiology.  The results will provide new insights                 into the organization, function and mechanisms of action of the                 GnRH systems lying outside the endocrine hypothalamus.  Moreover,               many reproductive dysfunctions in humans result from a disorder in              the GnRH system.  For example, Kallman's Syndrome, a congenital                 disorder characterized by sterility and anosmia, is caused by a                 defect in the migration of GnRH neurons and hypogonadism,                       characterized by delayed puberty and sterility, results from                    GnRH deficiency.  Fundamental information gained from this work may             help facilitate the development of effective treatments for                     patients suffering from GnRH dysfunctions.",
