 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds continuing investigations into two long-term  interests:  the complexity of small depth Boolean circuits, and the  computational complexity foundations of cryptography.  Computational  complexity as a field strives to provide a mathematical foundation for  computer science by developing techniques to evaluate the inherent  difficulty of computational problems.  The Boolean circuit seems the  most natural and robust concrete model of computational complexity.  Much work has gone into developing the theory of circuit complexity in  the hope of resolving such questions as P vs. NP.  There are strong  connections between bounds on circuit depth and issues in the theory  of parallel computation, logic (mostly proof theory), learning theory,  and the theory of neural nets.  Continuing projects in circuit  complexity are: establishing links between circuit bounds and Frege  proofs; examining the behavior of formulas under random restrictions,  (also known as neural nets).  Of course, circuit complexity is a  dynamic area, and specific projects may change with new results.  Work continues on the foundations of cryptography.  Recent work in  developing the structural complexity of cryptography has been so  successful that perhaps all the major, tractable questions in the area  have been resolved.  Indeed, there seem to be some theoretical  roadblocks to further progress in this direction.  However, there are  several important open questions regarding the relationship between  average-case complexity and cryptography, and that between oblivious  transfer and secret agreement.  More importantly, a large gap remains  between theory and practice.  Another goal of the project is  to develop theoretical tools that will actually lead to   implementable cryptosystems, and to handle such questions as virus   protection, secure electronic transfer of funds, and such issues   as privacy vs. security for electronic mail.",
