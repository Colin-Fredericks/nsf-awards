 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed at learning more about how coordination               problems are solved.  The analysis is motivated in part by a desire             to understand the striking, persistent patterns of discrimination               among Nash equilibria observed in some recent coordination                      experiments; these patterns varied systematically with the number               of players and the payoff function, in ways that cannot be                      explained by traditional equilibrium refinements.  The basic                    premise of the research is that, because players in coordination                games are normally uncertain about how other players will respond               to their multiplicity of equilibria, learning from experience in                repeated play is likely to play a decisive role in determining                  outcomes.  The first step is to develop a realistic but tractable               model of the learning process that shows how the dispersion of                  players' beliefs interacts with learning, using its implications                for the probability distribution of the limiting outcome (normally              one of the equilibria of the underlying coordination game) to                   explain the observed patterns of discrimination.  The ultimate goal             is to understand more generally how the number of players, the ways             in which they interact, how their payoffs are determined, and their             opportunities to communicate influence coordination outcomes.",
