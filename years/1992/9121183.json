 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a one-year collaborative project between                Professor David L. Kimbrough, Department of Geological Sciences, San            Diego State University, and Dr. Andrew J. Tulloch, New Zealand                  Geological Survey.  The scientists will carry out radiometric dating            of crystalline basement rocks of New Zealand, with a view toward                obtaining more information about geological events in New Zealand               associated with the fragmentation of the Gondwana supercontinent,               and, more generally, contributing to a better understanding of                  continental crustal evolution in the circum-Pacific region.  The                activity takes place under the U.S.-New Zealand Cooperative Science             Program.                                                                                                                                                        The researchers will measure uranium-lead (U-Pb) isotopic abundances            in the mineral zircon, a common trace constituent in the granitic               rocks to be studied here.  The zircon U-Pb method is a reliable and             widely applied technique for determining age relations of geologic              events.  It is especially useful in studying the plutonic rocks of              New Zealand, where other isotope systems in these rocks may have                been \"reset\" by thermal and hydrothermal events subsequent to the               initial crystallization of the granite bodies.  Facilities for                  carrying out U-Pb dating of minerals exist at San Diego State                   University, though not in New Zealand, and so this aspect of the                ongoing cooperation between the scientists will be carried out                  during a research visit by Dr. Tulloch to San Diego.  Funds from this           award will assist in providing for necessary materials and supplies,            as well as for undergraduate student involvement in the research.",
