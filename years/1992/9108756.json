 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports improvements to and computerization of the             Cornell University ornithology collection.  Much of the importance              of the collection lies in its age and sources and, therefore, its               record of change in habitats, species distributions, particular                 morphologies and so on since the middle 1800s as well as its                    voucher record of celebrated ornithological research (270 graduate              degrees since 1915).  The collection of 45,600 specimens (36,800                skins, 4,000 skeletons, 1500 alcoholics, 2000 egg sets, 1000                    mounts, 300 nests) is particularly strong in New York and North                 American species, with one of the best samples of hybrid zones in               the Great Plains and Mexico.  Part of the collection will be                    rehoused in new cabinets to alleviate crowding and aid                          conservation;  the entire collection will be computerized using                 MUSE, a collection database package developed at Cornell with NSF               support.  These improvements will save the collection from a nearly             orphaned status, and will make it much more accessible for research             and education in the history of ornithology and the biology of                  birds.",
