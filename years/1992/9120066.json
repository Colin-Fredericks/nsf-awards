 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unique laser-based measurements in integrated optical                           structures will be used by Professor Bohn of the University of                  Illinois-Urbana to monitor the structure of monomolecular thin                  film assemblies, in this project supported by the Analytical                    and Surface Chemistry program.  The goal of this work is to                     provide a better description of the orientational distribution                  of molecular assemblies prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett                           deposition or by self-assembly methods.  Three experimental                     approaches will be developed.  First, fluorescence anisotropy                   and linear dichroism measurements will be applied to static                     monolayers at high sensitivity.  Second, the order of the                       assembly will be characterized under dc electric field                          perturbation.  Third, the dynamic response of the thin layer                    will be examined by monitoring optical response to variable                     frequency electric field perturbations.  The waveguide optical                  probe methods developed in this project provide a unique                        structural capability for characterizing order in these                         important molecular assemblies.                                                 %%%                                                                             Determination of the degree of order in monomolecular thin                      films is the goal of this research project supported by the                     Analytical and Surface Chemistry program.  A detailed                           understanding of the structure of these thin film materials is                  crucial to the design of improved bioactive sensors and trace                   separation methods, and may impact the development of improved                  corrosion coatings.",
