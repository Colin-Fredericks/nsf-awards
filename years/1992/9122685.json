Project funding will enable Mr. Mohammed              Matoock of Cairo University the opportunity to work for 3 months in             the laboratory of Dr. Katherine Houpt at Cornell University.                    Additionally, Dr. Houpt will visit and work at Mr. Matoock's                    facilities for a two week period.  Their collaborative research                 will concentrate on the maternal behavior of Arabian horses.  The               main emphasis of the work is concerned with the intensity of                    maternal behavior in the immediate post-partum period and maternal              attentiveness in the later period of foal development.  Research                results could aid in: identifying foal-rejecting mares, developing              criteria for foal viability, and determining characteristics that               predict optimal growth rates.                                                                                                                                   This project in behavioral neuroendocrinology fulfills the program              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                 experts in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary                 talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                   interest and competence.",
