 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work supported by this award will focus on several aspects                 of the behavior of solutions to nonlinear differential equations.               The first part of the project will be concerned with solutions of               the porous medium equation in more than one space dimension.  The               Graveleau solution of this equation is a solution of a radially                 symmetric equation which is generated by an orbit of a related                  first order system of ordinary differential equations.  Solutions               of this type tend to a power of the radius; this power is often                 referred to as the anomalous exponent.  The phenomenon occurs in                many other examples as well.  Recent work suggests methods for                  calculating the precise value of the exponent.  Knowledge of this               value measures the Holder continuity of solutions.                                   A second line of research concerns the stabilization in                    higher space dimensions for porous medium flow with reaction.                   Specifically, work will be done to classify positive and negative               solutions to the equation with a cubic forcing term.  Information               about these solutions is expected to play an important role in                  the studies of the general case.                                                     Continuing work is also being carried out on superconducting               quantum interference devices which are used in many applications                as a sensitive detector of magnetic fields.  It consists of two                 coupled Josephson point junctions with a constant bias current.                 The dynamics are described by a pair of ordinary differential                   equations.  In analyzing the system one is led to a Hill equation               with three simple eigenvalues and all the rest double.  In order                to understand the stability of solutions it is necessary to                     understand how the double eigenvalues behave under perturbation.                Work is being done in seeking alternative expressions for the                   eigenvalues which may shed more light on solution behavior.",
