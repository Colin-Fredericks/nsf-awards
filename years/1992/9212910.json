 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the proposed research are 1) to investigate the               impact of mermithid parasitism on depression of mayfly host                     population size, 2) to investigate the ecological effect and the                possible source of parasite induced behavioral alterations of                   larval host behavior, and 3) to test that behavioral alterations                are caused by, rather than correlated with, parasitic infection.                Proposed methodology includes: 1) extensive field sampling to                   estimate mermithid prevalence combined with predictive mathematical             models; 2) microcosm experiments to a) quantify ecological effects              of parasite induced behavioral alterations on larval mayfly                     vulnerability to predation from stoneflies and trout, b) infer                  possible role of host nutritional stress and physical obstruction               of host internal function by parasite in producing the behavioral               alterations; and 3) the development of a laboratory culture to                  control and monitor parasite development in the larval host.  The               key contributions of this research will be 1) an understanding of               immediate and long term consequences to host fitness of parasite                infections and 2) a consideration of the evolutionary source of                 behavioral alterations, the importance of side effects of the                   infection as mediators of the alterations, and the possible                     constraints acting on the evolution of parasite induced behavioral              alterations.",
