 "awd_abstract_narration": "Very little scientific research has been conducted on the nature                of female involvement in drug selling in the United States. And,                the limited amount of research conducted to date reveals striking               inconsistencies regarding the nature and extent of female drug                  selling.  This study seeks to advance basic knowledge about female              drug selling, and address womens' roles within and between the                  formal and informal labor markets operating in inner cities.                    Focusing on two, inner city neighborhoods in New York City, the                 project explores the type of organizations they participate in,                 what they earn from participation, the role the drug economy plays              with respect to individual and family resources, the nature and                 extent of dealing-related violence and victimization, and how                   selling fits into larger careers and lifestyles.                                                                                                                To do this, the investigators conduct qualitative interviews with               150 female drug dealers.  Purposive sampling is used to select and              interview: 40 women who are active drug dealers in the community                and have little criminal justice system contact; 30 recently                    arrested female drug dealers; 40 women in jail on drug convictions;             and 40 women in state prison for drug sales.  The life histories                generated from these interviews and their contextualization in                  urban neighborhoods provide rich data on the adaptive strategies                used by some marginalized women to gain economic footholds, and                 whether economic opportunities presented by drug selling are                    diverting women from the formal labor market.  As such, this study              represents the first systematic effort to explore the consequences              of women's participation in drug dealing for family economics and               other aspects of family life.  Equally important, it provides an                explanation of women's pathways into drug dealing based on the                  combination of situational factors (e.g., involvement in other                  crime networks) and structural factors (e.g., inner city labor                  market).",
