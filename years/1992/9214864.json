 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of advance polarimetric radar techniques to                the remote sensing of precipitation is our principal research                   focus. A project named CLEOPATRA (Cloud Experiment Oberpfaffenhofen             and Transports), to be conducted by DLR and other universities and              research organizations in Germany this summer, will make available              substantial in situ and other remote sensing radar data which will              validate and enhance the microphysical interpretation of the new                polarimetric signatures such as propagation differential phase,                 copolar correlation coefficient and backscatter differential phase              that can be measured with the C-Band DLR radar. In addition, the                project will have available one FALCON jet operated by DLR, and two             vertically pointing Doppler radars which will be important for the              studies proposed herein. The FALCON aircraft will have a chaff                  release capability for the study of entrainment by tracking chaff               using the radar depolarization signature. Coordinated                           radar/aircraft datasets in a variety of summer-time convective                  precipitation of the newer polarimetric signatures (\u001aDP, \u001aHV, .) will           be studied and compared with aircraft 2D-PMS images and the                     vertically pointing Doppler data where applicable. Polarization                 transformation techniques based on covariance will be                           \"instantaneous\" scattering matrix methods which are already in                  progress will be checked by collecting further time series data                 during CLEOPATRA. We will couple our already developed Mueller                  matrix model to the DLR numerical cloud model (MESOSCOP) to study               the variation in polarimetric signatures with modelled storm                    kinematics and microphysics products.",
