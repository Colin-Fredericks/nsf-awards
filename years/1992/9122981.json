 "awd_abstract_narration": "The occurrence of facultative paedomorphosis in urodeles has been               attributed to both abiotic and biotic conditions in a variety of                species, with a few researches supporting one or both of these                  effects.  However, no previous study has determined the                         evolutionary consequences of paedomorphic individuals in terms of               lifetime reproductive success.  Determining the reproductive costs              and benefits of paedomorphosis is important to understand the                   evolution of complex life cycles such as amphibian metamorphosis.               In addition, the environmental causes of paedomorphosis in the                  proposed study organism, Ambystoma tigrinum nebulsum, are unknown.              The goal of the proposed research is to determine the evolutionary              consequences and environmental correlates of paedomorphosis in a                high-elevation population of this species.  I will investigate                  environmental effects on morph type (metamorph or paedomorph) as                well as growth rate, survival, and population density by mark and               recapture census and measuring several abiotic and biotic                       variables.  By observing breeding behavior under both natural and               experimental conditions, I will determine the frequency of                      interbreeding and male-male competition/mate choice within and                  between morphs, as well as determine if morphs differ in                        reproductive success.  The influence of larval density on offspring             morph type will be determined by rearing offspring at three                     densities.",
