 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Kansas is offering a three year teacher                       enhancement project to develop elementary teacher-leaders in                    northeast Kansas schools.  For each of three years 42                           elementary teachers will attend a three-week workshop on                        mathematics content and pedagogy consistent with the NCTM                       Curriculum and Evaluation Standards.  The workshop will be                      led by a team of university mathematicians, mathematics                         educators, and elementary teachers.  Staff will work closely                    with participants to design appropriate follow-up activities                    during the school year and will make regular site visits.  A                    workshop for principals will also be held.  Since teachers                      will be encouraged to return for a second summer, and the                       workshop designed to facilitate such participation, it is                       estimated that the project will involve directly                                approximately 100 teachers.  Cost share by school districts                     and the university is approximately 21% of the project                          budget.",
