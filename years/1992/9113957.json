 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides continuing support for a series of                   Interdisciplinary Conferences in Applied Mathematics conducted by               the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).  The                 conferences are designed to bring together mathematical scientists,             engineers, and other scientists who are developing and applying new             mathematical concepts, methods, and algorithms.  The primary                    objective of the conferences is to encourage fruitful interaction               among the creators and users of the mathematical sciences and                   thereby contribute to understanding of the mathematical sciences                and their applications to the solution of significant problems in               industry and society.  A second objective is to encourage the                   participation of students, women, and minority groups in this                   interaction.  The conferences under the previous award were                     particularly successful in this respect - nearly 18% of the                     attendees were students and 10% of the attendees were women -                   although SIAM recognizes that much more can be done in these areas.             The award supports four conferences per year for three years.",
