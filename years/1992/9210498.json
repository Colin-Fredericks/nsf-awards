 "awd_abstract_narration": "Financial support ($4,000) is requested for eight graudate students             and postdoctoral fellows to participate in this biannual meeting on             solid state chemistry.  The program includes 23 young and                       established speakers from United States and Europe.  Speakers will              discuss topics such as superconducting fullerides, microporous                  solids in catalysis, and nonlinear optics in communication.  In                 addition, the organizers will specifically ask for posters from the             graduate students, postdoc, and young faculty, and will select 8                top contributions by graduate students and postdocs for financial               support.  The chief aims are to:  1) expose future scientists to                the latest research in solid state chemistry, 2) provide a medium               for the new comers to interact with established scientists from                 academic, industrial, and government laboratories, and 3) hear a                first-hand report from Professor A. Ellis on the NSF Program in                 Solid State Chemistry for Undergraduate.  This last portion is                  focussed on the introduction of material chemistry into                         undergraduate curriculum.  The Gordon Research Conference is                    scheduled for July 27 - 31, 1992.",
