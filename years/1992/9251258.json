 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bayamon University College of Inter American University of                  Puerto Rico has adopted a new mission.  Degrees in the fields                   of electrical, industrial, mechanical and computer engineering,                 electronics and computer technologies, health-related                           professions, and telecommunications are being created and                       implemented.  Highlights of the engineering curricula will                      include up-to-date laboratory facilities, robotics courses,                     sub-specialties within each degree, cross-disciplinary                          subjects, a major in manufacturing processes within each field,                 and a pre-engineering curriculum common to all disciplines.  A                  new campus will soon be constructed to house these programs.                    This ILI project will provide funds to upgrade the computer                     sciences program, which will play a central role in all of the                  high technology curricula.  These funds will be utilized to                     purchase 32 microcomputers and associated peripherals to                        replace current outmoded and inadequate equipment with some of                  the latest computer hardware and software.  Funds are also                      provided to place all existing computers in a network, allowing                 a student to access all computer resources within campus from                   any terminal.  This upgrade in equipment is being accompanied                   by a revision in the curriculum in which emphasis is shifted                    from business to scientific applications.  Several hundred                      students will use the facilities each year.  Almost 100% of the                 students who will benefit from the project will be Puerto                       Rican.",
