 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Equatorial Pacific region is characterized by high and                      persistent levels of nitrate (N03) and low levels of                            phytoplankton biomass (as Chlorophyll), yet it has been                         hypothesized that up to 50% of the global new production may be                 generated in this large area of the ocean.  There are few modern                observations of bacterial biomass (BB) and bacterial production                 (BP) in the equatorial region. Bacterial uptake and respiration                 is by far the major sink for dissolved organic carbon (DOC),                    which is one of the largest reservoirs of freely exchangeable                   carbon on the planet.  This project is part of the US JGOFS                     process study to be conducted in the Central Equatorial Pacific                 Ocean in 1992.  In particular the proposal addresses the need for               core measurements of bacterial biomass (BB) and production (BP),                as well as particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PN) and               dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water column during the                   Time Series cruises scheduled for Northern Hemisphere spring and                fall.  On the basis of bacterial biomass and production levels in               other oceanic areas, it is hypothesized that bacterial biomass                  dominates the plankton in equatorial waters and commands a large                share of the total carbon flux. This project will investigate the               role of bacterioplankton in the euphotic zone and upper                         mesopelagic water column of the equatorial Pacific, with the                    specific objectives of examining:  (1) the depth-, time- and                    space-dependent contribution of BB to the total plankton biomass                and total POC pool, and of BP to total community production; (2)                the role of bacterial extracellular enzymes in breaking down POC,               PN and DOC; and 3) the role of bacterial activity in the turnover               of DOC.  Together with the results from other EqPac PI's and                    plankton modelling studies,  results from this project will                     contribute to a better understanding of the factors maintaining                 the paradoxical high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll condition in                     equatorial waters.",
