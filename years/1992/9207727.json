 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research on two topics in commutative                  algebra.  The first is concerned with excellent rings, formal                   fibres and the relationship between certain prime ideals of the                 generic formal fibre of an excellent local domain R and some                    birational extensions of R.  The second is related to a                         conjecture by Lech concerning the behavior of the Hilbert                       function under faithfully flat morphisms of local noetherian                    rings.                                                                               This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                    origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field                makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.",
