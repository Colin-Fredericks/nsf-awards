 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide information using interactive formats                 about current industrial quality assurance practices to two-                    year industrial and engineering technology faculty.It will                      enable them to update existing course content or initiate                       instruction in quality assurance. This activity will enhance                    the instruction of quality assurance at the two-year level and                  will also teach students about the importance of quality in an                  economic environment.  Western Carolina University and the                      American Society for Quality Control jointly  will conduct a                    year long set of activities under project auspices .The initial                 activity is a week long applications workshop involving quality                 assurance fundamentals including total quality, team problem                    solving, process study, control charts and process control                      versus product control.  This will be complemented with field                   trips and guest speakers.  During the following year,                           participants will visit several industries representing a broad                 range of manufactured products to discuss, review and gather                    data about quality assurance processes.The concluding two day                   session will emphasize participants' experiences and how these                  experiences will impact the local curriculum and students in                    specific engineering technology programs .",
