 "awd_abstract_narration": "Safety has become an increasingly important public policy                       consideration.  With enactment of the Environmental Protection                  Act and the Occupation Safety and Health Act in 19970, a healthy                and safe work place became a national goal.  The purpose of this                project is to analyze how a firm's financial performance affects                work place safety.  In particular, a model is developed showing                 how a firm's incentives for preventing accidents depends on its                 financial situation.  The possibility of bankruptcy means that                  optimal safety investments depend on such financial variables as                expected profits, debt burden, ability to sell assets, and                      expected future profits.  It is shown that it is impossible to                  determine analytically the direction and magnitude the effect                   of these factors have on investments in safety.  Answers must be                determined empirically.                                                                                                                                         This project will provide empirical estimates of the relationship               between a firm's financial condition and its investment in work                 place safety using two plant-level proxies for safety performance               form OSHA records: lost workdays and violations of safety                       standards.  This research is important because it will have                     important public policy implications, most notably for the                      efficient allocation of regulatory resources and policies towards               highly leveraged transactions.",
