 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use chess as a model system to develop and test               a theory of human perception and memory, with particular                        attention to the memory abilities of experts and the way in which               these abilities are acquired.  The study of expert memory is of                 great importance for the improvement of teaching methods in the                 schools and of training and decision-making techniques in the                   professions and the trades.                                                                                                                                     The theory will be built on the foundation of EPAM, a computer                  simulation of perceptual and memory processes that has, for                     thirty years, had remarkable success in modeling human behavior                 in a wide range of standard tasks, including expert memory,                     paired-associate and serial-anticipation learning, letter and                   word recognition, and concept attainment.  EPAM and its                         extensions have explained many salient phenomena in these realms,               including the serial position curve, the conditions for one-                    trial and incremental learning, effects of familiarity and                      similarity of stimuli on learning rates, expert memory for                      positions in chess and other games, effects of word context on                  speed of letter recognition, and others.                                                                                                                        This project will develop EPAM further to handle a variety of                   important new phenomena that have been discovered in recent years               and that are not modeled accurately by the present version of                   EPAM.  In particular, it has been found that memorization by                    experts is too rapid to be wholly explained by the short-term                   memory and chunking mechanisms in the present EPAM.  On the basis               of this experimental evidence and additional evidence that the                  project will gather, a new component of EPAM will be designed to                account for these phenomena.  The new EPAM will be capable of                   gradually acquiring in long-term memory a \"template,\" specific to               each domain of expertise, that provides a framework for rapid                   storage of large numbers of new observations.  In the case of                   chess, the template will incorporate the basic structural                       features of the chess board and processes for storing rapidly in                it information about new chess positions.  While the particular                 templates will use chess materials, the mechanisms for building                 and using them will be entirely general and hence designed to                   account for the characteristics of expert memory in any domain.                                                                                                 The main effort of the project will be devoted to building this                 extended model of perception and memory and testing it                          experimentally.  Tracking of subjects' eye movements will play an               important part in the experimental strategy.  In order to make                  the model wholly accessible to other cognitive scientists,  the                 system (currently written in an obsolete language) will be                      reprogrammed in LISP, a programming language used widely in                     cognitive science, so that copies of EPAM can be provided to                    other investigators who are studying perception and memory.",
