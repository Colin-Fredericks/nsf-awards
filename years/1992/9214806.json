 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. James Richardson, Mr. Michael                        Heckenberger will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He                will conduct approximately 18 months of fieldwork in the Upper                  Xingu region of the Brazilian Amazon. This region has been                      relatively little affected by European contact and Mr Heckenberger              will study the settlement pattern, past and present of Kuikuru                  Amerindians. In the first stage of this project he will examine                 present practices of land use. He will analyze how villages are                 spatially organized and relate this pattern to social organization.             He will then focus on individual family groups and where specific               activities are conducted. In the second phase of the research he                will use this knowledge to trace Kuikuru change over time. He will              locate and map historic villages to compare past and present                    settlement patterns. Finally he will conduct archaeological                     excavations at prehistoric sites to examine a more distant past.                                                                                                For many years anthropologists have studied tribal peoples of the               Amazon region in an attempt to understand how groups at a                       relatively simple level of technology and social organization adapt             to tropical environments. The problem these reseachers face however             is that even seemingly \"untouched\" groups have been indirectly                  exposed to Western contact for over one hundred years. Therefore it             is difficult to tell the extent to which observed patterns                      developed truly independently of outside contact. Mr.                           Heckenberger's research will help to answer this question.                                                                                                      This work is important for several reasons. It will increase our                understanding of culture contact and change. It will also assist in             the training of a promising young scientist.",
