 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to determine the three-dimensional                structure of the native intact eukaryotic flagellum and of the                  major components participating in its motion.  This will be done by             reconstruction from low dose electron micrographs of hydrated,                  unfixed, unstained, unshadowed, intact flagella, trapped in their               native state by ultra-rapid freezing in thin layers of amorphous                ice.                                                                                                                                                            Many of the movements and rearrangements that occur within cells                utlize microtubule-based motors.  Imprtant examples include the                 movement of chromosomes during cell division, and the transport of              materials from the cell body of neurons to their distant termini.               Little is known of the mechanism of any microtubule-based motile                process, even in the case of its most highly organized                          manifestation, eukaryotic flagella.   At present, the structure of              these microtubule based motors is not known well enough to suport               hypotheses about possible mechanisms.  This research will greatly               extend our knowledge of ciliary and flagellar structure and provide             an insight into the mechanisms of their movement, as well as the                structural basis for other microtubule dependent movement such as               chromosome separation and vesicle transport in nerve.",
