 "awd_abstract_narration": "The senescence of flower petals is associated with increased                    synthesis of the phytohormone ethylene, which in turn serves to                 initiate and regulate the processes of programmed cell death.  This             research aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in               the induction of ethylene synthesis, and determine how ethylene                 acts to initiate this developmental program.  The initial                       experiments have focused on identifying senescence-related mRNAs                and characterizing their temporal, spatial, and hormonal                        regulation.  Among these senescence-related transcripts are those               encoding enzymes in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway including 1-              aminocyclopropane- 1 carboxylate synthase and the ethylene forming              enzyme.  Expression of antisense RNAs of senescence-related genes               will be used to determine if these genes are essential for                      programmed cell death.  The PI will define the cis-acting elements              involved in the regulation of tissue-specific and/or ethylene-                  regulated expression of petal senscence-related genes and \u001a-                    glucuronidase and the PI will evaluate the expression of this                   reportedr gene in response to developmental factors and ethylene                in transgenic plants and transient assays.  Identification of                   regulatory sequences will allow us to screen expression libraries               of senescing petal mRNAs for clones whose products specifically                 bind to these DNA sequences.  Aside from questions concerning the               developmental biology of programmed cell death, these experiments               will identify intermediates in the signal transduction pathway                  linking initial perception of ethylene to gene expression.",
