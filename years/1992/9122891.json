 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop an instrument capable               of long-term monitoring of volcanic emissions.  Such an instrument              could be deployed at strategic locations around an active volcanic              site and left unattended for periods of up to six months to monitor             important chemical and environmental parameters.  The data would                be stored in an internal computer and periodically transmitted to               a remote observation station by telemetry.  Unattended deployment               of the instrument would greatly reduce the costs and logistical                 problems associated with repeated visits to remote sites and                    volcanologists with near-real-time data on chemical and physical                parameters, this technology will be a valuable tool for validating              models relating chemical emissions to volcanic activity.  It could              ultimately serve as an early warning system for pending eruptions.              While this technology does not currently exist, the construction                of such an instrument system is possible because of modern                      microelectronic capabilities coupled with recent advances in                    chemical sensor technology.  This was demonstrated in Phase I of                this project.  The objectives of Phase II are the design,                       fabrication, optimization, and field testing of prototype                       analyzers.  Following extensive environmental testing, the units                will be deployed in the field.",
