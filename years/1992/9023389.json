 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical question in plant population biology is how                  phenotypic plasticity affects response to natural selection to                  heterogenous environments.  A classic example of physiological                  plasticity is the production of sun or shade leaves under different             light conditions.  One particularly interesting question is whether             there is a trade.off between fitness within an environment and                  capacity for plastic response across environments.                                      In this research, the investigator proposes to examine                  physiological, morphological and life history traits in Plantain                (\u001a\u001a\u001aPlantago\u001a \u001alanceolata\u001a) to address four questions:                          . Is there genetic variation for norms of reaction within and                   between natural populations?                                                    . How does the strength and direction of natural selection on these             traits vary with light environment?                                             . What is the relationship between plasticity and fitness within                and across environments?                                                        .Is there short.term evolutionary response to microgeographic                   heterogeneity in selective pressures?                                                   The investigator will clonally replicate plants that have               experienced different selective pressures for many generations.                 These clones will be planted and subjected to different shade                   regimes.  Periodically, a variety of morphological and                          physiological measurements will be taken to examine the plants'                 physiological reactions.  These data will permit the examination                of genetic variation within and between populations for plant                   traits and for response of these traits to environmental variation.             Fecundity and survivorship will be measured to determine the                    strength and direction of natural selection on the traits of                    interest in each environment.                                                           To test the hypothesis that local variation in selective                pressures can lead to microgeographic evolutionary response,                    experimental mowing regimes will be continued for five years.  Each             year, a random sample of the seeds produced in each plot will be                grown under uniform conditions to determine whether character means             shown to be under differential phenotypic selection in the                      different treatments change in the predicted directions in                      successive offspring generations.                                                       This study will integrate ecological genetics and                       physiological ecology, and will thereby provide valuable                        information  about the genetic basis and evolutionary consequences              of phenotypic plasticity in natural populations.",
