 "awd_abstract_narration": "American manufacturers face increasing competition from abroad.                 In addition to having low prices, being competitive  requires                   outstanding quality, short lead times, and increased                            responsiveness to customer's changing demands.  Companies that                  have successfully responded to this changing environment have                   done so by decreasing work in process (WIP) and finished goods                  inventory (FGI) levels, thereby allowing early detection of                     quality problems, shorter lead times, and less vulnerability to                 changing demands.  In some situations, the kanban system has been               highly successful at reducing WIP and FGI.  However, kanban is                  applicable only to repetitive manufacturing environments.  In                   previous NSF-funded research, the investigators have developed a                more broadly applicable pull production control system, called                  CONWIP (CONstant Work in Process).  This system promises to bring               the benefits of kanban to a wider class of manufacturing                        environments.                                                                                                                                                   But a production control system cannot operate in a vacuum; it                  must be able to interface with the sales, customer service,                     quality control, product development, and capacity management                   functions.  In recognition of this, the PI's have developed a                   hierarchical planning system for a pull production control                      system, called Synchronized Production.  A version of this                      hierarchy has been designed and implemented for the case of a                   simple manufacturing environment without assembly operations.                   Although the CONWIP production control mechanism and some of its                supporting models can accomodate assembly operations, a                         consistent hierarchy for manufacturing environments with complex                assembly structures has not been developed.                                                                                                                     This project will extend the Synchronized Production hierarchy to               complex manufacturing environments with assembly operations,                    shared resources, and floating bottlenecks.  The ultimate goal is               to bring the performance benefits of pull production and the                    consistency provided by hierarchical planning to a much broader                 class of manufacturing environments.  The initial development of                the Synchronized Production concept was jointly funded by NSF and               the IBM Corporation.  IBM will continue to fund aspects of the                  research specifically related to their needs (e.g., coding of                   software for a specific implementation).  By combining industry                 and government support, this project will develop both the                      theoretical and applied results needed to enable Synchronized                   Production to play a role in restoring the competitiveness of                   American manufacturing.",
