 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mammal fossils from 14 sites distributed along the central                 Mississippi River valley from southern Missouri to northern Iowa                will be used to reconstruct paleoclimatic changes for the last 20               ka.  To accomplish this project faunal remains (ca. 4500-5000                   specimens) from seven sites will be identified and analyzed.                    Fossils from four sites have already been identified and analyzed               and data from electronic catalogs can be captured for analysis in               this study.  An additional four sites have been analyzed and                    published; their data will be encoded from the literature.                           Taphonomic investigations will assist in defining the size of              the catchment areas for the faunal samples.  Radiocarbon dates will             established absolute chronologies.  Bone dates will be based on two             amino acid fractions (proline and hydroxyproline) to insure the                 accuracy of dates and to directly date individual species of small              mammals.                                                                             Quantitative paleoclimatic reconstructions will be based upon              both Climate Space Sympatry (CSS) and Response Surface Analysis                 (RSA).  These techniques, or variations thereof, have provided                  paleoclimatic interpretations of beetles and vegetation,                        respectively.  Comparisons of these two techniques for the                      mammalian database should elucidate local and regional variations.              The mammalian RSA will be directly comparable to the pollen RSA;                therefore, it should provide another means of examining local and               regional climate patterns.  Results from this project will document             mammalian responses to global warming in the late Quaternary, but               they should also facilitate knowledge of potential affects for                  future climate change.",
