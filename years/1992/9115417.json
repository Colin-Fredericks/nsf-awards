 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researcher will develop a process control system for the               microwave joining of advanced ceramics.  Ceramics have the chemical             and physical properties necessary for advanced engines and                      industrial and chemical process systems, but brittleness and the                lack of reliable in-process methods to detect critical flaws make               manufacturing of ceramic components very difficult.  Joining is                 thus a critical technology impeding the widespread commercial use               of ceramics.  It has been demonstrated that direct heating of the               joint interface with microwave energy produces strong bonds in a                fraction of the time necessary with conventional methods.  Precise              control of the heating process is necessary to exploit this result,             because the dielectric loss factor of ceramics increases with                   temperature, leading to positive feedback and thermal runaway.                  Control over the joining process will be achieved through                       development of the following automated feedback loops:  (1) control             of the power to the (magnetron) microwave source based upon                     measurements of the surface temperature of the samples being                    joined, and subsequent calculation of the interior temperature via              solution of the thermal diffusion equation; and (2) control of the              resonant frequency of the microwave cavity applicator and the                   coupling of the microwave power to the loaded cavity based upon                 measurement of the amplitude and the rate of change of the                      reflected power.  The controllers will be based upon linearized                 models derived from numerical solutions to the coupled                          electromagnetic and thermal diffusion equations.                                     If inexpensive, reliable methods for joining ceramic can be                developed, it may be possible to manufacture ceramic components                 will tailored properties and then join them together, as is                     currently done with metals.  Such a method may greatly expand the               application of ceramics to machine components.",
