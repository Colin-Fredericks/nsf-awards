 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to adjust to changes in the external light                          environment is especially important to plant survival because,                  unlike animals, plants depend on sunlight for photosynthesis                    and they do not have a neuromuscular system which allows them                   to move to a more optimum light environment.  Plants therefore                  possess the unique light-sensing photoreceptor molecule                         phytochrome which enables them to perceive the frequent                         fluctuations of intensity, direction and spectral quality of                    light in their environment.  Experiments outlines in this                       proposal seek to provide new information on phytochrome                         structure and to address the hypothesis that phytochrome is a                   light-regulated enzyme.  The long tern goal of these studies is                 to define the structural basis for phytochrome function.  For                   a number of our studies, we will; employ the unicellular green                  alga Mesotaenium caldariorum as a model system.  Identification                 of the components of the phytochrome signal transduction                        pathway in this algal should produce useful tools for analysis                  of phytochrome response pathways in considerably more complex                   higher plant tissues.                                                           %%%                                                                             The ability to adjust to changes in the external light                          environment is especially important to plant survival because,                  unlike animals, plants depend on sunlight for photosynthesis                    and they do not have a neuromuscular system which allows them                   to move to a more optimum light environment.  This project                      focuses on phytochrome, a light-sensing protein found in all                    plants which perceives the direction, intensity and color of                    light that impinges on the plant.  Specifically, we are                         interested in how this information is received by phytochrome,                  how it passed on to other molecules, and ultimately how these                   processes lead to changes in plant growth and development (e.g.                 seed germination, flowering and growth rate). Since all life on                 earth depends on photosynthesis by green plants, a basic                        understanding of the biochemical processes which enable plants                  to adapt to their light environment is of great importance.",
