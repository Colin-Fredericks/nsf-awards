 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dinosaur bone contains many significant features including                 fibro-lamellar bone, dense vascularization, and secondary haversian             bone  Such features are found in living endotherms, and have been               cited as supporting the concept that dinosaurs were endothermic.                Recently the view has emerged that all tissue types are found in                both endotherms and ectotherms.  Specific histological types of                 bone may indicate elevated growth rate.  Combined with other                    approaches such as skeletochronology, some insight into metabolic               rate may be obtained.  Progress was made by careful investigation               of the histology of series of femora that span the ontogeny of two              Early Jurassic dinosaurs from Zimbabwe, Massospondylus carinatus                and Syntarsus rhodesiensis.  Both dinosaurs show fibrolamellar bone             but neither shows all features of living endotherms.                            Massospondylus shows growth rings that indicate it took 15 years to             attain a body size f 250 kg.  Growth rate was indeterminate as in               modern ectotherms.  In Syntarsus growth was determinate as in                   living endotherms, but it took 7 years to attain the size of 20 kg.             Each of these dinosaurs occupies a unique position on a                         physiological continuum between endothermy and ectothermy.  The                 proposed study will extend the careful techniques worked out on the             Zimbabwean dinosaurs to ontogenetic series of Triassic, Jurassic                and Cretaceous dinosaurs from North America and Mongolia in order               to obtain a phylogenetic, stratigraphic and geographic perspective              on dinosaurian growth rates and the potential development of                    endothermy.",
