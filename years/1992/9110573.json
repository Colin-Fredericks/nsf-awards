 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frequency-domain experiments (FDEs) have been considered for               experiments when errors are correlated and time-lagged responses                may exist.  Although to date the application of FDEs has been                   largely restricted to simulation meta-model identification, this                approach is appropriate in many manufacturing settings.  In much                industrial experimentation, limited equipment or operator                       availability may mandate the use of sequential data collection.                 Analysis techniques which deal with correlated errors translate                 into shorter required data collection times, as do those which                  allow for the study of time-lagged responses.                                        This research effort will combine the philosophy of robust                 product design with the methodology of frequency-domain                         experiments.  Selection approaches will then be used to identify                desirable product design configurations.  The resulting                         experimental design and analysis methodology should be highly                   suited to the automated manufacturing environment, where the                    assumptions required for traditional experimental design and                    analysis may not be applicable.  Additionally, in order to ensure               the applicability of the work and facilitate the technological                  transfer, visits will be conducted to manufacturing firms currently             employing off-line quality design or those with automated data                  collection capabilities.  These plant visits will allow the                     investigators to ascertain the issues most critical to the                      implementation of this research.",
