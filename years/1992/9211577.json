 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major objective of the research proposed is to further advance               our basic knowledge of the organization of central visual pathways,             including the optic nerve, the relationship of cell groups in the               optic chiasm to the divergence of the optic tracts, and the                     innervation of multiple central targets.  A major focus is upon two             major extratectal nuclei, the accessory optic nucleus and pretectal             nucleus lentiformis mesencephali and their interrelationship.                   These studies are relevant to understanding how the retina                      innervates multiple targets in more complex species, as well.  The              proposal addresses the following questions:  1, to what degree are              retinal axons within the optic nerve organized by morphological                 type; 2, what is the nature of the spatial transformations of                   retinal axons within the optic nerve and chiasma; 3, at what point              do retinal axons separate into fascicles bound for specific target              destinations; 4, what is the relationship of these optic fascicles              to cell groups of the hypothalamus in the immediate vicinity of the             optic chiasm; 5, how are axons arranged within each of the optic-               tract fascicles; and 6, how are the different arrangements of                   axons, i.e., retinal topography, morphological type of axon and                 central target destination interrelated?  A second major objective              is to further clarify the dual organization of the accessory optic              system and its interrelationship with the pretectal nucleus                     lentiformis mesencephali.  Ultrastructural techniques will be used              to examine central-retinal vs. peripheral-retinal innervation of                the basal optic nucleus via medial and lateral fascicles of the                 basal optic root, respectively.  An ultrastructural analysis of the             efferent projection from the accessory optic nucleus to the                     pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali is also proposed.                    %%%                                                                             For more than 50 years, the amphibian visual system has been the                focus of a broad range of investigations that have provided a major             source of knowledge about the basic organization of the vertebrate              visual system, particularly the retina and subcortical visual                   pathways.  Evolutionarily, amphibians are among the oldest                      vertebrates which possess the major retinal projections which                   occur, generally, in vertebrates.",
