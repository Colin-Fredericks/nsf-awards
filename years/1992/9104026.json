 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator plans to study problems in algebraic and                  geometric topology and algebraic K-theory.  These include                       studying K-theory parameterized by metric spaces, studying                      infinite groups acting on a sphere cross euclidean space,                       studying the L-groups of certain infinite groups, and studying                  controlled-type surgery theories.                                                    Topology arose originally as an approach to the study of                   differential equations.  Over the intervening century it has                    evolved prodigiously, often seeming to have a life entirely its                 own and independent of its source.  Increasingly, however, it has               begun to repay its debt.  The point is that it is often more                    important to know of the solution of an equation whether it is a                closed loop or whether it is knotted, for example, than to know                 precisely and numerically what are the coordinates of all its                   points.  Furthermore, although the former qualitative information               is implicitly contained in the latter complete description, it is               not at all obvious how to extract it.  The sophisticated                        machinery that has been developed by topologists, such as the                   surgery groups and algebraic K-theory which are under                           investigation in this project, has now been developed to a degree               that often permits these natural problems to be handled in a                    natural way.",
