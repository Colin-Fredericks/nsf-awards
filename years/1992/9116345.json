 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides modest funding for the continuation of the                  series of midwestern regional conferences focusing on                           developments in the theory of partial differential equations.                   The meetings, which began in 1977, are held at various                          institutions, growing in size from 60 faculty and graduate                      students to over 100 in 1990.  The conferences last two days,                   featuring two distinguished speakers from outside the area with                 approximately six other talks interspersed.  The recommendation                 to renew support is based first on the exceptional strength of                  U.S. research in partial differential equations concentrated in                 the midwest as well as on the opportunity the meetings provide to               young investigators in developing experience and acquaintances in               this thriving area at little cost.  Indeed, except for travel                   costs for the outside speakers, all of the funds will be used to                help defray expenses for graduate students and postdoctoral                     associates.//",
