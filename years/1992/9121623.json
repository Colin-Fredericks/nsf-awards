 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports basic theoretical research in                          nuclear/particle astrophysics.  One part of the project will                    study the dynamics of a QCD phase transition in the context of                  the evolution of the early universe.  Particular attention                      will be paid to the heat and baryon transport and the                           evolution of the fluid velocity field, as these will influence                  the subsequent calculation of nuclear abundances.  A second                     part deals with the weak interaction physics required for                       understanding the lepton distributions produced by supernovae                   explosions.  The shock wave re-heating problem will be studied                  together with the effects of allowing conversion between                        different types of neutrinos.                                                        The QCD quark-gluon plasma phase is a new form of matter                   predicted by our current theoretical understanding of the                       strong interaction.  It is conjectured to have existed at the                   earliest moments of the big-bang creation of the universe.                      Supernovae are the pressure cookers which produce the nuclear                   matter in the universe but their mechanisms are not fully                       understood.  The problem of neutrino conversion goes beyond                     the current theoretical framework for the weak interaction and                  is related to a critical gap in our understanding of neutrinos                  produced by the Sun.",
