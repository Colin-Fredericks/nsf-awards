 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal erosion is often related to high wave energies                     associated with storms, but it usually results from disparities                 in the coastal sediment budget introduced by longshore transport                gradients.  Erosion, therefore, affects low energy coastal                      environments as well as high energy coastal environments.  The                  rate of longshore sediment transport is an important factor in                  determining erosion along a coast, and the accurate prediction of               this rate is central to an understanding of coastline changes and               the effects of shore protection structures.  Understanding and                  prediction of longshore transport distribution across the surf                  zone requires reliable and complete field and laboratory data.                  This study will attempt to overcome many of the difficulties                    involved in mounting a comprehensive field experiment of                        longshore sediment transport by more accurately monitoring the                  variables which control sediment movement.  The study will                      evaluate longshore sediment transport theory with data from an                  estuarine beach at Fire Island National Seashore.  Its purpose is               to gather and analyze data as a basis for managing estuarine                    beaches in the Seashore, and it will identify the processes that                characterize wave energy and that cause erosion and changes in                  the beach profile.                                                                   The basic equations which describe longshore sediment                      transport are usually tested with data from beaches and from wave               tank experiments in laboratory settings.  While theoretically                   sound, the equations are usually tested with poor quality data                  from beach studies.  The accurate measurement of sand movement in               the surf zone of a beach is critical to any study of sediment                   transport.  The small dimensions and relatively low wave energies               of estuarine beaches facilitate field sampling and enhance the                  accuracy of measurements.  This project is designed to used                     specially colored sand as a tracer in order to monitor movement                 of sediment along a section of shoreline.  This controlled                      experiment should generate the necessary data to accurately test                the equations for longshore sediment transport.  The results of                 this study should strengthen our understanding of sediment                      movement along shorelines which will lead to better knowledge of                shoreline erosion rates, their possible causes, and to more                     effective strategies for preventing erosion along coastal areas.",
