 "awd_abstract_narration": "The contribution of this project comes from the development of                  semiparametric estimators for models that have not previously been              considered, as well as new estimators for models that have been                 considered in the statistical and econometric literature.  A great              deal of research in econometrics has been devoted to the                        development of semiparametric methods because these methods permit              analysts to obtain results from data even if very little is known               about the underlying processes that generated the data.                                                                                                         This project develops semi-parametric estimators for a number of                different models.  These include partially linear Tobit models,                 partially linear logit models, partially linear Poisson regression              models, partially linear duration models, and Tobit models with                 sample selection.  These estimators are defined by minimizing                   objective functions that are based on comparing all pairs of                    observations.  An investigation of the asymptotic properties of                 estimators that are defined in this way will be conducted.                      Previous research on Tobit models with fixed effects will continue.             The possibility of estimating fixed effects versions of the so-                 called Type 3 Tobit model will be addressed, and a two-step                     estimator is developed.  Software will be developed to permit                   others to use these techniques.",
