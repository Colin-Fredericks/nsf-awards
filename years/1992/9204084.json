 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the proposed program are (1) to generate                      relatively monodispersed nanoparticles containing Fe and Cr by                  laser-induced gas-phase particle formation processes, (2) to                    effectively remove particles by a surface discharge/liquid                      nitrogen electrode assembly , (3) to consolidate nanoparticles                  into nanophase composites and measure their enhanced                            magnetocaloric effect under varying external magnetic field,                    and (4) to compare the experimental data with theory for                        maximum magnetocaloric refrigerating capacity.                                                                                                                  Three techniques are used for the generation of nanometer-                      sized particles:  laser ablation, photolytic dissociation, and                  pyrolysis.  For both the laser ablation and photolytic                          dissociation experiments, excimer lasers operating in the                       ultraviolet frequency range will be used.  The reaction                         chamber configuration, gas pressure and flow patterns will be                   optimized for controlled generation of monodispersed                            nanoparticles.  The photolytic pyrolysis technique using CO2                    lasers will be developed for the eventual scale-up production                   of nanocomposite at high rates.  Using CO2 laser-induced                        pyrolytic process, the proposed new nanocomposite material may                  be prepared in large quantities for the construction of                         prototype magnetic refrigerators operating near room                            temperature.                                                                                                                                                    The creation of nanocomposite refrigerant particles by gas-                     phase nucleation processes and their consolidation into                         superparamagnetic materials with enhanced magnetic moments                      will result in significant materials with increases of the                      magnetocaloric effect.",
