Project                    funding will enable Drs. Nazife Ozdes and Ayse Kuzucu of Cukurova               University to work with Dr. Peter Schlein and his team from UCLA at             the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN (Switzerland).  Additionally,              after Drs. Ozdes and Kuzucu return to their university, members of              Schlein's team will visit them in order to continue the full                    physics analysis.  This new collaborative research effort will                  build on data compiled from a previous experiment conducted by                  Schlein's team at CERN.  These data constitute the first evidence               for diffractive production of multi-Lambda systems in ion                       collisions.  Consequently, a more detailed understanding of alpha-              alpha interactions will permit the team to extrapolate to larger                ion beams.  This project is important because ion beams can provide             a production mechanism for bound multi-Lambda systems, thereby,                 avoiding the uncertainties of production via the conjectured quark-             gluon plasma mechanism.                                                                                                                                         This project in high energy physics fulfills the program objective              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in                the United States and Turkey to combine complementary talents and               pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                  competence.",
