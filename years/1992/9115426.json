 "awd_abstract_narration": "Progress has been made in the last six years in the                             development of soft x-ray lasers.  Advances in their                            performance (wavelength range and gain) have                                    been achieved together with simplifications of the                              technology required to generate gain.  These                                    achievements have, in part, been stimulated by the                              first applications of soft x-ray lasers to soft x-ray                           microscopy and micro-holography.  The impact soft                               x-ray laster technology will have on these and other                            fields in science and industry is critically dependent                          on the cost of these lasers.  Fortunately, significant                          soft x-ray gain has been demonstrated in plasmas                                generated by relatively low energy river lasers;                                however,to date the maximum gain-length product                                 achieved in these systems has been less than                                    desired.  The PI proposes to identify the factors                               crucial to achieving high gain using novel                                      diagnostics to detect gain with unprecedented                                   sensitivity and provide a high resolution soft x-ray                            image of plasmas produced by new target                                         configurations.  In the second phase of the work,                               factors such as plasma uniformity and refraction                                critical to the achievement of high gain-length in                              extended plasmas will be identified and controlled                              in order to produce a high intensity output suitable                            for applications.  In the third year soft x-ray mirrors                         will be installed to implement a laser cavity.  In                              addition to advancing our understanding of the                                  physics issues, this research is aimed at producing a                           moderate cost table-top soft x-ray laser suitable for                           sub-optical resolution lithographic inspection and a                            variety of other applications in science and industry.",
