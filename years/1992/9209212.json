 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most demanding applications in computer vision is                 model-based 3D object recognition.  Such systems often use                      correspondence techniques to identify objects in an image; sets                 of bindings are formed between groups of scene features (e.g.,                  points, curves, surfaces, or volumes) and compatible groups of                  model features.  The discrimination ability ( or utility) of                    individual features (e.g. points, curves, surfaces, or volumes)                 and compatible groups of model features.  The discrimination                    ability (or utility) of individual feature groups in these                      systems is a challenging and important problem in computer vision               research.  When recognition systems are expected to select the                  correct model(s) out of a database of hundreds or thousands,                    indexing methods (which quickly reject a subset of the model                    database from further consideration by the system) are useful or                often essential if objects are to be recognized efficiently, and                the use of feature groups offers a promising technique for                      performing this indexing task.                                                       This research investigates two facets of the feature group                 utility concept:  saliency of feature groups extracted from the                 input image, and symmetric arrangements of features arising from                inherent symmetries of the object models in the database.                       Preliminary experimental results are also described.  Specific                  goals of the proposed research are to (a) place both the saliency               and symmetry concepts on a firm theoretical basis, (b) generalize               existing techniques for identifying salient and symmetric feature               groups out of their current domain (of polyhedral or quadric                    surfaces into more expressive and generic classes of features,                  and (c) expand a current database of over 100 object models to                  include  additional, more realistic objects.",
