 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological diversity within and among species can contain                  genetic, physical, behavioral, and cultural variation.  Most                    organisms show geographic variation of these kinds, and tolerate                a diverse array of ecological conditions.  While biological                     diversity is of interest to a broad group of people, few actually               study the geographic patterns of that variation or the processes                which give rise to it or maintain it.  The deserts of western                   North America hold an enormous amount of biological diversity, as               measured by the number of species.  The 24 species of kangaroo                  rats are one clear example of this diversity.  These seed-eating                kangaroo-shaped rodents are divisible into over 110                             geographically distinct forms.  This is based simply on their                   appearance.  Variation in genetic material, behavior, ecology,                  and life history will be studied using cytological and molecular                techniques.  A understanding of that variation and studies of the               processes which produce and maintain that variation will enable                 us to understand some of the biological diversity which comprises               our natural heritage.",
