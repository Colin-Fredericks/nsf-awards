 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this proposal is to reconstruct                        continuous, quantitative biogenic and terrigenous deposition                    records from downhole logs and core data at ODP Site 798 on the                 Oki Ridge, Sea of Japan.  We employ an innovative and efficient                 research strategy whereby continuous, multivariable log data are                calibrated using \"ground-truth\" sediment lithological information               obtained from cores.  Site 798 was the Leg 128 target for a                     complete late Neogene paleoceanographic \"reference\" section for                 this climatically-important region; however, sporatic core                      recovery precludes a solely core-based reconstruction of these                  records below ca. 1 Myr.                                                             We describe separate core-based and log-based lines of                     research whose products will be merged to reconstruct sediment                  component percentage and flux records for the last 3 Myr.                       Discrete core sections are analyzed for biogenic opal, carbonate,               organic carbon, and terrigenous percent using contiguous 30-cm                  \"channel\" samples which mimic log resolution.  Ash layers provide               accurate core-log depth correlations, and oxygen isotopic data                  are used to define glacial-interglacial stratigraphy,                           sedimentation rates, and phasing relationships.  New                            computational techniques developed by Schlumberger-Doll Research                are used to enhance the log resolution and sensitivity.  These                  and other statistical techniques are used to quantitatively                     relate specific electrical, chemical, and physical log responses                to the measured core lithological variations.  The continuous                   percentage and flux records developed from this research provide                us with an unique opportunity to: 1) Evaluate the utility of                    downhole logging methods to paleoclimate research, and 2)                       Understand the Pliocene-Pleistocene evolution of Japan Sea                      paleoceanography and paleoclimate within the context of other                   global climate records.",
