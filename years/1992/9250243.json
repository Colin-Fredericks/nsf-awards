 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will incorporate physiological instruments, data                   acquisition systems, and simulation modeling software in                        courses which emphasize whole plant physiology and                              environmental biology.  Analytical capabilities will be                         enhanced at the advanced levels and in introductory courses.                    Exercises will emphasize student directed experiments and will                  focus on complex phenomena where experiments will be guided by                  simulation models and theory.  Students will interface data                     acquisition systems and Macintosh computers with thermocouples,                 light sensors, hygrometers, and CO2 analyzers as they explore                   the mechanistic controls of photosynthesis and obtain                           calculated results on line.  A plant stress meter will assist                   students to understand the photochemical reactions of                           photosynthesis and monitor photosynthetic capabilities under a                  variety of conditions.  These complex but realistic exercises                   will be interpreted and presented by teams of students.                         Ecological studies will be helped by addition of a plant canopy                 analyzer, a porometer, a water potential system and a Hydrolab                  Surveyor 3.  Small group interactions will be fostered.",
