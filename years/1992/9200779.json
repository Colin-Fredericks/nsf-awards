 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will increase our knowledge of biodiversity in               the Amazonian rainforest ecosystem of Brazil.  The rate of                      deforestation in that area has continued to accelerate in past                  decades in response to continuing human interference.  Many                     scientists have predicted great losses in biodiversity by the                   early decades of the next century as well as significant changes                in weather patterns in response to burning and clearing forested                areas.  Yet we have relatively little knowledge of the organisms                that inhabit this great ecosystem.  Many areas remain unexplored,               and there is a great paucity of information on the systematics,                 phylogenetic relationships, and ecology of Amazonian plants and                 animals.                                                                             This proposal will focus on two groups of animals, reptiles                and amphibians, that play a vital role in the highly complex                    interactions that occur among plants and animals.  Amphibians,                  although not always conspicuous, can be among the most abundant                 organisms in a given region, providing a significant food source                for many reptiles, birds, and mammals.  By determining the                      numbers of species and the ecological relationships among these                 two groups in a given area, predictions can be made concerning                  the effects of large-scale conversions of forested areas on the                 remaining biota.  The reptile and amphibian faunas of nine sites,               adjacent to nine major river tributaries of the Amazon River and                roughly covering a circle north and south of the Amazon Riber,                  will be intensively studied.  The resulting data and specimens                  will provide answers to questions related to the biogeography,                  ecology, and systematics of these organisms.  In addition,                      tissues and voucher specimens will be deposited in Brazilian and                U.S. museums and will provide valuable material for future                      studies on systematics and on changes in distribution and                       abundance of these groups, Field guides, which currently do not                 exist for these groups of organisms in Brazil, and popular and                  scientific literature will result from this study.",
