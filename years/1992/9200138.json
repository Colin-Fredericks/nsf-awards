The REU Site is part               of the Summer Undergraduate Fellowship in Sensor Technologies                   (SUNFEST) program of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for                Sensor Technologies.  The Center provides the infrastructure for                faculty and students to collaborate, exchange ideas, co-supervise               students, and share resources.  Students are selected by a faculty              committee based on their academic potential, interest in pursuing               a research career, attitude towards graduate studies, advisors'                 recommendations, membership in underrepresented groups, and                     research opportunities in the home institution.  Special emphasis               is placed on the broader interaction and communication of these                 SUNFEST fellows with the graduate students and faculty members                  associated with the Center.  The projects suggested to the students             are chosen for their educational value, scientific merit, and the               prospects for continued involvement after the summer.",
