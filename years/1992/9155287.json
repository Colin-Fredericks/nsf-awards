The program covers optics, acoustics, and                         electricity in a series of five-week institutes conducted at                    The Bakken in Minneapolis, Minnesota, followed by a year of                     independent study by the teachers and results in graduate                       credits from the University of Minnesota.                                                                                                                       The program focus is designed to increase hands-on                              experimentation and to stress the investigative nature of the                   experiments through an historical approach.  Students will                      repeat famous discoveries using inexpensive copies of                           historical instruments and explore links between physics,                       mathematics, biology, and art.  As a follow-up to the project,                  teachers will continue to be supplied with instructional                        materials and samples of new instruments, and receive issues                    of a newsletter in which teachers share information and                         experiences.",
