 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steroid hormones profoundly influence the structure and function                of the central nervous system during development and throughout                 the vertebrates' lifespan.  While the major source of                           testosterone and estradiol comes from the gonads, the brain also                produces steroids.  Aromatase enzymes responsible for the                       metabolism of androgen into estrogen are localized within                       specific target neurons in discrete brain regions, such as the                  hypothalamus.  In some species of vertebrates, aromatase is not                 found in testes or adrenals.  Dr. Schlinger will determine                      whether the major source of circulating estrogen in these males                 is derived from aromatization of androgens in the brain.  This                  has important theoretical ramifications because the brain may not               only be a target of steroid hormones but also a major source of a               circulating steroid.  He will also examine the role of brain                    estrogen synthesis in the regulations of sex differences in brain               development and function.  To accomplish these goals, Dr.                       Schlinger will measure the amount of estrogen recovered in                      discrete brain regions, non-neural tissues and the vascular                     system following injection of androgen.  He will then identify                  the source of the androgen substrate for the brain to produce                   estrogen.  Finally, Dr. Schlinger will quantify the activity of                 aromatase enzymes and define their subcellular localization                     within neurons of the hypothalamus.  These studies will lead to                 new insights in the mechanisms underlying hormone-brain                         interactions.  Increasing our knowledge about the basic processes               underlying normal neuroendocrine events will contribute towards                 to a better understanding of birth defects that result from                     insufficient and/or excessive exposure to a particular steroid                  hormone.",
