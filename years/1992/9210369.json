 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microorganisms are key organisms in the recycling of carbon in                  ecosystems.  Not only do they recycle organic carbon produced from              photosynthesis, but they are also responsible for the                           biodegradation of man-made organic pollutants which are introduced              into the environment as a result of industrial and domestic                     wastewater discharges.  An understanding of how microorganisms                  respond to pollutant stress is key to understanding how polluted                environments function.  While pollutants may affect an environment              adversely by exerting toxic effects on the microbial population,                those microorganisms capable of degrading the pollutant in question             would be expected to increase in numbers as a result of pollutant               discharges.  DNA probe methodology will be used to address the                  dynamics of microbial adaptation to discharges organic pollutants,              using polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as models.  These                relatively new methods permit the identification of and enumeration             of microorganisms responsible for biodegradation of organic                     pollutants.  By examining the genes which code for the underlying               metabolic precesses.  Knowledge of the numbers and activities of                biodegrading microorganisms in the environment is key to designing              effective bioremediation strategies.  In this clean-up method, the              natural capabilities of microorganisms are used to remove organic               pollutants in an environmentally safe way with minimal physical                 disturbance to the environment.",
