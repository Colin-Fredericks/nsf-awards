 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last few years, the Ocean Drilling Program has                       employed a sampling strategy in which bathymetric transects are                 drilled on aseismic ridges in order to reconstruct the Cenozoic                 history of carbonate production and dissolution, and deep water                 chemistry and circulation. This strategy has evolved from similar               shallow coring programs examining late Quaternary oceanographic                 history. Carbonate accumulation in the shallowest sites of the                  depth transect approximates carbonate productivity in the                       overlying waters. If the sites are close together and only vary                 in depth, the accumulation rates will record carbonate                          dissolution which will be controlled by changes in bottom water                 chemistry.                                                                                                                                                      The objective of the present project is to acquire seismic data                 and core samples from the Ceara Rise in the western equatorial                  Atlantic. The Ceara Rise is capped by a thick section of Cenozoic               sediments and should be an ideal site for a depth transect study.               Additionally, the data to be acquired will form the basis for a                 detailed ODP drilling program which has been proposed for this                  area.",
