 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical studies will be conducted on the transport and                      thermodynamic properties of solids at low temperature focusing on               the physics of novel microstructures and semiconducting                         heterostructures.  The research will extend further our                         understanding of quantum mechanical interference effects and their              interplay with Coulomb interactions and high magnetic field in                  mesoscopic and macroscopic conductors.  Topics will include                     thermodynamic properties of mesoscopic systems in both non-                     interacting and interacting models, mesoscopic fluctuation                      phenomena in the ballistic regime and their explanation in terms of             the quantum theory of chaotic systems, and both the mesoscopic and              macroscopic properties of two-dimensional electron systems in high              magnetic field.  Calculations will be done analytically using                   impurity-averaged perturbation theory, semi-classical methods and               random matrix theory, and numerically using recursive Green                     function techniques, for instance.  The objective is to obtain a                quantitative and microscopic description of phenomena which are                 currently at the very forefront of experimental investigations and              which have important implications for future microelectronic                    technology.                                                                     %%%                                                                             Research will be done on electrical transport (current) in devices              which are of intermediate between large (macroscopic) and atomic                (microscopic) size.  This mesoscopic region is such that                        microscopic effects are seen on the macroscopic scale resulting in              unusual and useful physical phenomena.  Besides affecting our                   understanding of basic physics, these studies will have important               ramifications for microelectronics.",
