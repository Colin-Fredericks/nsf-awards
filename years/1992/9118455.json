 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                 Program continues its support of research by Dr. Daryle H.                      Busch of the Chemistry Department, University of Kansas,                        concerning the binding of O2 (dioxygen) to transition metal                     complexes.  The goal of the research is to control the                          conformation of iron(II) or cobalt(II) complexes and thus                       enable reversible dioxygen binding at a single site or at two                   or more correlated sites.  Tetradentate and pentadentate                        ligands which impose structural constraints will be used to                     iteratively synthesize complexes which may have the desired                     properties.  Specifically, the ligands tested will belong to                    one of six classes:  porphyrins, cyclidenes, alpha-dioximes, or                 one of three types of macromolecules from the Schiff base                       family.  Measurements of equilibrium constants and rate                         constants for oxygen binding and autoxidation will be used to                   assess the affinity of the site for oxygen and determine the                    mechanism of oxidation by dioxygen.                                             %%%                                                                             Transition metal complexes which can bind and carry atmospheric                 oxygen will be synthesized.  The shape of various groups                        attached to the metal will be varied in order to find ways to                   control the ease with which the oxygen molecule is attached and                 released by the metal and to prevent the oxygen from reacting                   with the metal compounds.  The chemistry of these compounds is                  relevant to understanding the binding and transport of oxygen                   in respiring organisms and to the potential development of many                 useful devices, such as fuel cells and sensors, and synthetic                   blood.",
