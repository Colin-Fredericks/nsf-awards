 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes purchasing a Perkin-Elmer X-ray Photoelectron                   Spectroscopy (XPS)  research system. The instrument consists                    of a vacuum chamber with an attached pumping system that                        incorporates ion, turbomolecular, and titanium sublimation                      pumping to achieve pressures in the 10-10 torr range. Soft                      x-rays irradiate a specimen in the vacuum chamber,  and the                     incident energy of the rays ejects electrons. If the x-rays                     only graze the surface, then the radiation is adsorbed by                       surface molecules. The energy of the emitted electrons is                       characteristic of the element emitting the radiation, and the                   bonds the element shares with neighboring atoms.                                                                                                                The PI will use the instrument in his studies on the                            relationships between interfacial microstructure  in a                          composite material and material performance. In particular,                     the PI has been investigating the synthesis of novel,                           filamentary composite materials which incorporate elastomers                    to chemically bond carbon fibers to a polymer matrix. Fibers                    are activated via radio frequency plasmas to introduce a high                   density of specific types of functional groups on the fiber                     surface. Carbon and Kevlar fibers are functionalized with OH                    and -COOH functions with O2 and O2/H2O plasmas, and with -NH2                   functions using ammonia. Di-end functionalized elastomeric                      polymers are then used to join these functionalized groups to                   an epoxy resin. The goal of this fabrication is to produce a                    composite with improved damage tolerance due to the strong                      attachment of the fiber to the resin.  The XPS research system                                                                                                  will be used to characterize the fiber surface before plasma                    treatment, after functionalization and finally after chemical                   binding.  XPS  is an ideally suited technique for  this                         chacterization because the grazing angle of the incident                        radiation can be adjusted so that the penetration or sampling                   depth is of the order of 50-100 A,  small enough to insure                      that the emitted electrons characterize surface elements.",
