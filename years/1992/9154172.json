 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of classical applied mathematics, and essentially all of                   undergraduate training in applied mathematics, is dominated by                  direct problems in which given causes evolve continuously into                  effects which are to be determined.  In recent years there has                  been a great deal of research activity in inverse problems,                     that is, problems of determining a cause of a given effect or                   a law of evolution given a cause and effect.  A three day                       regional workshop is offered to acquaint undergraduate faculty                  with some of the peculiar mathematical and computational                        difficulties associated with inverse problems and to assist                     them in developing curricular materials on aspects of inverse                   problems. Follow up activities will include a special session                   at a regional Mathematical Association of America meeting. The                  majority of the support for this workshop is being provided by                  the Division of Mathematical Sciences.",
