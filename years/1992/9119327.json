K.                              Krishnamurty, Institute of Economic Growth,                                     University of Delhi and Lawrence Klein, Department                              of Economics, University of Pennsylvania.  India has                            a long and respectable record in research work                                  related to empirical modeling and is currently                                  working on the construction of an econometric model                             that is both comprehensive and flexible, capable of                             reflecting the existing complexities of the Indian                              economy and of anticipating developments that may                               emerge in future years.  The model will be                                      maintained, revised and updated continuously and                                used in forecasting and policy analysis. It will                                consist of a core macroeconometric model having                                 components relfective of the most vital growth                                  factors in the economy, as well as four mutually                                interactive submodels for:1) agriculture, 2)                                    industry, 3) public sector, 4) foreign trade.  These                            satellite modelswill be integrated into the core                                model but capable of use in a stand alone mode.  The                            major thrust areas will be: --the strengthening of                              the segment dealing with external economic                                      relations, development of a more efficient public                               sector capable of greater surplus generation, and                               growth in agriculture which is critical for                                     satisfactory growth of the whole economy.  The model                            will use time-series data compiled by the Central                               Statistical Organisation, the Reserve Bank of India,                            and other reliable data sources in India.  The                                  proposed project will collaborate the efforts of                                Indian econometricians with researchers  at project                             LINK, University of Pennsylvania.  Project LINK is                              an international research  group that does                                      statistical studies of world trade and payments.                                National econometric models from many countries and                             regions throughout the world are installed at LINK                              as components of a total international trading                                  system.  The models are used for studying world                                 economic trends and international economic policy.                              Scope: This project will support research among                                 world class econometricians and contribute to the                               development of a long overdue economic growth model                             for India.  As a major economic power, India ranks                              high as a candidate for explicit modeling in the                                LINK context. This research will provide an                                     international perspective on economic tendencies and                            a means for assessing their impact on India.  In                                addition, a significant and well maintained model                               for India will provide a useful tool in domestic                                economic development planning.  The proposed                                    programme will be relevant for the training of young                            researchers in model building, macro-enonometric                                policy analysis, data compilation, and specialized                              computer work.                                                                  The project is being funded under two grants:                                   University of Delhi, INT9211763                                                 University of Pennsylvania, INT9119327",
