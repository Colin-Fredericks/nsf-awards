 "awd_abstract_narration": "Male reproductive processes in flowering plants occur in the                    anther.  This organ is composed of several specialized tissues                  and cell types and is responsible for producing pollen grains                   that contain the sperm cells.  Anther tissues form in an orderly                pattern from cell lineages that are present within the floral                   meristem.  These tissues differentiate from precursor cells that                appear at specific locations, or territories, within the                        developing anther primordium.  The molecular processes                          responsible for the specification of different anther cell types                after primordium initiation are not known.  Nor is it understood                how gene sets that are expressed in specific anther cell types                  are activated coordinately during anther development.                           Experiments outlined in this proposal will utilize chimeric                     cytotoxic and anticytotoxic genes to address the role of                        cell/cell interaction processes in the specification of anther                  cell types.  Other experiments will utilize molecular strategies                to identify elements of the regulatory circuitry necessary to                   activate several non-homologous genes within one anther tissue,                 the tapetum.  The significance of these experiments is that they                should provide new insight into the communication processes                     required for the differentiation of anther cell types, provide                  entry into the processes required for the differentiation of                    anther cell types, provide entry into the molecular pathways                    responsible for the specification of these cell types, and                      generate new conceptual information on the mechanisms that                      control cell-specific gene expression during plant development.",
