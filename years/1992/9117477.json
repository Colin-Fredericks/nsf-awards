 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amphibian eggs are polarized along an animal-vegetal (A-V) axis              defined by the asymmetric distribution of pigment and yolk, and by              the location of the meiotic spindles.  The A-V axis formed during               oogenesis plays an important role in the establishment of the germ              layers during later embryonic development.  Microtubules and                    microtubule organizing centers have often been implicated in                    specification of the A-V axis, though the precise mechanism remains             unknown.  The proposed experiments are designed to determine the                organization and dynamics of microtubules and microtubule                       organizing centers during oogenesis and A-V axis formation in                   Xenopus laevis.  Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy will be                 used to examine the organization of total and acetylated (non-                  dynamic) microtubules during oogenesis.  Microinjection of                      biotinylated-tubulin will be used to characterize the microtubule               assembly sites and dynamics in stage I oocytes, during A-V axis                 formation in stages III-IV, and during oocyte maturation.                       Microinjection of fluorescein-labeled tubulin and time-lapse                    confocal microscopy will be used to examine microtubule dynamics in             living stage I oocytes and during assembly and alignment of the                 meiotic spindles.  %%%                                                                                                                                          The oocyte of Xenopus laevis is a large spherical cell that                     exhibits a nonrandom distribution of cytoplasmic components early               in its development.  The mechanism that controls this                           redistribution is not known, but is significant because it                      underlies polarized growth of the embryo.  This project will                    provide important information on the roles of microtubules and                  microtubule organizing centers on the formation of the animal-                  vegetal axis of this cell.",
