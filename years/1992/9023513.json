 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal is to build a specification and analysis methodology          for safety-critical software.  Although past research included                  techniques to enhance safety throughout the software development                process, the recognition that most accidents can be traced back to              inadequate requirements and design foresight has led to concentration           on the early parts the software life cycle.  This work will build an            integrated set of software requirements and design methods and                  techniques to increase confidence in the safety of software                     requirements and design methods and techniques to increase confidence           in the safety of software that is controlling critical systems such as          aircraft and other transportation systems, medical devices, and                 nuclear power plants.  It will lead to better understanding what is             required to provide a \"safety analyst's workbench\" that would allow             software and systems engineers to build models and perform a variety            of analyses on the software requirements and design in order to                 predict and verify a wide range of software properties during                   development.                                                                    The above goals will be pursued within the context of a real, safety-           critical avionics (Collision Avoidance of TCAS) system in order to              provide a testbed to validate practicality, effectiveness, and                  feasibility as the hypotheses and ideas are generated and to keep the           research on a track toward realistic and usable results.  The testbed           approach will allow evaluation of alternatives in a realistic setting,          altering directions when necessary, and validating and demonstrating            results on a real system.",
