 "awd_abstract_narration": "The combination of benign environmental impact and tuneable                     solvent power has led to a variety of extraction/separation                     applications for supercritical carbon dioxide.  Despite these                   inherent advantages, the low solubility of highly polar or                      hydrophilic compounds in non-polar CO2 has blocked the use of                   supercritical fluid technology in areas such as protein                         purification, the remediation of heavy metal contamination,                     and non-VOC based coatings formulations, where generation of a                  highly pure and readily recoverable product would be a                          significant advance.  Recent research by other groups has                       shown that the formation of micelles in supercritical fluids                    provides a means by which low solubility of polar compounds in                  non-polar fluids can be overcome.  Despite this advance,                        formation of stable micelles in CO2 (as opposed to alkanes)                     has remained elusive, due primarily to the low solubility of                    commercially-available surfactants in carbon dioxide at                         moderate pressures.  Thus this project proposes to synthesize                   model amphiphiles where the \"hydrophobic\" tails contain                         functional groups, such as fluoroethers and silicones, which                    are known to interact favorably (in a thermodynamic sense)                      with carbon dioxide.  Preliminary results at the University of                  Pittsburgh with fluoroalkyl, fluoroether, and silicone                          materials show that this premise is indeed valid.  This                         project extends these successful preliminaries with a program                   of rational synthesis of surfactants and phase behavior                         studies.",
