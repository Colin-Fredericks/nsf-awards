 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harrell will work on the tunneling effect of quantum                       mechanics and on intermittency in equations such as those arising               in laser physics.  Other problems involve the interplay between                 geometry and analysis, and with attempts to understand nonlinear                phenomena.  Spectral theory is central to many physical problems;               for example energy levels in  quantum mechanics are determined as               eigenvalues of certain linear operators.  However, singular                     operators or limits lying outside the scope of well-established                 theories often arise in applications, and motivate much of this                 project.                                                                             Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                     product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                  last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                  and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                 electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                        foundations for these developments, collectively called                         mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                          Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,                to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                 forces into a single theory.",
