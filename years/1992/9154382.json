 "awd_abstract_narration": "9154382  Gregory    Decision Science specialists at Decision Science Research Institute  together with teachers at the Eugene (oregon) 4-J School District  are developing ten to twelve modules focussing on teaching  decision-making skills to secondary school students.  The project  focuses on decision making in science areas related to human health  and to the environment.  Students will learn to represent decision  opportunities in terms of expected consequences of different  choices and the perceived desirability of those choices.  The  material will present the four themes of decision thinking,  structuring, uncertainty and tradeoffs and show that values are  important and decision making is purposeful, there are future  events that cannot be controlled or predicted, personal choices  have an influence on future directions, and different choices  result in different benefits, risks and costs.  Instructional  modules will be developed and evaluated on the basis of their  success in encouraging better decisions as well as their ability to  enhance decision making skills in science domains.  Dissemination  will be conducted with assistance from the International Society  for Technology in Education.  ***",
