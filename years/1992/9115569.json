 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research to date has resulted in a number of significant                        findings.  (1) By means of a modified selective extraction                      technique, separate solid forms of phosphorus have been                         distinguished, and their concentrations determined, in sediments                from a number of locations, with emphasis on the Amazon Delta.                  Results indicate that previously unrecognized mechanisms for the                removal of P from seawater (as dispersed authigenic apatite and P               associated with hydrous ferric oxides) may be important on a                    global basis.  Also, differences in relative proportions of P-                  containing phases from place to place agree with independent                    geological reasoning which serves as a check on the method.  (2)                Organic phosphorus in marine sediments has been investigated in                 terms of C/P ratios and its chemical nature using 31P NMR.                      Principal forms are phosphate monoesters and diesters, and                      phosphonate compounds, the latter having been identified in                     marine sediments for the first time.  Phosphonate, where C is                   directly bonded to P, is especially important because of its                    resistance to bacterial decay.  (3) An experimental study of the                kinetics of nucleation and crystal growth of fluorapatite from                  seawater-like solution has resulted in the hypothesis that                      phosphorite in upwelling areas forms as the consequence of the                  buildup of very high concentrations (>400 uM) of interstitial                   dissolved phosphate at shallow depths.  The high concentrations                 enable the precipitation of metastable Ca-phosphate phases which                serve as necessary nucleating agents for fluorapatite                           precipitation.                                                                                                                                                  This study will be continued by (1) analyzing in detail for                     different forms of solid phosphorus in sediments from three major               rivers and their marine deltas:  the Amazon, the Yangtze (Chang-                jiang) and the Yellow (Huang-he).  (2) Extending laboratory                     precipitation studies to include the role of specific nucleating                agents, such as collagen, and the effect of changing dissolved                  carbonate levels on apatite precipitation.",
