 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central focus of this proposal is the establishment of a                    structural basis for biological recognition.  Macromolecular                    recognition between two proteins is a combinatorial process                     bought about by the collective interactions of a variety of                     amino acids on a protein surface.  Our studies are designed to                  address the issues of protein structure and the basis for                       protein-protein interaction.  Two central issues will be                        addressed within this study: 1) What effects do small molecule                  ligands have upon protein structure and, 2) What domains on a                   protein surface are most critical for protein-protein                           interaction.  Our experimental system revolves around the fatty                 acid binding protein of adipose cells, its interaction with                     fatty acid, and its phosphorylation by the insulin receptor.                    Fatty acid binding to the carrier protein allows for its                        tyrosyl phosphorylation by the insulin receptor.                                Phosphorylation of the holo fatty acid binding protein blocks                   fatty acid exchange and the release of the lipid from the                       binding domain.  Dephosphorylation of the protein by a specific                 tyrosine phosphatase allows for ligand release and returns the                  fatty acid binding protein to the basal state.  The association                 of the lipid binding protein with the insulin receptor kinase                   is thought to occur via interactions with both and acidic                       domain adjacent to the site of tyrosyl phosphorylation and a                    second domain, termed the SH2 domain, postulated to play a                      primary role in kinase recognition.  We hypothesize that by a                   combinant of molecular and structural biology we will define                    these domains in protein-protein recognition.  Specifically                     during the granting period we propose to examine molecular                      recognition by these two proteins by:                                                  1.  Determine the structure of the holo adipocyte fatty                             acid binding protein by X-ray crystallography.                                  Examine the effect of the fatty acid on tyrosine-19                             and on the SH2 domain.                                                      2.  Mutagenize the SH2 domain of ALBP. Create a dominant                            by generation of S101E, T103L and V118E. mutations.                             Examine the role of the SH2 domain in kinase                                    recognition.  Create a Y19F, dominant SH2 mutation,                             test as and inhibitor of the kinase.                                        3.  Co-crystalize the Y19F, dominant SH2 ALBP with the                              soluble kinase domain of the receptor and ATP to                                form a ternary complex.  Map the molecular                                      interaction sites between the two proteins.                                                                                                          The most significant aspects of this study will be the                          description at the molecular level how small molecules will                     affect protein structure and how that can be translated into                    differences in protein-protein recognition.  For our particular                 system we will determine how the bound fatty acid influences                    the binding protein V and how that translates into a more                       favorable interaction with the insulin receptor kinase.  Also                   we will be able, at the molecular level, to assess the relative                 contributions of acidic and SH2 domains on substrate proteins                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   in tyrosine kinase interactiolns.  In the long-term, the                        information gained here wil allow us to design specific in-situ                 tests of the role of the ALBP in lipid metabolism and its                       regulation be phosphorylation.",
