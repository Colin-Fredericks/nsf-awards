 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anticipated increases in computing power and in the resolution             of data collected through the global observational networks will                allow the use of higher resolution and more precise representation              of physical processes in models of the global general circulation.              With the greater resolution, it may no longer be necessary or                   reasonable to employ the hydrostatic approximation;  indeed, for                many purposes, explicit representation of small scale vertical                  accelerations of the flow will be required.  Experience with                    limited-area nonhydrostatic models indicates that the added                     computational load goes well beyond the increase in the number of               model grid points.                                                                   Drs. Semazzi and Scroggs will incorporate a suite of recently              developed numerical techniques, which provide greater computational             efficiency and accuracy, into a  proof-of-concept global model.                 They will assess the feasibility of using high-resolution                       nonhydrostatic computation in global forecast models.  They also                hope to learn more about the role of nonhydrostatic processes in                the global atmospheric circulation.                                               Operational numerical prediction systems of the early 20th                    century as well as various research models are likely to be quite               similar to those developed under this project.  The development of              efficient, accurate computational methods is critical.  This                    results of this project will make it possible to exploit advances               in computing and observing technology and in model development in               the future.",
