 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles is initiated from simple                      molecules and comprises few enzymatic steps.  Moreover, the pathway             for the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles is remarkably similar in all              living systems; it is initiated with the biosynthesis of 5-                     aminolevulinate (ALA).  In animals, fungi and some bacteria, the                first step of the pathway is catalyzed by ALA synthase, the enzyme              of focus of this proposal.  While ALA synthase has been recognized              as a key enzyme in heme biosynthesis since its discovery in 1958,               there has been limited opportunity to study its structure and                   function due to the inability to obtain high concentrations of                  purified, active enzyme.  The long term goal of this project is to              understand how 5-aminolevulinic acid, the first committed                       intermediate in the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, is                       synthesized in higher animals, and the mechanism by which this                  process is regulated both in liver and erythroid cells. Future                  studies projected for the next two years will utilize chemical,                 biochemical, and molecular biological approaches to overexpress the             mammalian 5-aminoevulinate synthase gene in E. coli and purify the              overexpressed enzyme in active form; and identify the pyridoxal                 phosphate binding site and active site of the 5-aminolevulinate                 synthase.                                                                       %%%                                                                             As 5-aminolevulinate synthase is the first enzyme involved in the               biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles, and the rate-limiting enzyme of the              heme biosynthetic pathway in the liver, these studies are of                    fundamental importance to the understanding of the metabolism of                hemes, chlorophylls, corrins and bile pigments.",
