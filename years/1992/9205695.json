 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediates the movement of DNA from the              Ti plasmid of the bacterium into plant cells, where the                         \"transferred DNA\" (T-DNA) is ultimately integrated into the host                genome and expressed.  Processes within the bacterium that result               in the formation of \"transfer intermediates\" have been well studied             and have led to the hypothesis that the DNA transfer process is                 similar to bacterial conjugation.  The mechanism whereby the                    transfer intermediates (composed of protein and DNA) exit the                   bacterium and enter the plant cells is virtually uncharacterized.               The virB genes of the Ti plasmid encode proteins that are                       hypothesized to form a membrane localized \"transfer apparatus\"                  through which the transferred intermediates move from the bacterium             into the plant cell.  In this renewal project, studies will be                  undertaken to continue the genetic, molecular, and biochemical                  analysis of the putative virB-encoded transfer apparatus. The                   following specific aims will be pursued.  First, the genetic                    analysis of the virB operon will be continued, taking advantage of              a recently constructed transposon that will make possible the                   construction of non-polar mutations.  It should be possible to                  determine which of the virB genes are required for virulence, and               to carry out extensive point mutagenesis on individual virB genes.              These mutants will be used in conjunction with biochemical and                  molecular strategies to study VirB related activities.  Second, the             relationship between the putative virB encoded apparatus and the                transported substrates will be characterized.  Molecular genetic                approaches will be used to test the hypothesis that pJW323 produces             an intermediate in such abundance that it outcompetes the T-complex             for access to the transport pore.  The specificity of the virB                  encoded transfer apparatus for the various transferred molecules                will be characterized.  Further, it will be determined whether                  overexpression of other vir genes affects either the transfer of                PJW323 into plants or its ability to inhibit T-DNA transfer.                    %%%                                                                             This work focusses on basic issues concerning DNA transfer from                 Agrobacterium to plant cells.  Historically, the field originated               with studies of how Agrobacterium caused Crown Gall Tumors in                   tobacco plants.  Today, the utilization of Agrobacterium as a                   vector to transfer DNA into plant cells, and, ultimately, the                   regeneration of transgenic plants from such cells, is a central                 technology in both basic and applied plant science.  The advantages             of the technique are that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is              technically simple to execute and, in many plants, occurs at                    remarkably high efficiency.  A major problem with the technique is              that, for many agriculturally important plants, it is either highly             inefficient or hasn't been shown to transform at all. Understanding             the cell biology involved in the efficient transformation of                    certain hosts may provide insight into means by which procedures                can be modified so as to transform hosts currently outside the                  useful host range of Agrobacterium.  This would be of major                     significance to agricultural research and new product development.",
