 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research into problems                 of complex function theory, concentrating on geometric ideas                    which use differential geometric tools.  The common feature in                  the investigation of all these problems is the use of conformal                 metrics, especially the hyperbolic, euclidean and spherical                     metrics.  One is interested in obtaining information about one                  conformal geometry, say hyperbolic, in terms of another conformal               (usually euclidean) geometry or in studying analytic functions                  viewed as mappings from one geometry to another.  For instance,                 from this perspective, Bloch functions are precisely those                      analytic functions from hyperbolic to euclidean geometry with                   bounded distortion.  Problems of interest include two-point                     comparison theorems for euclidean and hyperbolic geometry,                      generalized convexity-concavity properties of the hyperbolic                    metric, Bloch and linearly invariant functions, quasi-invariant                 domain constants, and a study of various conformal metrics and                  distance functions defined by families of holomorphic or harmonic               functions.                                                                           Complex function theory encompasses the study of                           differentiable functions of a complex variable and related                      classes of functions such as harmonic functions and                             quasiconformal mappings.  The subject is highly geometric; many                 of the problems concern the properties of various sets under                    transform by functions from one of the above classes.                           Applications of the theory to potential theory and fluid dynamics               are standard in engineering circles.",
