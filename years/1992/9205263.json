 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shell microstructure and ligament structures have historically             been important components of research on phylogeny and taxonomy in              the Bivalvia.  However, ligament structures, as recently redefined              by Waller (1990) and Carter (1990a), remain poorly known for many               extinct as well as extant bivalves, and data of shell                           microstructure have lagged behind other aspects of comparative                  anatomy because of the persistence of an inadequate descriptive                 nomenclature, a paucity of data for Paleozoic and Mesozoic                      families, and the lack of an accurate, comprehensive perspective                on evolutionary pathways and convergence.  Carter (1990a) recently              demonstrated that new data of subclasses Palaeotaxodonta,                       Pteriomorphia and Isofilibranchia can provide significant new                   insights into family and higher level evolutionary relationships.               The proposed research will extend this database to include the                  remaining bivalve subclasses Heteroconchia and Anomalodesmata, and              it will use the entire database for the Bivalvia in conjunction                 with published and new data of shell morphology, hinge dentition,               shell musculature, gill, palp, pedal and stomach structure, and all             other pertinent aspects of hard and soft anatomy to provide the                 first truly comprehensive, family-cladistic analysis of this entire             class.  The cladistic analyses will employ two alternative                      microcomputer programs with efficient routines for finding                      parsimonious cladograms, as well as a hybrid program, presently                 under development by Fisher (1991), which will combine some of the              salient points of conventional cladistics and stratophenetics.                  Competing parsimonious cladograms will be evaluated from the                    perspective of traditional stratophenetics.                                          In addition to providing new perspectives on evolutionary                  convergence in shell and ligament microstructure and ligament                   structure, this research is expected to resolve many important but              previously intractable questions of bivalve evolution, including                the early diversification of shell microstructure in the Bivalvia,              the origin of porcelaneous structures in the Veneroida, possible                diphyletic origins of the Crassatelloidea, the origin of the myoid              superfamilies, and the evolution of porcelaneous microstructures                and asymmetrical ligaments in the Anomalodesmata.  Additionally,                this research will provide a sound phylogenetic and taxonomic                   framework for future lower-level taxonomic studies, as well as a                basis for broader studies of evolutionary radiation and extinction.",
