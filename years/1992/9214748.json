 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                      Organometallic Chemistry Program, involves studies of                           structure-reactivity relationships in heterogeneous electron                    transfer reactions of transition metal complexes with                           particular emphasis on complexes that undergo large inner                       sphere structural changes concommitant with the electron                        transfer.  The primary objective of the work is to provide                      quantitative tests of current theories of structural and                        environmental effects on hetereogeneous electron transfer                       rates.  This will involve the measurement of accurate rates of                  heterogeneous electron transfer rates and the use of                            computational methods (molecular mechanics and both                             semiempirical and ab initio quantum mechanistic) to model the                   inner sphere barrier to the electron transfer.  A secondary                     objective is to develop methods that provide accurate                           heterogeneous rate constants.                                                   %%%                                                                             Electron transfer is one of the most fundamental of chemical                    processes about which much is known but where many issues are                   unresolved.  This project, which is a collaborative effort                      between an experimental electrochemist and a theoretical                        physical chemist, is designed to improve our understanding of                   how changes in the structures of certain metal complexes that                   accompany an electron transfer affect the rate of the overall                   process.",
