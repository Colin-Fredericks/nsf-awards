 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will investigate the policy contexts and             organizational structures within schools that influence mathematics             and science teaching, and in turn, student learning.  National                  goals for science and mathematics education call for major                      improvements in the level of student understanding and problem                  solving ability.  Two strategies for achieving these goals, as                  envisioned by many, are local school redesign and national student              assessments.  The proposed research will help fill important gaps               in the knowledge required to advance these strategies toward                    improved math and science teaching in secondary schools.                                                                                                        There are two components of the research.  The first, analyzes                  context effects on teaching and corrects a bias in prior studies of             educational effectiveness in favor of the school as the sole unit               of analysis.  The other component seeks to improve upon the NEL:88              program for assessing desired learning outcomes, especially in                  relation to teacher context effects on student understanding.  This             component will develop subscales for NELS tests that help                       distinguish teaching effects on different kinds of student                      learning.  Together these components, which build on prior work of              the researcher, promise new knowledge and recommended strategies to             support systemic reform of U.S. science and mathematics education.",
