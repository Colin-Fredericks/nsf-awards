 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is to equip teaching laboratories with                   video-imaging and recording systems for use in large-enrollment                 Introductory Biology courses and an upper-division Parasitology                 course.  This system will allow students to make class                          presentations by projecting microscopic specimens (prepared                     slide and wet mount) as well as larger scale experimental set                   ups and dissections.  Use of this video instrumentation is                      intended to:  (1) increase the participation of visually and/or                 motor impaired students by allowing them to be mainstreamed                     rather than be segregated from their classmates; (2) enhance                    class presentations by students in cooperative learning groups;                 (3) extend the instructional capability of student microscopes,                 and (4) produce videotapes and videoexams.  The goal is to                      embrace diversity in the classroom by helping disabled students                 overcome the physical barriers to hands-on learning in the lab                  and by appealing to the variety of students' learning styles                    including those who rely mainly on visual stimulation for                       information processing.  The implementation of cooperative                      learning methods is expected to enhance student learning by                     requiring students to take responsibility not only for their                    own learning, but for their group members' learning as well.",
