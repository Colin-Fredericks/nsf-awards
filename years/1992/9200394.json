 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates award will                    support eight students in a research program focusing on                        mathematical problems in graph theory.  The highly visual and                   intuitive nature of this subject makes it particularly suitable                 for students just beginning research careers.  There are many                   opportunities for algorithmic thinking, computer experimentation                and combinatorial applications.  Several graph theorists as well                as other colloquium speakers will visit during the research                     period as part of the scheduled activities.                                          Research topics include studies of how graph invariants                    determine other invariants in product graphs, T-coloring of                     graphs, separation numbers of graphs and determination of the                   orders of graph subtrees.                                                            Students are expected to have an oral presentation ready at                the end of the project.  They will be encouraged to prepare their               results for submission to research journals.  The entire group                  will attend the Pi Mu Epsilon summer meeting at Miami University.                    In addition to the principal investigator, two other faculty               and two graduate assistants will act as advisors.",
