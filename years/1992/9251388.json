 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to improve technology transfer from academics                 to industry by better preparing students to understand the                      research process and to assess the capabilities and limitations                 of emerging technologies.  In many cases, current undergraduate                 computer science curriculums do not prepare the student to                      analyze research in the field.  By immersing students in a                      research environment at school, it is believed that they will                   be able to extrapolate future trends encountered in the                         workplace.  The ability to make informed decisions is necessary                 to rapidly move research to production.  Graduates with this                    experience are expected to be able to provide thoughtful                        analysis for or against new technologies, giving their                          employers the confidence to push new technologies to the                        forefront.The funds provided by the ILI project will enable the                 institution to launch a research oriented curriculum. The                       machines, terminals and CASE software provided will provide                     students with the same facilities used by faculty researchers.                  Students will be guided through a curriculum designed to teach                  them to perform research support for faculty members and/or to                  perform independent research.  First, students will be                          introduced to large scale coding and documentation techniques                   in a software engineering course.  This will be followed by an                  introduction to one or more research areas providing some in-                   depth knowledge.  The experience will be completed with a                       senior research seminar course in which the student is allowed                  to do independent research or become involved in a faculty                      member's research by implementing theoretical results.",
