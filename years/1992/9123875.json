 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Lewis Binford, Mr. Russell Greaves                   will collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  He will study                 the Pume, a group of horticulturalists and hunter gatherers who                 live in southwestern Venezuela.  His research will focus on how                 the Pume make and use tools for subsistence activities. To do                   this, he will follow the process from the collection of raw                     materials through manufacture and subsequent use and discard.  In               particular, he is interested in the time tradeoffs involved                     between tool manufacture and other activities such as                           subsistence.  He will collect data in a number of ways.                         Randomized time allocation studies will be conducted.  He will                  also follow individuals and groups on subsistence trips and                     record the time spent in different activities.  He will also note               what tools are taken, how they are used and how patterns may                    change based on the goal of the expedition, the number of                       participants and the distance traveled.                                                                                                                         Although this study is ethnographic, the significance is                        primarily archaeological.  Because they are virtually                           indestructible, stone tools are found in most paleolithic sites -               often they are the only material recovered - and archaeologists                 of necessity focus strongly on their interpretation.  On the                    basis of these often difficult-to-understand remains,                           prehistorians attempt to reconstruct diverse cultural attributes                such as group size and movement patterns and they have developed                many theories about how tools and behavior are related.  The                    problem is that very little empirical data support many of these                observations and Mr. Greaves research is designed to address this               problem.                                                                                                                                                        This project is important for several reasons. It will help to                  provide analytic methods of general archaeological use.  It will                shed new light on a traditional South American group and will                   assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
