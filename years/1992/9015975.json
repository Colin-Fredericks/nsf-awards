 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurements of the auroral ionosphere using a digital                     research-ionosonde co-located with EISCAT near Tromso Norway                    provide the content and orientation of the proposed work.  Data                 acquisition and analysis were accomplished (1983-1989) by the                   investigator during a stipendium with the Max-Planck Institut fur               Aeronomie, followed by a research consultancy at the British                    Antarctic Survey.  The seven papers now to be written will join                 four already published, or accepted, which have resulted from prior             work.  Two papers present a new method for deriving ionospheric                 vector velocities from high resolution Doppler and echolocation                 analyses and undertaking their comparison with EISCAT bulk ion-                 velocity measurements.  Three papers are concerned with new                     achievements in the development of data acquisition principles for              digital ionosondes.  They show progress toward a better                         understanding of the interplay of the processes of radio                        reflection, refraction, diffraction and dispersion in controlling               the information content of ionosonde echoes.  One paper                         demonstrates two new methods for the spatial representation of                  ionospheric soundings.  Two papers are concerned with natural                   (Joule) and artificial (radio) heating of the auroral ionosphere.",
