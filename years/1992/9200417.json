 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue a successful Research                     Experiences for Undergraduates program at The Whitney Laboratory,               a research institute of the University of Florida, located on the               Atlantic Coast.  The program provides research training for                     undergraduates in cell and neurobiology using marine animals.  Ten              faculty members will train students throughout the year in modern,              experimental techniques of anatomy, biochemistry, molecular                     biology, pharmacology, toxicology and electrophysiology, for which              the facility is exceptionally well equipped.  Students are                      recruited nationwide and special efforts are made to attract women              and minority students.  The students live on the campus of the                  Laboratory, have access to all facilities, and become full partners             in the ongoing research efforts of their faculty advisors.  Student             independence will be encouraged, and they will receive full credit              for their work in publications.  In addition to their practical                 research training, the students' intellectual growth will be                    stimulated through participation in the Laboratory's regular                    seminar series, a special student seminar series and research                   tutorials and discussions provided by each member of the faculty.",
