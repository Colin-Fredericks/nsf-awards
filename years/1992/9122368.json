 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study the how participation in political             activism and social movements affects people's decisions about                  work, education, marriage, and childbearing.  All applicants to the             1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer Project will be compared to a                   matched comparison group.  The investigators propose to update the              life histories of participants in the Freedom Summer Project                    previously surveyed in 1988, to obtain comparable life-course data              for a sample of individuals who did not participate in the Freedom              Summer Project, and to develop and administer a questionnaire                   focusing on the subjective dimensions of the relationship between               political activism and the life course.  One of the central                     questions in the study will be how participation in social                      movements such as the Freedom Summer Project have influenced life               choices and career trajectories.  An equally important question                 will be to understand how and why major life events such as                     marriage and childbearing often serve to constrain political                    activism.                                                                                                                                                            This project will contribute to our understanding of the                   interrelations between political activism and the life course, and              it will also provide insights into the life patterns of a cohort of             people who lived through young adulthood during the turbulent                   decade of the 1960s.",
