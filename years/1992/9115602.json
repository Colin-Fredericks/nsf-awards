 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Some Research Problems on Hydrogen in Planetary Upper                          Atmospheres and the Interplanetary/Interstellar Medium\"                         Superficially the common thread to the various problems described               in this proposal is \"hydrogen at low density\", but actually these               problems are the outgrowth of ones that have occupied the P.I. in               one form or another throughout his research career of over 40                   years.  We expect to be absorbed with the first two problems in                 the first year of the grant; we will turn our attention to the                  3rd and 4th problems in the second and third years, as progress                 with the first two and the subsequent availability of time                      permit.                                                                         All the problems deal with matter at very low densities: the                    upper atmospheres of planets, exospheres and magnetospheres, and                interplanetary/interstellar space.  The problems are all                        theoretical in nature; to the extent that computational data                    analysis is required, we have an IBM PS/2 (an 80386 machine with                a 387 math coprocessor) for our exclusive use when required.  In                addition, should more powerful computers be needed, we have ready               access to Sun workstations, an Apollo DN10000,  and a DEC                       Microvax II, all within the Department of Space Physics and                     Astronomy.  Also the Rice University computing center has a                     mainframe IBM 3090.
