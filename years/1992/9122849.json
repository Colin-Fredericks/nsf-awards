This meeting is convened once every four years and is                 the largest international conference regularly held in the field                of Cell Biology. Funding is sought for scientists from the U.S. to              attend this meeting. The meeting provides a valuable forum for cell             biologists from different countries to meet, to discuss their                   research, and to initiate or cultivate research collaborations that             extend beyond national boundaries.                                                                                                                              Support is sought for U.S. scientists to attend the Fifth                       International Congress on Cell Biology. The meeting is to be held               in Madrid, Spain, from July 26th through July 31st, 1992. The                   meeting provides a valuable service in that it enables cell                     biologists from around the world to meet and discuss their                      research. It also can serve as a stepping stone for the initiation              of international research collaborations. The meeting is convened               once every four years, and is the largest international conference              that is regularly scheduled in the area of Cell Biology.",
