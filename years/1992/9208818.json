 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues research on theoretical and applied                 problems involving functional and partial differential equations.               Work will be done investigating the stability and Hopf                          bifurcation problems for a general class of functional                          differential equations with state-dependent bounded delay.                      Another line of study concerns singularly perturbed nonlinear                   differential difference equations where the goal is to show the                 existence of a pulse-like periodic solutions.  Several problems                 involving the existence of distributional solutions of classes of               partial differential equations.  Closer to immediate                            applications, work will be done on the dynamics of population                   models.  It includes a generalization of Volterra's population                  equation to include spatially distributed population and delay in               the birth process.  Models for disease transmission of sexually                 transmitted diseases will also be analyzed.  Here the additional                element in the model incorporates risk-behavior change.                              Differential equations form the backbone of mathematical                   modeling in the biological sciences.  Phenomena which involve                   continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials and                    energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                         expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                only to state the relationships, but also to extract qualitative                and quantitative meaning from them.",
