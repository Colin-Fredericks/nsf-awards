 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Great Lakes Research Consortium (GLRC) proposes to immerse                  20 undergraduate faculty in a 3-week summer practicum that                      demonstrates environmental problem-solving as an effective                      teaching strategy to stimulate undergraduates' interest in                      environmental science.  Participating faculty will learn                        environmental analysis techniques and prepare environmental                     impact statements for a hypothetical development project in a                   contaminated harbor of Lake Ontario.  As they are being exposed                 to new theoretical concepts and techniques developed by the                     Great Lakes Research community to understand and solve                          environmental problems.  Participants will be shown how to                      integrate environmental problem-solving into curricula at their                 home institutions.  Through preparation of environmental impact                 statements for a realistic project, these techniques will be                    integrated into the overall environmental analysis and problem                  solving approach that has stimulated undergraduate interest in                  science at two GLRC campuses for a decade.  Participants in the                 practicum will return to their home institutions with expanded                  and updated professional skills and new strategies and                          techniques for improving undergraduate education, and                           addressing environmental problems in local communities.",
