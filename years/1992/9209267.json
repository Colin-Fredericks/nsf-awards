 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study how human capital externalities lead                    individuals to coalesce into groups and will show that this self-               partitioning sheds light on a number of important issues: economic              segregation, the effectiveness and costs of education, the                      organization of cities, ghettos, labor productivity and long term               growth.  The project consists of three parts.                                                                                                                   The first one will develop a model of a city composed of several                communities, formalizing the links between residential choice,                  skills acquisition, and overall productivity.  It will show how                 local externalities in human capital investment induce self-                    segregation by occupation, and how this affects the composition of              the labor force.  In particular it can lead other areas to drop out             of the labor force and become unproductive \"ghettos.\"  The analysis             will show that underemployment is more extensive, the easier it is              for high-skilled workers to isolate themselves from others, but                 that at the same time their attempts to do so may be self-                      defeating.                                                                                                                                                      The second part will extend the analysis to two other issues                    concerning the structure and productivity of cities.  The first is              the value of local diversity in land uses and its tendency to self-             destruct under market pressures.  The second is the recent exodus               of firms, hence jobs and taxes, out of central cities into suburbs,             and its implications for employment and income distribution.                                                                                                    The third part will study the implications of group formation for               long term macroeconomic growth.  It will add to recent models of                endogenous growth by recognizing that individuals can choose the                group from which they receive human capital spillovers (school,                 neighborhood, city, state), although at a price: land and other                 rents on non-reproducible factors reflect the quality of the                    externality which group membership confers.",
