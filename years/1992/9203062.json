 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore several basic algorithmic questions                   in symbolic algebraic computation and investigate their                         applications to geometric modeling.  The overall goal of the                    project is to design, analyze and test efficient algorithms                     for solving systems of polynomial equations and related                         problems, and to test their applicability to geometric                          modeling problems.  The specific problem areas to be studied                    are: analysis of algorithms for solving system of polynomial                    equations such as the Wu-Ritt characteristic set algorithm and                  Lazard's triangular set algorithm; developing variations of                     these and other algorithms to efficiently handle systems of                     polynomial equation of special interest; designing efficient                    new algorithms based on Grobner bases and a new basis                           conversion algorithm for manipulation of polynomial ideals;                     investigation of the properties of the general Dixon resultant                  and algorithms for computing it; and exploration of the use of                  these techniques in solving algorithmic problems in geometric                   modeling.  The design and analysis of the various algorithms                    will be accompanied by experimentation with trial                               implementations on existing computer algebra systems.  The aim                  of the experimentation will be to incorporate possible                          improvements suggested by the analysis and to uncover                           phenomena that might possibly be missed out in the analysis.                    Fine tuned implementations of a few special purpose algorithms                  are also planned.",
