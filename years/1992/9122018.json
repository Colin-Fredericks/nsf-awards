 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mendel         In many practical signal processing problems, information is  often represented in two forms: one is a set of input-output data  pairs, obtained by measuring the outputs of the system for some  typical input signals; and, the other is a set of linguistic  descriptions about the system, often in the form of IF-THEN fuzzy  rules, from human experts who are very familiar with the behavior  of the system. This research is developing a general method to  combine both numerical input/output pairs and linguistic IF-THEN  rules into signal processing system design within the framework  of fuzzy system theory.  The objectives are to:  1.     theoretically justify the practical successes of fuzzy  systems;   2.     develop synthesis methods for fuzzy systems which use both  numerical and linguistic information; and  3.     apply these synthesis methods to signal processing problems,  such as time-series prediction, and subject these methods to  theoretical performance analyses.   An optimal design method for fuzzy systems which will match given  input-output pairs to arbitrary accuracy is also being developed.",
