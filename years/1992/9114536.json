 "awd_abstract_narration": "The flow of molecularly well-characterized polymer liquids in                                                                                                   a wavy channel will be investigated quantitatively and in                       considerable local detail.  This model geometry provides a                      complexity of flow approaching that encountered in the                          commercial processing of polymer materials, and yet also                        allows the effects of non-Newtonian behavior on the stress and                                                                                                  velocity fields to be determined by non-invasive optical                        techniques.  An apparatus to accomplish this was developed and                                                                                                  tested under a previous grant (CBT-88-19660).  The use of                       nearly-monodisperse model polymers will now allow comparisons                                                                                                   with the predictions of constitutive equations based on                         molecular theory.  Researchers at Exxon Corporate Laboratories                                                                                                  will participate in the work, supplying the model materials                     and collaborating in characterization, analysis and                             interpretation of results.                                                                                                                                      Viscoelastic effects dominate the flow behavior of polymers in                                                                                                  many commercial processing operations.  Viscoelastic                            properties also depend strongly, and essentially universally,                                                                                                   on the large scale molecular architecture (molecular weight,                    distribution, branching) of the polymer.  Molecular theories                    can now successfully account for many of these architectural                    effects, but are still relatively untested, even for                            qualitative                                                                     guidance, in the complex flow histories that typify a real                      processing situation.  This research will supply such tests                     with model materials, allowing thereby a direct contact with                    the predictions of molecular theory.  It will also provide a                    detailed body of information (the velocity and stress fields)                                                                                                   for use in testing the computational methods of non-Newtonian                                                                                                   fluid mechanics.  The purposeful design of polymeric                            architecture (e.g., molecular weight distribution) for                          optimal processing behavior and for final product properties                    is a long-time goal throughout the polymer industry.                            Differences in behavior frequently correlate with differences                                                                                                   in architecture, but molecular theories of polymer rheology                     are still untested in processing flow regimes.  Moreover,                       detailed data for evaluating the computational methods of non-                                                                                                  Newtonian fluid mechanics are very limited even for commercial                                                                                                  polymers, where the architecture is uncertain and where                         molecular                                                                       theories to account for the effects of molecular weight                         distribution are only now being developed.  The wavy-wall                       study, utilizing model materials, offers a way to close some                    of these gaps in the connections between molecular                              architecture and the processing behavior of polymers.",
