 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Clark Erickson will                study prehistoric agricultural systems of the Llanos de Mojos of                northeastern Bolivia. This region, part of the vast upper Amazon                drainage basin, is one of the largest areas of seasonally inundated             grassland savanna in the world, covering some 145,000 square                    kilometers. During the rainy season of 4-6 months the area is                   inundated and the alteration of marked wet and dry seasons and the              waterlogged and heavy soils have a significant impact on                        contemporary land use patterns. Past indigenous populations                     developed a complex system of massive earthworks to solve the                   problems of water control and agriculture. Dr. Erickson will                    attempt to reconstruct how this worked. To accomplish this he will              conduct a number of activities. Aerial photographs and ground                   survey will be employed to locate the most extensive and best                   preserved raised field complexes and canal-causeway networks.                   Accurate topographic maps will also be made. With this as a basis               key agricultural structures will be excavated. Long stratigraphic               trenches will be dug perpendicular to raised fields causeways and               canals to determine their original profiles, individual building                stages, post-depositional erosional history, and chronology of use              and abandonment. In situ materials will serve both to date and                  determine how fields were constructed and used.                                                                                                                 This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new                light on the prehistory of a little known area of the world and                 produce data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also help              to devise subsistence strategies which will be of direct use in                 many regions. In some tropical areas prehistoric population                     exceeded its modern counterpart. This most likely is due to the use             of appropriate technologies which have since been lost. Dr.                     Erickson will help to recover them.",
