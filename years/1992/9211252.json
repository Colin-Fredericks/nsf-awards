 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical studies of secondary metabollities from fungal                         sclerotia will be studied.  Sclerotia are key physiological                     structures vital to the survival and propagation of many fungal                 species.  Ecological considerations and circumstantial evidence                 suggest that sclerotia may contain new antiinsectan metabolites                 not found in other fungal tissues.  The occurrence of                           sclerotial metabolites that deter feeding by fungivorous                        insects would be very significant to fungal chemical ecology.                   Sclerotial extracts will be tested for effects against both                     ecologically relevant and agriculturally important insects.  A                  pool of antiinsectan extracts is already available.  Active                     metabolites will be isolated by chromatographic methods, and                    identified using modern spectroscopic techniques.  Experiments                  will be performed to determine whether these compounds are                      concentrated in the sclerotia.  Investigations will also be                     extended to include related fungal bodies (i.e., ascostromata).                 These studies will provide insight into fundamentally                           significant, rarely-studied aspects of fungal secondary                         metabolism, and will permit further exploration of this unique                  source of new antiinsectan natural products.                                    %%                                                                              With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                 research of Dr. James B. Gloer at the University of Iowa.  Dr.                  Gloer will focus his research on a specialized tissue structure                 of fungi, the sclerotia, as a source of new natural products                    that may have antiinsectan activity.  This has the potential to                 benefit research in biochemistry and agriculture as well as in                  the chemical industry.",
