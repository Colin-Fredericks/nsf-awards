 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to build a High-Performance Computing and                       Software Laboratory in the Division of Mathematics, Computer                    Science, and Statistics at the University of Texas at San                       Antonio (UTSA).  This facility will support a variety of                        educational and research projects investigating both the                        fundamental nature of high-performance computing and its                        application to problems of importance in software engineering.                  Through the supporting laboratory facilities and different                      upper-division classes, students will be given an understanding                 of high performance computing, training in use of appropriate                   machines, and an experimental environment in which to conduct                   research in high-performance computing.  A variety of systems                   will be studied including vector and multiprocessor                             supercomputers, such as the CRAY Y-MP (computing time is                        provided by the University of Texas System), different MIMD                     multiprocessor systems, such as the Intel iPSC HyperCube,                       Sequent Symmetry (computer time is provided by the Center for                   Research on Parallel Computing at Rice University), the BBN                     GP1000 at UTSA, and high-performance workstations.  The project                 will concentrate on three important areas:  1) solving                          numerical problems in scientific applications by using high-                    performance computing systems;  2) measuring and evaluating                     performance of scientific computing on high-performance                         computing systems;  and 3) monitoring and visualizing the                       performance.  The laboratory facilities will support courses                    and research in numerical computation, visualization, software                  development and will encourage interdisciplinary work between                   computer science students and students from other fields of                     science and engineering.",
