 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Martin E. Newcomb at Wayne State                   University.  A number of very fast organic radical reactions will               be studied including second order radical trapping reactions that               approach the rate of diffusion in low viscosity solvents and first              order rearrangements of highly reactive radicals that have                      lifetimes at room temperature as short as several picoseconds.  An              indirect kinetic method for determining rate constants of carbon-               centered radical rearrangements which has been reported will be                 further developed such that it will have an ultimate kinetic                    resolution at room temperature of about one picosecond and will be              useful even when direct kinetic studies are not possible.  The                  indirect method will be extended to decarboxylations of acyloxy                 radicals and reactions of nitrogen-centered radicals.  Fast                     rearrangements of aryl-substituted cyclopropyl-carbinyl radicals,               substituted 5-hexenyl radicals and the cubylcarbinyl radical will               be fully characterized.  Applications of radical rearrangements in              mechanistic studies of iron-containing enzymes and their models                 will be initiated.  A direct laser-flash kinetic method will also               be utilized to study decarboxylations of acyloxy radicals as well               as rearrangements of carbon- and nitrogen-centered radicals.                    %%%                                                                             Organic radicals, neutral species with an odd number of electrons,              will be studied.  These reactive species will be generated by                   thermolysis of stable precursor molecules.  An indirect method of               determining the rates of reactions of the radicals will be                      developed.  This new rate measurement method will allow                         examinations of reactions of carbon and nitrogen containing                     radicals which were previously too rapid to study conveniently.                 Application of this new technology to examine iron-containing                   enzymes and their models will be initiated.  The results are                    expected to provide valuable information that can be used in a wide             variety of organic and biological reactions that involve radical                intermediates.",
