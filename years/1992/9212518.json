 "awd_abstract_narration": "This equipment grant will be used for acquisition of a laser                    diagnostics imaging system for research important to                            development of better understanding and modeling of turbulent                   combustion.  This system, which employs an intensified CCD                      camera and an aberration-corrected monochromator in a two-                      dimensional multiplexed detection scheme to simultaneously                      detect spectral and spatial information, greatly reduces data                   acquisition time for characterization of strained laminar                       flames by enabling the acquisition of simultaneous spectra at                   multiple locations in such  flames, removing the need for                       spatial scanning.                                                                                                                                               This imaging equipment will play a key role in a comprehensive                  program to construct and test \"libraries\" of experimentally                     measured properties of strained laminar flamelets for use in                    turbulent combustion modeling and engine simulations.  Such                     data is currently being collected using non-intrusive laser                     diagnostics to measure spatially resolved temperature,                          velocity, and species concentration profiles in well-                           controlled counterflowing premixed diffusion flames; however,                   the current research is hampered by the massive amount of data                  required for each \"library\" and the time required to obtain                     it. (For a given fuel, measurements are required for a wide                     range of strain rates, pressures, temperatures, and                             equivalence ratios.)  This improvement will make possible the                   construction of experimental laminar flamelet libraries for                     accurate modeling of turbulent combustion of realistic fuels                    for which kinetic schemes are not yet available.",
