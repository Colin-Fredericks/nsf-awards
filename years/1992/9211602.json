 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this project is to delineate the                    shallow (upper 300 m) subsurface structural configuration within                the Manson Impact Structure (MIS), Iowa, using state-of-the-art                 high resolution seismic imaging techniques.  The MIS is a bollide               impact feature 65.7 Ma in age, and is an important candidate for                a source of the Cretaceous/Tertiary-boundary iridium anomaly.  The              feature may thus have played a central role in one of the best                  documented examples of mass extinction due to global change in                  geological history.                                                                                                                                                  A detailed knowledge of the structure, stratigraphy, and                   petrology of the MIS is needed as basic data for the construction               of a model of the impact dynamics.  However, the exact geometry                 within the structure is poorly known due to a 30-90 m thick                     Pleistocene till cover.  Seismic reflection lines will provide a                direct image of the structure and gross stratigraphy of the impact              feature, and will constrain stratigraphic and petrological                      interpretations inferred from drilling transects, at least in the               vicinity beneath the seismic lines.                                                                                                                                  The major seismic line is along an east-west radius of the                 crater, from the central peak structure to the undisturbed                      stratigraphic section outside the crater.  In addition to                       delineating the general structure of the central uplift, moat and               ring graben, specific objectives include locating the presence (or              absence) of faults, defining the depth and extent of the peak pit,              and resolving the internal geometry of the impact breccia and melt              zones at the edge of the central uplift.                                                                                                                             This study will provide fundamental geologic knowledge to                  contribute to an understanding of the global change in the                      biosphere that may have occurred, at least in part, as a direct                 result of the bollide impact at Manson.  The seismic data will                  greatly enhance the interpretation of all data sets acquired as a               result of the Manson drilling program, and will constrain the                   shallow subsurface structure and stratigraphy, allowing more                    accurate models of impact dynamics to be constructed.  The seismic              reflection data will help to identify targets for future drilling               and for subsequent detailed surface geophysical studies such as                 electromagnetic, magnetic, and microgravity surveys by others.",
