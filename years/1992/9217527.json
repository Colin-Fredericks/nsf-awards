 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant to conduct a workshop composed of NSF grantees                  whose awards were made in the new area of inter-disciplinary                    research known as Coordination Theory and Collaboration                         Technology (CTCT).  The purposes of the workshop are:  First, to                provide a forum for the exchange of knowledge in the form of                    perspectives, findings, methods and theory for this young,                      interdisciplinary field.  Second, to provide an opportunity for                 the field to coalesce and grow.  While certain subsets of the                   community of the researchers mingle at various professional                     meetings, as a whole, these investigators do not have regular                   contact.  Third, this provides an opportunity for the research                  from these projects to be made more visible to the Washington                   based research funding and policy community.  This workshop                     represents a planning opportunity for the IT&O Program.  The                    future research agenda for CT2 funding and community building is                an important part of the workshop program.  The workshop is held                on July 8 through July 10, 1992 in Washington, DC.  A workshop                  report will be prepared and made available through publications                 and in response to requests.",
