These techniques will enable precise definition                                 of regions with similar or dissimilar temporal                                  patterns with respect to a reference pixel or                                   reference ROI (region of interest).  Different                                  similarity measures (correlation coefficient,                                   covariance, Tanimoto coefficient, etc.) will be                                 tested on sequences of image ROI's (regions                                     of interest) of various sized and spacings.  The                                computational effectiveness of each similarity                                  measure will also be evaluated.                                                 In addition, a method for automatic selection                                   of reference ROIs will be designed and tested                                   based on a new idea for maximum entropy                                         histogramming.  All of the ideas will be tested                                 by (1) mathematical modeling, (2) application                                   to earth resources imagery, (3) application to                                  medical imagery.                                                                The significance of this research is that these                                 new methods are of great importance in                                          dynamic image analysis due to the enormous                                      size of the data base to be processed.  For                                     example, a single spectral component of                                         Landsat imagery taken of a single region on                                     the surface of the earth over 10 years is                                       composed of about three billion data points                                     (pixels).  Clearly, extremely efficient                                         computational techniques are necessary to                                       analyze dynamic temporal changes and they                                       will have a potential use as a research tool in                                 quantitative imaging.  Fortunately, the                                         segmentation techniques developed for time                                      series analysis of one type of image data can                                   be employed for time series segmentation of                                     other type of image data.  For example, the                                     techniques developed for satellite image                                        sequences can be used for analyzing medical                                     data, and vice versa.                                                           The results obtained in this study will lead                                    into a long term goal of establishing models                                    and techniques for the study of temporal                                        behavior of imaged structures and improve our                                   ability to extract quantitative information                                     contained in dynamic images.",
