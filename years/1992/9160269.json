 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compared to current technology, the required refrigerators                      must be more compact and reliable, require no maintenance or                    skill to operate, achieve much longer operating lifetimes, and                                                                                                  pump up to several watts of heat, yet cost only a fraction of                   the rest of the electronic system.  These objectives are not                    achieved in practice due to mechanical, thermal, and fluid                      flow irreversibilities which are inherent in conventional                       design, materials, and manufacturing processes.  Through                        silicon micromachining, fundamentally lossy mechanical                          components can be eliminated and special materials properties                   can be exploited, while thermal and fluid flow contributions                    to entropy generation can be controlled.  Under current NSF                     SGER funding the P.I. designed an experimental apparatus.  The                                                                                                  construction of this apparatus is the goal for Phase I.                         Successful results will provide a foundation for the                            engineering of Stirling microrefrigerators, that will expand                    its range of applications for cold electronics.                                                                                                                 Stirling microfrigerators would increase the speed of computer                                                                                                  processors and memories; and reduce noise in radio and                          microwave detectors, amplifiers, and filters; reduce the bulk                   of infra-red detection and imaging systems; and facilitate the                                                                                                  commercialization of high Tc superconducting electronics.",
