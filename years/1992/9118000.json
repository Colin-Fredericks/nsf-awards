 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cretaceous (Campanian) depositional sequences in the Mesaverde             escarpment of the southern Big Horn Basin (Wyoming) appear to have              been deposited at 100,000 year intervals.  Studies of several                   sections suggest that despite their high frequency nature, the                  sequences contain elements of sequence architecture, including                  transgressive surfaces (ravinements), flooding surfaces, thin                   onlapping (transgressive) deposits, and downlapping (regressive)                deposits. This hypothesis will be investigated by 1) collecting                 field data, 2) constraining numerical simulations against the field             data, and 3) returning to the field to check model predictions                  against the field evidence.  In step 1, strata thicknesses and                  grain sizes in these sequences will be measured along a series of               30 meter sections along shore-normal and shore-parallel transects.              In step 2, the data will be used to modify and extend existing                  numerical models for facies and sequence formation.  Existing                   techniques for 1-D forward modeling of stratal successions will be              extended.  Depositional systems (lithofacies assemblages) will be               simulated in 2 dimensions by \"chaining\" 1-D synthetic stratigraphic             columns.  Cyclic sedimentation (\"parasequence stacking\") will be                simulated by varying basin parameters such as water depth and                   sedimentation rate.  In step 3, predictions of the models will be               compared against further field studies.",
