 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is use the evidence of                   buried soils to understand the habitat of one of the best known                 early fossil apes called Proconsul some 17 million years old from               Rusinga Island, Kenya.  Proconsul belonged to an archaic group of               monkey-apes (proconsulids) widely considered ancestral to both                  the great apes and to early human ancestors                                     (australiopithecines).  The fossil apes are found along with                    other mammal fossils in soils buried within a sequence of river                 deposits.  Some of the fossils are delicate skulls and                          articulated limbs that could not have been transported far from                 where the animals lived.  Of the various kinds of soils buried                  within these stream deposits, Proconsul is consistently found in                one kind of buried soil.  The microscopic and chemical studies of               this proposal are aimed at determining exactly what kinds of                    soils these were when they formed, and thus where in the mosaic                 of vegetation Proconsul                                                         lived.",
