 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of photoelectrochemistry.  During                 the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Bard and              his students will pursue fundamental investigations of                          electrochemical and photoelectrochemical reactions at the                       semiconductor/liquid interface.  Three specific                                 photoelectrochemical research thrusts will be pursued, namely (1)               the preparation, characterization, and study of quantum particles               and films of cadmium (II) and iron (IV) sulfides; (2) studies of                the influence of semiconductor surface structure on                             photoelectrochemical efficiency using scanning tunneling                        microscopy and tunneling spectroscopy techniques; and (3)                       preparation of new semiconductor materials by photodeposition of                metals on semiconductor single crystal, polycrystalline film, and               particle surfaces and by chemical vapor deposition and homogeneous              synthetic routes.                                                               %%%                                                                             This research builds upon results obtained under Dr. Bard's                     previous NSF grant, CHE-8805865.  In addition to providing                      fundamental insights into the processes that occur at the                       semiconductor/liquid interface, this research is of particular                  interest in the application of semiconductor-based systems for the              utilization of solar energy in such areas as the production of                  useful chemicals and the destruction of wastes.",
