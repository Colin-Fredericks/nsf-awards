 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a continuation of mathematical research                into problems associated with holomorphic functions and mappings                in the theory of several complex variables.  In addition to                     function theoretic methods, the work exploits the deep                          connections of the subject with partial differential equations.                      Among the most challenging open questions in several complex               variables is that of understanding the orthogonal projection of                 functions (with finite quadratic norm) defined on a domain in the               space of several complex variables onto the subspace of                         holomorphic functions.  This is known as the Bergman projection.                The primary goal is to determine when the projection preserves                  differentiability up to the boundary.  A number of solutions have               been determined under various finiteness conditions on the                      domain.  The current work will pursue a line of investigation                   involving the construction of special vector fields which has led               to a broad class of results.  The ultimate goal is to use these                 techniques to establish a general theory of regularity on domains               of infinite type.  The continuity of the Bergman projection and                 the related d-bar Neumann operator in spaces other than quadratic               Sobolev spaces will also be studied.                                                 Since the Bergman projections are not always regular, there                is a need to determine obstructions to regularity as well as                    conditions for its presence.  It is known that the topology of                  the set of points of infinite type is not sufficient to give                    complete information about obstructions.  Some potential-                       theoretic condition on the d-bar Neumann operator must be found                 to combine with any topological conditions.",
