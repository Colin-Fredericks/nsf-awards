 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biologists since Darwin have sought to understand how extreme male              display traits function.  Among species with exaggerated male                   display, bowerbirds are especially well suited for analysis because             (1) their unique display allows experimental manipulation of                    display components, (2) patterns of display differ greatly in                   closely related species, and (3) they are one of the few kinds of               animals for which the details of female choice are well known.                                                                                                  Dr. Borgia will develop a biochemical phylogeny of bowerbirds based             on comparisons of mitochondrial DNA.  In the field, he will observe             display and experimentally manipulate conditions under which it                 occurs for four species.  This comparative information can be used              (1) to reconstruct the historical sequence by which complex display             traits evolved and (2) to carry out novel tests of hypotheses about             the operation of female choice.                                                                                                                                 This project is the first attempt to use comparisons within a group             of related species to evaluate recent models for the evolution of               female choice and extreme male display.  This study should help                 provide critical information for developing a general model for                 mate-choice patterns in animals.  Such knowledge can have important             economic applications in species preservation, pest control, game               management, and animal breeding.",
