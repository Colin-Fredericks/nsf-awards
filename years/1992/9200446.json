 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                 metallic Chemistry Program, will involve studies of con-                        formational gating, and electronic coupling between redox                       centers through hydrogen bonds, in electron transfer reactions.                 The effects of second coordination sphere interactions between                  ruthenium(II) ammine complexes and complexation agents on                       electron transfer reactions with Ru(III) oxidants will be used                  as the model for conformational effects that may be involve in                  electron transfers in biopolymers.  In the second case,                         electron transfer between Ru(II) and Co(III) through hydrogen                   bonds will be examined.  Stopped flow spectroscopic and                         rotating disk voltammetric measurements will be used in the                     study of these reactions.  Detection of hydrogen bonded                         Ru(II)/Ru(III) mixed valence dimers will be attempted using                     electronic, NMR and FTIR spectroscopies.                                        %%%                                                                             Electron transfer is one of the most important processes in                     biological systems but many questions remain concerning the                     mechanisms of these electron transfers.  In addition to in                      vitro studies of the actual biological molecules, which are                     frequently very difficult to interpret, studies of model                        systems that are designed to simulate one aspect of the                         biological process can be especially helpful in determining                     what structural and electronic features of the biological                       system have significant effects on reaction rates.  This                        project, to be pursued by undergraduate scholars, will examine                  two of the factors that are believed to affect the rates of                     electron transfer in certain biological molecules.  The first                   is the ability of hydrogen bonds to serve as conduits for                       electron transfer between donor and acceptor, in this case                      between two transition metal centers.  There is accumulating                    evidence that suggests that electron transfer may be coincident                 with, or preceeded by, a change in the structure of a protein                   that surrounds the electron donor or acceptor.  A model has                     also been designed to probe this concept, again based on                        reactions between two transition metal complex ions.  Studies                   such as these may ultimately result in better treatment of                      certain physiological disorders and new methods solar energy                    conversion based on models of biological systems.",
