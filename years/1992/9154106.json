 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hughes Aircraft Company is contributing up to $15M and a                        corporate platform to develop the Hughes GALAXY Classroom                       (SM) targeted for educationally at-risk children in our                         nation's elementary schools.  It is a systematic program to                     strengthen curriculum through the development of video-based                    supplementary educational materials distributed,                                unscrambled, via a dedicated satellite interactive network                      without commercial advertising.  Hughes GALAXY Classroom                        (SM) includes integrated classroom activities and materials                     and a strong enhancement program for teachers,                                  administrators, and parents.                                                                                                                                    The three-year demonstration will include two 13-part                           science video programs (closed captioned, Spanish track) for                    grades K-2 and 3-5 and comparable programs for English-                         language arts, broadcast to 37 representative urban and                         rural elementary schools (and one in Mexico), reaching 190                      classrooms and teachers and 6,000 students.  Also, included                     will be hands-on science curriculum materials and                               substantial formative and independent summative evaluations.                                                                                                    The following operational phase will provide an expanded                        curriculum with a goal of 20,000 schools by the year 2000,                      supported by public and private funding sources.                                                                                                                A prestigious eight-member Science Advisory Board will guide                    the Project.",
