Shilo, member of the Presidium and Councillor to the                      President of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Science, to visit Dr.                      Patricia Anderson at the University of Washington-Seattle                       and Dr. Paul Colinvaux at the University of Ohio-Columbus                       to discuss the possibility of initiating a new research                         program on the paleoclimatic and paleovegetational history                      of the northern Urals and Novaya Zemlaya Island.  He would                      also be able to participate in a small workshop to be held                      in Seattle on \"Paleoclimates of Beringia\" with the group                        involved in cooperative research since 1989 that included                       pollen and geochemical analysis of lake sediments                               collected on two field expeditions.                                                                                                                             The Soviets expect to sponsor an American team in 1991 to                       core lakes in the northern Urals, an area with little                           knowledge of the past climate or vegetation.  That would                        complement the ongoing project in the Soviet North East.                                                                                                        This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine                                   complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                       mutual interest and competence in the field of basic                            scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,                      and mutuality of benefit.",
