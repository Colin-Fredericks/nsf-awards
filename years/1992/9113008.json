 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is collaborative with David D. Yao of Columbia                University.  The principal investigators developed the notions of               strong stochastic convexity and directional convexity which are                 sample-path based structural properties essential to the analysis               and optimal design of stochastic discrete event systems in general              and queueing networks in particular.  This project focuses on                   properties relating to structural and policy changes in queueing                networks.  To model and understand these changes, notions of                    monotonicity and convexity do not apply directly.  New concepts and             new machineries along the lines of stochastic rearrangement and                 stochastic majorization will be developed.  These notions provide               mathematical support for \"pairwise interchange\" arguments that are              widely used in scheduling, control, and resource allocation.                    Preliminary studies have demonstrated their usefulness and                      effectiveness in dealing with structural and policy changes.                    Furthermore, these properties are natural extension of stochastic               convexity.                                                                           A new, unified hierarchy of (sample-path based) second-order               properties in queueing networks appears to be now emerging.                     Together, these properties will support the (static) parametric                 design of queueing networks, and dynamic scheduling and control.",
