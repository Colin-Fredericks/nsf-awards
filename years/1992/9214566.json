 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds for the purchase of a scanning                     electron microscope and an x-ray microanalysis system.  The                     Electron Microscopy Center at North Dakota State University                     is a common instrument facility that provides the only                          access  to electron microscopy on campus.  There are usually                    between 70 and 90 research scientists and students that use                     the facility each year.  In addition to maintaining the                         equipment, the laboratory offers a complete line of service.                                                                                                    In the last few years, food technologists and cereal                            chemists have discovered the need for ultrastructural data.                     Many samples such as doughs and glutens are particularly                        difficult to prepare for scanning electron microscopy.  It                      is well documented that the preparation procedures employed                     for biological specimens result in significant artifact                         formation.  Cryo-preparation and examination of frozen,                         fully hydrated doughs and glutens yield the best data.                          Specimen charging is a serious problem with the present                         scanning microscope as it is not generally possible to                          obtain secondary images at accelerating voltages of less                        than 8kV.    To meet the present research requirements of                       these scientists and to simulate continued ultrastructural                      studies of  foods, the acquisition of  the equipment listed                     in this proposal is essential.",
