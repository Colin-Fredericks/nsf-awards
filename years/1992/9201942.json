 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall aim of this research project is to define the molecular             mechanisms involved in iron-mediated regulation of gene expression              in Escherichia coli, using the complex genetic system encoding                  components responsible for the biosynthesis (ent), transport (fep)              and iron removal (fes) this 22 kb gene cluster is now                           characterized; the six ent biosynthesis genes, fes five fep                     transport genes, and three genes of unknown function are arranged               as four polycistronic and two monocistronic operons, the expression             of which are controlled by three bidirectional promoter operation               regions that interact with the repressor molecule, Fe(II)-Fur.  The             objectives of the current study are: (i) to continue the molecular              analysis of nucleotide sequences required for iron-controlled                   expression of ent-fep region genes and the interaction of these                 sequences with Fur and other regulatory factors; (ii) to continue               examination of the role of untranslated leader regions of some of               the mRNAs in the ultimate expression of these genes; and (iii) to               investigate the regulation, localization and potential function of              the fepE gene product, a membrane protein of as yet unknown                     function.  In this last aim, we will pursue whether this protein,               along with the products of the two other uncharacterized ent region             genes (P43 and P15), function to control ent-fep gene expression in             response to environmental fluctuations.                                         %%%                                                                             These studies will provide a molecular model for iron-mediated                  control of enterobactin gene expression as complex metabolic                    pathway requiring coordination between biosynthetic and transport               components.  In addition, they will provide a foundation for                    initiating a molecular investigation of the complex metabolic and               regulatory interrelationships between the iron (Fur) region and                 other global stress response systems",
