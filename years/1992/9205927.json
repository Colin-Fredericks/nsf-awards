 "awd_abstract_narration": "Existing data show that the initial phases of inactivation of                   serine hydrolase enzymes by organophosphorus compounds resemble                 those of acylation.  The thesis of this proposal is that the                    characteristic differences between carbon and phosphorus in                     valence and electronic structure dominate the ensuing                           processes.  An investigation of these later phases, the                         stabilizing forces in the adducts and the dynamics of their                     decomposition can reveal much about the scope of the catalytic                  potential of serine hydrolases and how enzyme regeneration might                be promoted over aging.  Reversible phosphonate ester                           inhibitors of serine hydrolases might be used as blocking                       agents in pretreatment against soman and sarin.                                 The specific goal of this project is the modeling of                            interactions between fully hydrated trypsin, chymotrypsin or                    acetylcholinesterase and organophosphorus inhibitors: 2-propyl                  and pinacolyl methyphosphonofluoridates, 4-nitrophenyl 4-                       substituted-phenacyl methylphosphonates.  Charge distribution                   will be calculated with program MNDO and nonbonded interactions                 will be evaluated in the course of adduct formation and in the                  diastereomeric adducts by molecular graphics and molecular                      mechanics calculations using program YETI.  The effect of                       positive charge on His-57, when each N is protonated, will also                 be studies as a potential stabilizing factor in the serine                      hydrolase-organophosphate adducts.  Isotopic probes and NMR                     measurements will also be employed for the study of the                         mechanism of the general acid and base catalyzed aging                          reactions.  These and results of previous investigations of the                 kinetics of phosphonylation dephosphonylation and enzymic                       dealkylation in the phosphonate ester adducts will then be                      correlated with calculated energies and geometries in the                       adducts.  The factors promoting dephosphonylation and disfavor                  aging will then be assessed.                                                    %%%                                                                             The results of this experiment will contribute to an                            understanding of the stereochemical outcome of serine protease                  phosphonylation, thereby furthering knowledge regarding the                     modes of interaction at the catalytic site.  From the practical                 point of view, if one could learn the key elements involved in                  the stability and dynamic of adducts, one could promote                         dephosphonylation at will and thereby design inhibitors with                    controlled reversibility.  Ideas of this kind can find use in                   medical application and in protein synthesis by molecular                       engineering.",
