 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the purchase of a two-axis rotary table that             will be installed on a three-axis vertical milling machine, giving              the machine tool a total of five Computer Numerical Control (CNC)               axis.  This degree of complexity will enable the researchers to                 evaluate several research projects, currently in progress, in a                 real world mode of operation.  All these research efforts are aimed             at enhancing the accuracy capability of complex-contour machining               by developing new and improved interpolators and servo-system                   architecture.  The equipment is also intended to be used for                    undergraduate education, specifically in the area of \"Computer                  Control of Manufacturing Systems.\"                                                   Enhancing the accuracy of contour machining of complex                     surfaces is of major significance to wide variety of manufacturing              industries for the purpose of improving the performance of their                products.  This work is also of great significance to the domestic              industry from a competitive perspective.",
