 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ferns are ideal for evolutionary and developmental studies.             Molecular studies tracing fern evolution are especially important               because there is a paucity of morphological characters for use in               systematic studies and taxonomists disagree about the unity of some             traits.  In this research, the investigator will study the                      organization of the genomes in several fern families.  Genome                   rearrangements are valuable for determining linkage at higher                   orders of taxonomic classification where comparisons of restriction             site mutations are precluded because the genetic distance is too                great.  It is likely that one could trace the evolution of the                  rearrangements by finding representatives that are immediate                    between the primitive fern \u001aOsmunda\u001a and the higher ferns.                              The investigator will collect and analyze the old world tree            ferns for chloroplast DNA mutations and compare these results to                data on new world tree ferns.  One current hypothesis,  which has               some support from angiosperm studies, is that species from the old              and new worlds that look alike differ more than different species               which are in close proximity to each other.  The study described                would address this issue.                                                               Ferns also offer several potentially valuable features for              studying gene regulation.  The haploid generation is a small, fully             independent plant that grows from a single cell (the spore) and can             be bisexual.  Unlike flowering plants, self fertilization produces              a diploid plant that is 100% homozygous in one generation.                      Transformation of the spore will allow the investigator to generate             plants homozygous for the introduced trait.  The particular genes               that will be examined are male determining genes.  Spores of                    certain species that are sown in the presence of the hormone                    antheridiogen germinate to produce a male haploid plant.  This                  suggests that a different gene(s) is activated in response to this              hormone than when the spore is sown without the hormone and in                  isolation from other gametophytes.  Subtraction hybridization will              be used to enrich for specific messages related to these two                    different developmental pathways.",
