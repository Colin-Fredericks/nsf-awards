 "awd_abstract_narration": "This a comprehensive study of shale meso- and microfabrics on              a suite of shale units from a variety of climates and basin types.              All shale units contain a wide range of sedimentary environments                from terrestrial to basinal.  The units under study were selected               on the basis of good stratigraphic control and prior                            sedimentological studies.  Shale fabrics represent the cumulative               record of the history of transport, deposition, and burial of these             fine-grained rocks.                                                                  There is presently a severe deficiency of comprehensive                    petrographic and sedimentological case studies of shale units, and              the environmental significance of shale fabric features is still                poorly understood.  Comparing the full range of meso- and                       microfabric features from equivalent sedimentary environments in                a suite of well studied shale units will allow us to identify                   environmentally significant features (or combinations thereof), and             to filter out local factors (due to climate, biological control,                basin type etc.).                                                                    Data from this study will benefit efforts of fabric                        classification, will establish correlations between mesofabric and              microfabric features, will probably lead to the recognition of                  environmentally specific fabric associations and relate fabric                  features to basic processes, and will ultimately lead to                        considerable refinements in basin analysis studies.",
