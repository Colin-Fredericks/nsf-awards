 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Glenn Evans is supported by a grant from the                          Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study                        structure and dynamics of simple model systems for                              liquid crystalline fluids.  For simplicity, the liquid                          crystalline forming molecules are envisioned as hard                            nonspherical bodies encircled with a spherical (square well)                    potential.  The proposed analysis of equilibrium phenomena                      are concerned with the derivation of phase diagrams for                         nematic and smectic phases, fluid mixtures and chiral                           nematics.  Elements of density functional theory, Onsager                       theory and scaled particle theory are combined to                               analyze the origin of these phases at high liquid densities.                    The dynamical properties to be addressed include: the self                      diffusion coefficient, the dielectric permittivity and the                      NMR spectral density for a single component nematic fluid.                      %%%                                                                             Liquid crystals were discovered roughly one hundred years                       ago.  They are materials with flow properties of a liquid                       and the optical properties of a solid.  Since that time,                        these optical and fluid properties of LCs have been                             harnessed into display technology.  The molecular physics                       underpinning the development of LCs is nontrivial.  Liquid                      crystal displays are typically made from mixtures of chiral                     nematic phases with unusual optical and viscoelastic                            properties.  The richness of the technological applications of                  these phases is in turn directly linked to the diversity of                     their thermodynamic and transport properties which are the                      subject of Professor Evans studies.",
