 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research, we explore traffic control algorithms for                integrated- services networks. which are networks that carry                    diverse traffic types such as computer data, voice, video, text,                and images.  ln such a network performance objectives and packet                arrival processes vary tremendously from one data stream to                     another.  Either networks must be designed with so much capacity                that every conceivable set of performance objectives will be met,               or algorithms are needed that differentiate packets and packet                  streams based on these characteristics and adjust delay                         distributions, loss  probabilities, and blocking probabilities                  accordingly.  We plan to develop an integrated set of traffic                   control algorithms based in part on a novel mechanism called the                priority token bank.  An admission control  algorithm admits or                 blocks entire packet streams, where admitting a packet stream                   means guaranteeing its performance objectives will be met. In                   each queue, a scheduling  algorithm orders the transmission of                  queued packets and a dropping  algorithm selects packets to be                  discarded when buffer overflow occurs.  Both algorithms                         effectively adjust delay distributions and loss probabilities to                optimize performance at a given load as perceived by the                        applications, or,  equivalently, to achieve a given level of                    performance at a higher load. We also explore usage-based charges               for network services based on the packet arrival processes of                   admitted packet streams and on  the corresponding performance                   achieved (and possibly guaranteed). These charges reflect the                   extent to which network resources are consumed. Policing and                    monitoring are also addressed. Algorithms  are evaluated through                analysis and extensive simulation by comparing delays, loss                     probabilities, blocking probabilities, and other relevant                       metrics, with those achieved with known algorithms.",
