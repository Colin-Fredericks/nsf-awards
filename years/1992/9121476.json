 "awd_abstract_narration": "An examination of the history of the development of quantum                     mechanics in the early part of the present century shows the                    essential influence both of factors usually taken to be \"internal\"              to science (such as logical consistency, empirical adequacy,                    fertility and the like) and of \"external\" ones (such as                         professional rivalries and prior metaphysical commitments of some               of the major scientists).  Neither class of factors alone can                   explain why the \"Copenhagen\" interpretation of quantum mechanics,               with its ineliminable indeterminism at the level of microprocesses,             was chosen by the consensus of the scientific community to the                  virtual exclusion of an equally empirically adequate and fertile                causal version of quantum mechanics in which one has the                        deterministic, continuous and picturable evolution of microsystems              in a space-time background.  Professor Cushing argues that there                exists a possible, and in fact plausible, temporal reordering of                certain highly contingent events in the actual historical record                that could have resulted in the acceptance of a deterministic,                  causal quantum theory to the exclusion of the present \"Copenhagen\"              orthodoxy of inherent indeterminism.  In this research project,                 Professor Cushing is exploring the ramifications of the existence               of a viable rival to the accepted position in science and the                   failure of science to explore this alternative.  He argues that                 this raises practical as opposed to just in-principle problems of               the underdetermination of accepted scientific theories by an                    empirical basis and questions of the reliability of the knowledge               with which science provides.",
