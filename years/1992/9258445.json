 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modeling and analytical studies will be carried out for                         turbulent combustion systems.  Included in these studies will                   be efforts directed at development of better understanding of                   fundamental mixing processes.  This research will be carried                    out in two basic stages: (1) An analytical study to shed light                  on the dependency of time evolution of chemical composition as                  a function of the mixing parameters governing various systems                   of interest; (2) A model development and implementation effort                  to apply new ideas in turbulent mixing modeling to full scale                   combustion systems.  In this activity, the turbulent mixing                     and reaction processes will initially be modeled based on                       ideas developed in prior formulation of a linear eddy model,                    the only current model formulation that allows for distinction                  between the effects of molecular diffusion and turbulent                        stirring at the smallest turbulent scale of the flow; such a                    distinction is required for accurate prediction of the small-                   scale mixing which governs turbulent combustion processes.  An                  advanced formulation which can be used in industrial                            combustion applications will be pursued.  Part of the research                  project will be devoted to implementation of such models and                    resulting computer codes on massively parallel computing                        machines.                                                                                                                                                       Energy conservation and environmental protection issues                         provide a strong impetus for development of cleaner, more                       efficient combustion processes.  Since most combustion occurs                   in a turbulent environment and it is the turbulent mixing that                  governs the overall combustor performance in most cases, it is                  very important that turbulent mixing and combustion be treated                  in a more comprehensive manner than in the past.  As part of                    this program, models will be applied to realistic combustion                    chemistries for analysis of energy production and pollutant                     formation.",
