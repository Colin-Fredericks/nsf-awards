 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of his project is to understand the molecular                mechanisms underlying the development of the mammalian central                  nervous system.  Many physiological factors influence the                       development of the central nervous system.    Among these factors,              thyroid hormones are known to be absolutely essential for proper                development.   The actions of thyroid hormones are mediated through             nuclear receptors, which regulate the expression of specific target             genes in response to hormone binding.  However, the genes that are              regulated by thyroid hormones in the developing brain are largely               unknown.  The main objective of this proposal is to identify the                targets of thyroid hormone receptor action in the brain during a                time frame that is critical for proper development.  Target genes               will be isolate using subtractive hybridization coupled with                    polymerase chain reaction amplification to identify genes that are              expressed in euthyroid but not hypothyroid animals.  These genes                will then be characterized with respect to their patterns of                    expression and nucleotide sequence.  Using a molecular approach to              focus on a class of genes that are likely to be important for                   central nervous system development will significantly advance our               understanding of the effects of differential gene expression on the             developing nervous system.  The identification and isolation of                 thyroid hormone responsive genes, coupled with characterization of              the proteins they encode, is an essential first step in realizing               the ultimate goals of this proposal.",
