 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ever since November and December of 1942, when survey teams                     identified Los Alamos, New Mexico and Hanford, Washington as new                sites for two key components of the Manhattan Project, the West has             been valued by America's atomic programs for its remoteness, its                supposed emptiness, and its natural resources.  Although western                states had become wary of involvement with the nuclear industry by              the 1980's, for much of the period after 1942 they welcomed their               association with the production of atomic energy and weapons                    because it hastened their growth.  The Federal government spent                 billions of dollars on western laboratories and towns, production               and assembly facilities, and test sites.  It brought more                       scientific and cultural sophistication to a region that had been                regarded as relatively backward in cultural terms, and it gave some             Westerners a greater sense of belonging by seemingly incorporating              them more closely into a national purpose.                                                                                                                      In order to examine the history of the atomic industry in the West,             Drs. Findlay and Hevly are organizing a scholarly meeting, \"The                 Atomic West:  Federal Power and Regional Development\" to be held                25-27 September 1992 in Seattle.  The conference's goal is to bring             historians of science and technology together with historians of                the American West, along with other scholars, in order to stimulate             a consideration of the regional context in studies of the                       Federally-sponsored development of nuclear technology.  This                    conference will help historians of science and technology situate               their work in the social, political and environmental contexts of               the West, and encourage historians of he West to integrate an                   understanding of history of science into regional history.  Public              and educational outreach are also part of this conference.",
