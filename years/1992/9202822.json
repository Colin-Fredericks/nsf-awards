 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Arthur Demarest, Ms Stacey Symonds                   will collect data for her doctoral dissertation.  Building on her               prior work in the region, she will examine a series of Olmec                    sites in the Gulf coast region of Mexico.  She will conduct a                   regional settlement survey over a five month period.  The survey                will include full coverage of three transects that cross-cut four               environmental zones -- rive levees, lowland floodplains, elevated               lands, and coastal routes.   With the data she collects she                     should be able to estimate how Olmec subsistence strategy and                   population density developed over time.  Comparison of site size                and distribution should provide information on the degree of                    hierarchical organization while data which relates to intrasite                 patterning should shed light on changing social organization.                                                                                                   The Olmec have been characterized as \"America's First                           Civilization\" and are best known for their massive stone                        sculptures and ceremonial sites.  However, very little is                       understood about the origins or development of their society.  It               is from this base that Mayan and Aztec civilizations arose and to               understand this entire process it is important to obtain more                   information on this earliest stage.                                                                                                                             This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data of interest to a large group of archaeologists.  It will                   increase our understanding of how complex societies develop and                 will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
