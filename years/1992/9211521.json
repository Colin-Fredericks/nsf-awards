 "awd_abstract_narration": "Successful management of dynamic decision making tasks is                       widely thought to depend on the adequacy of the decision makers'                \"mental models\" of the dynamic environment.  A mental model is                  usually taken to be some representation of the decision maker's                 knowledge and understanding of the dynamic task.  This project                  will explore mental models -- their measurement, their                          correctness, and their relation to performance.                                                                                                                 The central question to be addressed is:  To what degree                        does the ability of humans to perform in dynamic environments                   depend on their understanding of the system to be managed?                      Understanding of the task is indicated by the correspondence                    between the mental model and the system model.                                                                                                                  This question has not been addressed in previous research on                    dynamic decision making because a) the dynamic systems used were                simple and were described in a way that would maximize                          understanding of the systems, and b) system understanding, i.e.,                correspondence between mental models and system models, was not                 assessed.  Therefore, it has not been possible to determine                     whether suboptimal performance was due to lack of understanding                 of the system (an inadequate mental model), lack of an ability to               manage the system even though it is understood (inability to use                the model as an effective guide to action), or both.                                                                                                            This project is the result of collaboration between judgment                    researchers and system dynamicists.  A dynamic policy simulation                model of the JOBS program (a social services program intended to                get people off of welfare and into the workforce) has been                      developed and validated.  A user interface for the model has also               been developed and it has been found to be a feasible basis for                 decision making simulations.  In this project, the JOBS model                   will provide a platform for realistic simulation of dynamic                     decision making in a public policy context.  Subjects will                      include policy experts (county social services commissioners and                staff) and novices (graduate students in public administration).                Three distinct but interrelated types of mental models (\"ends\"                  models, \"means\" models, and models of system functioning) will be               assessed before and after the policy simulation using two                       different methods.  Model coherence and correctness, and the                    relation between performance and quality of each of the three                   types of models will be evaluated.",
