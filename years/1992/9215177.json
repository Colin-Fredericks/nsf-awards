Sheridan at                    the University of Nevada Reno.  Photochemical generation of                     biradicals in matrices and in solution will be examined.  The                   mechanism of decomposition of the azo precursors to                             meta-photoaddition biradicals will be studied in order to                       determine the structural features which dictate stepwise versus                 concerted partitioning on the reaction surface.  Experiments                    designed to determine if hot molecule reactions are important                   in matrices and in solution will be conducted.  Photochemical                   pathways to didehydroaromatic biradicals will also be explored.                 %%%                                                                             The interaction of light with highly energetic molecules                        trapped at low temperature in solid matrices will be examined.                  The low temperature matrix will prolong the lifetime of                         reactive species formed in these photochemical reactions by                     effectively isolating these reactive intermediates from each                    other.  The effect of adding more energy than necessary to form                 these reactive intermediates will be carefully examined.  These                 studies will provide important information on the decomposition                 pathways of highly energetic molecules and intermediates.",
