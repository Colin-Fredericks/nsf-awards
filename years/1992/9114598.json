 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bosart proposes to continue his case study analyses of                     subsynoptic scale midlatitude cyclones and fronts. Specifically,                he proposes to complete a final set of case studies using date                  from the GALE (1986) field experiment, to begin collaborative                   research on the numerical prediction of coastal mesoscale weather               systems, and to participate in the STORM-FEST (1992) field                      experiment and the post-experiment analysis phase. This                         experiment will produce data sets gathered by next-generation                   observational systems (e.g. Profilers and Doppler radars).                      Evaluation and systems testing of their capability to enhance                   operational detection and forecasting of intense mesoscale                      weather events are among the primary experimental objectives. In                addition, there have been defined scientific objectives for a set               of frontal and mesoscale studies of cool-season weather systems                 typical of the central US. Bosart's third line of proposed                      research is focussed on this last set of objectives. He has                     contributed to the scientific planning of the field experiment,                 by conducting background climatological analyses and identifying                specific research opportunities that should result.                                                                                                                  The proposed work is expected to be a major contribution to                STORM-FEST's scientific objectives, based on Bosart's role in                   similar field experiments in the past. It will augment the return               from the significant investment in scientific resources                         represented by the experiment.",
