 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. James Hill, Professor of Anthropology                at UCLA, MS Lisa Lucero will collect data for her doctoral                      dissertation. As part of a larger long term project she will                    conduct archaeological excavation in the upper Belize River area                in Belize. The focus of her work will be the late Maya period                   (ca. 600-900 AD) which represents the highest level of                          integration in the region. She will excavate a series of four                   domestic compounds divided between upland and lowland regions and               high, medium and low status groups. Sites will be cored to locate               activity areas and on this basis large horizontal excavation will               be conducted. The recovered remains - mostly ceramics - will then               be studied to determine their function, the amount of work                      required to produce them, and whether they were made at the site                or imported from elsewhere. With this data it should then be                    possible to compare compounds on the basis of economic and social               organization.                                                                                                                                                   Work in the Mayan area has shown that domestic units formed                     descrete groups and provided the basic building blocks of                       society. While much work has been done on elite groups very                     little is known about their lower class counterparts. Also it is                not understood how these units were integrated to form the larger               functioning society. Was, for example, production specialized by                class and did exchange across class lines strengthen societial                  bonds? By examining a series of compounds which cross both                      geographic and status grounds, MS Lucero will be able to examine                such issues.                                                                                                                                                    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to a large number of archaeologists. It will                   increase our understanding of how one of the great New World                    prehistoric civilizations developed and was maintained and it                   will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
