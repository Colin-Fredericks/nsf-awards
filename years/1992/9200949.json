 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research has two over-arching goals:  (1) to determine                the geohistorical factors that control the distribution of                      Caribbean inshore fishes and (2) to improve the scientific basis                for conservation of fishes, particularly in the Caribbean coastal               zone.  It arises from the discovery that many Caribbean fishes have             distribution s that conform to ancient geotectonic features rather              than to current ecological barriers.  Consequently, it is expected              that analysis of distribution patterns will be informative about                the origin of the Antillean fauna and about processes that were                 fundamental in the formation of the Caribbean Basin.  The project               proposes to survey the poorly known inshore fish faunas of                      selected regions in the Caribbean Basin to delimit areas of                     endemism of both inshore and freshwater fishes on the Caribbean                 Tectonic Plate, and to infer general patterns of area relationships             based on the interrelationships of the fishes.                                       The sampling program that will address the biogeographic                   points above is precisely the same as that needed to develop                    management plans for Caribbean fishes.  In order to maximize the                project's contribution to conservation of fishes, surveys will be               directed at areas where marine biodiversity preserves are under                 development, but where shorefish biodiversity has not yet been                  adequately assessed.  The project will result in taxonomic                      references, keys for identification, and analyses of geographic                 variation that are needed for marine fish management.",
