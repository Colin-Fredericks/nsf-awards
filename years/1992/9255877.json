The purpose is two-fold.  First, to                      significantly increase the level of communication among                         acknowledged experts in the field - concerned teachers,                         educational researchers, curriculum and software developers,                    and practicing mathematicians and scientists.  The second is                    to produce a research and planning agenda that policy makers                    can use to prioritize funding of research and implementation                    projects.                                                                                                                                                       A small group of key participants, representing teachers,                       researchers, developers, and scientists, will form the                          steering committee to guide in the selection of conference                      participants.  The two conferences will be held one year                        apart, with work groups established during the first                            conference to gather data for writing the final guide for                       policy makers.  Immediately after the first conference an                       anthology of papers contributed by invitees will be                             published as a statement of current understandings about                        using modeling and simulations in the precollege                                environment.",
