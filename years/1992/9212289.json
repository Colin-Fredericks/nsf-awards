The equipment will be used                                        for many interdisciplinary research projects                                    at UCSD involving photonics components                                          and system research, including in particular                                    (a) high speed, large bandwidth, large                                          dynamic range waveguide devices, (b)                                            planar, monolithic and array integration of                                     high performance photonic devices, (c) a                                        wideband traveling-wave waveguide                                               photodetector, (d) hybrid optical transmitter                                   at high center frequency, (e) dielectric                                        properties of multiple quantum wells.                                           These projects, based on a synergy                                              between optoelectric material, devices, and                                     system, will lead to higher performance                                         fiber optic communication systems.
