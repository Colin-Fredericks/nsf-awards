 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues research on iterative substructuring methods             and other domain decomposition algorithms for partial differential              equations.  These algorithms are iterative methods for the parallel             solution of very large systems of algebraic equations that arise in             finite element/difference modeling of petroleum reservoirs,                     computational fluid dynamics, elasticity, etc.  In each iteration, the          restriction of the given problem to each of many subregions is solved           approximately and data is exchanged between neighboring subdomains.  A          global problem, with few degrees of freedom per subdomain, is also              required to obtain fast convergence when many subdomains are used.                                                                                              The research will focus on analyzing, improving and implementing                several classes of domain decomposition algorithms, in particular,              those which are suitable for emerging massively parallel systems.  The          ultimate goal is to solve very large, ill-conditioned problems of               continuum mechanics for which traditional iterative methods are                 unsatisfactory and for which direct methods are too slow and require            too much memory.  The underlying theory, which has proven central in            the recent development of these fast algorithms, will be further                developed and the ideas tested in systematic numerical experiments.",
