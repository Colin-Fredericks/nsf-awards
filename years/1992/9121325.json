 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technique of optical laser trapping is, potentially, a powerful             tool for studying fundamental interactions of light with biological             media on a microscopic scale.  The ability to interprete, quantify,             and predict the effects of coherent radiation forces, will be key               to its effective use and development as an analytical tool in                   biomedical and surgical applications.  Herein, we describe the                  development of a single beam, infrared optical trapping system, and             its use, as a micromanipulation tool and a noncontact force                     transducer, in the study of biological media and cellular                       interactions,  The system, consisting of a tunable laser source, a              high resolution microforce transducer, forward scattering detector,             and data acquisition system, is to be used in the (1)                           quantification of trap generated forces and thermal contributions               to the confinement process; and (2) basic study of red blood cell,              chromosome, and organelle micromanipulation behavior in a single                beam optical potential.  Other potential applications for the                   optical trapping system to be developed herein are also described.              An artificially engineered organic liposome model is presented as               a way of determining, in a controlled fashion, the physical and                 optical characteristics of cell and cell membrane samples, and                  their effect on optical trapping performance.  In addition, a light             scattering model, and set of experimental measurements, is to be                used in the correlation of theoretical and experimental results.                This quantitative theory is applied, in one case, to the cell                   biology study of transport mechanisms along microtubules.  A                    working knowledge of the physical parameters that are responsible               for generating and maintaining an optical trap, and their effect on             host biological samples, should be useful to both researchers and               practitioners of optical trapping systems.",
