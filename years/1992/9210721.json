 "awd_abstract_narration": "the research will be concerned with the development of a new and                efficient approach to the simulation of construction processes,                 based on the use of artificial neural networks.  The primary                    objective is to capitalize on the automatic modeling capabilities               and inherent speed of neural networks, so as to make simulation a               more accessible and productive tool for planners.                                                                                                               Alternative schemes for implementing construction simulation in                 neural network environment will be evaluated to determine that with             the greatest efficacy.  This will be measured in terms of the speed             of execution of a simulation, the ease with which valid models can              be built, the accuracy of simulation results.  The comparison will              be made over a comprehensive range of modeling situations.                      consideration will be given to all principal types of neural                    architecture and training procedure that have potential application             to the problem.                                                                                                                                                 The solution is expected to increase simulation speed by several                orders of magnitude relative to conventional simulation methods,                make processing speed independent of the complexity of a model, and             facilitate the task of building valid models.  Many of the concepts             and ideas developed in the research could be extended to simulation             applications outside the field of construction.",
