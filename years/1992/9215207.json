 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this doctoral dissertation improvement                 award is to clarify the physical and cultural capabilities of an                ancestor of humans, Homo erectus.  H. erectus is particularly                   important as it was this species which first moved out of Africa                and colonized much of the Old World, implying improvement in the                ability to deal with environmental challenges. This earlier hominid             is represented at Olduvai Gorge in East Africa, a site which                    contains rich faunal assemblages from the appropriate period of                 about 1.7 to 1.2 million years ago.                                                                                                                             The investigators will undertake a two fold approach to clarifying              the abilities of these hominids.  First, the fauna from Bed II at               Olduvai Gorge will be analyzed in order to determine the processes              which led to their deposition. The types and frequencies of bones,              their sizes, abrasion and modification can assist in determining                the subsistence behavior of H. erectus.  Secondly a series of                   ethnoarchaeological experiments will be carried out to clarify the              behavioral interpretation of hominid bone processing.  Butchery                 marks on bone resulting from observed practices among the Samburu               of Kenya will be compared to the evidence left by our ancestors in              orde r to better understand the ways in which the earlier forms                 processed their food.",
