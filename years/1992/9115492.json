 "awd_abstract_narration": "The anti-correlation between cosmic ray fluxes and the level               of solar activity (solar modulation) is caused by magnetic field                irregularities carried by the solar wind that sweep charged                     particles out of the solar system and/or decelerate them.  Since                electrons and nuclei have greatly different charge/mass ratios,                 the relation of velocity and magnetic rigidity is significantly                 different for these two particle species.  If the heliospheric                  magnetic field has long range order, the charge sign of cosmic                  ray particles can affect their propagation.  A major failure of                 current modulation model simultaneously to reproduce electron and               nucleon modulation is related to reversals of the solar magnetic                field which occur every eleven years.  Charge dependence should                 change when the solar field reverses, but in a way different from               what is observed.  The PIs propose a research program designed to               extend measurements of charge dependence of cosmic ray solar                    modulation through comparison of electron data to be obtained                   under this proposal with electron and proton data available from                an instrument on the ICE spacecraft as well as other data from                  the literature.  This investigation will determine the extent to                which large scale order of the heliospheric magnetic field is                   important in determining trajectories of charged particles in the               heliosphere.",
