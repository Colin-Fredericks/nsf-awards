 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research centers on extensions and refinements of large               deviations theory, especially motivated by applications to                      problems of communication and control, to comparative analysis of               molecular (DNA and protein) sequences, and to studies of queueing               processes and sequential experimentation.  Among the expected                   results are new limit theorems for distributions conditioned on                 rare events of exponentially small probabilities, and the novel                 analysis of the empirical law of segments of Markov processes and               Markov random fields that are selected by means of appropriate                  stopping times.  Another promising new approach is based on using               association inequalities (of the FKG type), and exchangeability                 as tools for obtaining large deviations bounds.  These bounds are               applicable for the estimation of time-varying parameters and for                comparing sampling schemes in terms of rare events probabilities.                    This research centers on estimating the chances for rare                   events to occur, in areas where such events are of fundamental                  importance.  Examples include assessing statistical significance                of unusual DNA sequence segment compositions, analysis of long                  waiting times in complex queueing systems, and analysis of                      parallel computer systems.",
