 "awd_abstract_narration": "Housing is a scarce and valued resource particularly in the                urban agglomerations of less developed countries. This study will               examine access to housing and the quality of neighborhoods in                   which people live in a large Chinese city, Tianjin.  Chinese                    cities have developed over the last forty years within a state                  socialist framework where an egalitarian ideology was promoted,                 and organized systems of housing and service allocation were                    based on public rather than private investments.  The central                   research questions guiding this study is what inequalities in                   housing and urban infrastructure survive in such a system, and                  what are the factors associated with more favorable outcomes,                   that is better housing and better neighborhoods.                                     This study will provide important insights into the bases of               inequality characteristic of a state socialist economic system.                 It also provides a crucial baseline for future studies on the                   impact on the transition to a market economy which is beginning                 in China.",
