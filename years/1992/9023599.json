 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. Christina Romer under the                    National Science Foundation's Faculty Awards for Women Scientists               and Engineers Program.  The objectives of this program are to                   recognize the nation's most outstanding and promising women                     scientists and engineers in academic careers in research and                    teaching, to retain them in academia, and to facilitate the                     further development of their careers.                                                                                                                           This award will allow the investigator to pursue her research                   interests which focuses on the nature and causes of business                    cycles in the period before World War II, in the hopes of                       learning more about how the modern economy operates and about                   what can be done to prevent or mitigate business cycles in the                  future.  Three projects will be undertaken.  The first will                     analyze the role of macroeconomic policy stabilization of real                  output during the Great Depression.  The second will involve                    examining whether monetary and fiscal policies in the post war                  era have tended to in general to counteract or exacerbate                       movements in real output.  The third project will extend the PI's               previous work on historical macroeconomic data.  Her previous                   work has shown that since the conventional series is seriously                  flawed, it is important to look for new and better sources of                   prewar data.",
