 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to observe deformations along 2500 km of one               of the world's most prolific generators of large and great                      earthquakes, the Chilean convergent plate margin.  The proposed                 distribution of regional GPS observing sites is focused on                      measurements of deformation of the region immediately above the                 main interplate seismic zone, but includes stations on the Nazca                plate and sites across the Andes to establish the overall plate                 motions and deformations within the Andean orogen.  This regional               GPS network would be observed every two years during six week                   campaigns with receivers utilized in a pattern of fixed and leap-               frogging mobile deployments.  During the intervening years                      subsidiary campaigns mounted using 5 or 6 receivers would implement             a program of spatial densification at specially selected parts of               the regional network.  Approximately 40-60 sites would abe observed             during each subsidiary campaign.  The primary short-term scientific             objective is to measure seismic and aseismic deformations in the                cycle of major interplate earthquake recurrence in relation to                  plate convergence and the tectonics of the subduction zone.  The                secondary, longer-term objective is to observe the horizontal and               vertical deformations with the forearc and across the Andean                    cordillera.  The proposed consortium includes U.S. experts in GPS               deployment and data analysis; South American seismicity, tectonics              and field operations; and strong ties with Chilean, Argentine and               Bolivian scientists and the national geodetic surveys.",
