 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with concurrent computing on interconnected           collections of computer systems, including multiprocessors, vector              supercomputers, and specialized scalar machines.  Such a network                based, virtual concurrent computing environment is valuable both for            increasing overall resource availability and sharing, and for                   exploiting special capabilities of individual machines.  This project           will investigate critical issues in such a computing system, and                develop solutions that permit the effective and efficient utilization           of network based concurrent processing environments.                                                                                                            Analyses of high-performance applications, existing tools, and our              experiences with a prototype network based system have identified the           key areas that will be focussed upon in this research.  One concerns            appropriate methodologies and tools to assist in mapping portions of            the application to the best suited resources in a heterogeneous                 environments.  Another area of importance concerns improving the                efficiency of communications facilities in networked environments.              Support mechanisms to enable efficient concurrent computing over                different network types, strategies for the implementation high level           concurrency primitives, and lowering the overheads of operating in              heterogeneous environments are issues that will be focused upon.  The           project will have a pragmatic orientation, and an experimental                  approach will be adopted.",
