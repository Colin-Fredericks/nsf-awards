 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of undocumented migration raises some of the most                   pressing political and social issues of contemporary time, both                 within many individual countries and at the international level.                The unauthorized entry, presence, and employment of increasing                  numbers of aliens poses distinct problems of border control and                 deterrence, and unique concerns of human and democratic rights.                 This Research Opportunities for Women Planning Grant will enable                the investigator to plan for a comparative study of the social and              legal status of undocumented immigrants in contemporary France and              Spain.  The study will involve examination of each state's                      immigration regulatory regime, including formal rules and their                 enforcement; rules and practices regarding the treatment of                     undocumented immigrants in matters not directly related to                      immigration regulation; and the interplay between both of these                 sociolegal spheres within each state.  The planning grant will                  enable the investigator to intensively study the European civil law             system, establish research contacts and resources, and further                  develop the research model and design of the project.                                                                                                           The study of undocumented immigrants in receiving countries                     provides a striking model of the complex interplay between legal                status and social relationships in an individual society.  This                 study will be unique in that it will document the relationship                  between the immigrant's status as an object of immigration control              and his/her legal and social status in society in the non-                      immigration regulatory spheres.  The results of the forthcoming                 research project will contribute to knowledge about the competing               drives toward closure and inclusion and toward national community               and universal human rights that often plague democratic nations.                As such the study will facilitate the advancement of general                    hypotheses about the internal functioning of national political and             social systems in an era of significant international population                movements.",
