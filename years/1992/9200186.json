This conference will bring together both                           established and younger scientists and students from around the                 world who are working on the forefront of molecular beam                        research.  In the conference sessions the contribution of                       molecular beams to a broad range of basic and practical                         applications will be emphasized, focussing on areas such as                     collision dynamics, beam-photon and beam-surface interactions,                  atomic and molecular clusters, applications, and molecular beam                 techniques.  Each of the eight sessions will have four to six                   speakers, with the balance of the time being devoted to                         contributed oral presentations.  There will be a ninth, poster                  session.                                                                        %%%                                                                             The main purposes of this symposium are to enhance the                          contribution of molecular beams to a broad range of                             interdisciplinary chemical and physical phenomena as well as                    their practical and other applications; to expose a larger                      fraction of the North American molecular beams community to the                 ideas and thinking of the European community; and to expose                     young North American scientists and students to the latest                      developments in the subject as well as to the world-class                       research scientists attending symposium.",
