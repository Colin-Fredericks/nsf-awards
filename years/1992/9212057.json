 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the impact of changes in the spatial                    distribution of employment opportunities within urban areas on                  minority and youth employment outcomes.  The central focus of the               study is to study the extent to which the mismatch between the                  location and types of jobs and the location and skills of                       potential employees helps explain contemporary black/white                      differences in employment.  The study will use data for census                  tracts in twelve metropolitan areas in the United States.                            This study is an important addition to the literature on the               causes of racial differences in employment rates.  The unique                   contribution of the study is that it develops direct measures of                employment potentials for small areas (tracts).  This in turn                   makes it possible to assess empirically whether the so-called                   spatial mismatch hypothesis is correct.  The spatial mismatch                   hypothesis suggests that the cause of the low employment rates                  for black men in some metropolitan areas in the United States is                that they live in areas where there are no jobs available that                  match the skills they bring to the labor market.",
