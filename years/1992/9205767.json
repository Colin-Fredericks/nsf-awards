 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will utilize Pb and Sr isotope                       systematics to investigate weathering rates and mechanisms in areas             of granitoid bedrock.  Waters, soils and bedrock will be                        investigated from drainages with variable glacial histories in                  arctic, temperate and tropical regions.  Pb and Sr are well suited              for this study because each has highly variable isotope ratios in               granitic minerals, the two elements are concentrated into different             minerals, and they have complementary aquatic behavior.  Pb is                  relatively immobile in the hydrocycle (adsorbed by O-donor surface              groups), whereas Sr is mobile in the hydrocycle (remains in                     solution).  Pb and Sr isotopes studied in conjunction with other                trace metals, major cations and anions can be used to look through              secondary geochemical and biochemical processes and directly                    determine the relative rates of weathering of the various bedrock               minerals.  This study will have applications to estimations of                  modern weathering rates and mechanism in areas of variable climate              and glacial history.  We will also investigate the effects of                   global climate change of weathering by studying the fluvial and                 lacustrine record of changes in the isotopic composition of Pb (in              Fe-Mn oxide coatings on sediment particles) and Sr (in calcareous               shells) released by weathering back through the stratigraphic                   record of glacial and interglacial cycles.",
