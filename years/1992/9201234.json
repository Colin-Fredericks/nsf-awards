The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit              by Dr. John M. Zielinski of Pennsylvania State University to work               with Professor Doctor Hans Sillescu at the Institut fur                         Physikalische Chemie der Universitat Mainz.                                                                                                                     Knowledge of the diffusion rate is essential in designing adequate              products for numerous applications including: (1) devolatilization,             (2) medicinal time-controlled release, (3) drying of paints and                 coatings, (4) packaging or barrier membranes and (5) separation                 processes.  Despite the importance of polymer/solvent diffusion                 coefficients, however, proportionately little data of this type are             available in the literature, particularly at varying solvent                    concentrations.  Due to the escalating emphasis on reducing                     emissions from commercial processes, diffusion studies of                       penetrant molecules in polymer systems at this time are warranted               if not essential.                                                                                                                                               Mutual-diffusion processes are inherently coupled to polymer and                solvent self-diffusion and their thermodynamic interaction.  The                Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) nuclear magnetic resonance                     (NMR) technique and holographic grating have previously been                    employed to measure solvent self-diffusion coefficients.  Only                  recently, however, have advances in instrumentation rendered these              techniques viable for addressing polymer self-diffusion as well.                                                                                                Although acquiring data directly is extremely important,                        complementary theoretical studies are also required so that                     diffusional characteristics for polymer/solvent systems can be                  predicted a priori.  The coupling of the self-and mutual coefficients           is the weakest link in existing diffusion theories.  Consequently, an           indepth experimental and theoretical study of the relationship                  between the individual self-diffusion coefficients and the                      polymer/solvent mutual-diffusion coefficient is proposed.                                                                                                       This award recommendation provides funds for a stipend for twelve               months.",
