Curriculum.                                                                                                                                                2.

Alignment of curricular goals with assessment.                                                                                                             The vehicles for change will include Beacon Schools, schools                    selected to be laboratories for testing new curriculum                          materials and teaching methods and, later, as models and                        dissemination centers for all schools in Maine.  Fourteen                       mathematics and science facilitators will be responsible for                    dissemination of instructional materials, methods, and                          technology developed at the Beacon Schools.  At the                             postsecondary level, Maine will establish a Beacon College,                     a consortium of institutions of higher education that will                      reform their teacher preparation programs consistent with                       the Beacon Schools' needs.  In addition, the State will                         mount community awareness programs, progressive institutes                      and workshops for teachers, and efforts to increase the use                     of technology.  Mathematicians and scientists will                              participate throughout the project's components.",
