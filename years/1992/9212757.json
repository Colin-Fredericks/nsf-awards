 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pelagic biogeography has been limited by the inability to                       distinguish genetic structure of a species.  The problems include               constant movement of local populations, unknown oceanic circulation             patterns, the 3-dimensional aspect of the ocean and the                         difficulties inherent with oceanic sampling.  This project will                 examine members of the Phylum Ctenophora using modern molecular                 techniques to help elucidate the taxonomy of this understudied                  group of organisms.  Ctenophores are abundant in all the oceans and             occur at all depths in the water column.  Distribution of                       ctenophores is often patchy and these patches can fluctuate in time             and location.                                                                                                                                                   The techniques developed by molecular biologists (e.g.  allozymes               and nucleic acid analyses) are appropriate for the marine sciences              and represent novel tools for the marine scientist to examine the               distribution of marine populations.  These techniques have been                 utilized for fisheries but have not been applied to gelatinous                  zooplankton despite the importance and abundance of this group.                                                                                                 There are a number of ctenophore species that occur in the Monterey             Bay area, the majority of which are still undescribed. This project             will consist of:: 1.  Collection of specimens and the isolation of              genomic DNA focused on Monterey Bay with shallow-water and deep-                water collections; 2. Use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction to                   amplify the nuclear encoded small ribosomal subunit genes (ssRNA),              spacer regions, and certain DNA segments of the mitochondrial                   genome;  3.  Analyze the amplified DNA with restriction enzymes in              order to detect any Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms that              are present: 4. Sequencing of the amplified DNA either directly                 from the PCR product or after cloning the product; 5. Analysis of               the sequences will be done using DOTPLOT, BESTFIT, and                          GAP/RANDOMIZATION; 6. Clarification of the taxonomy of the Phylum               Ctenophora using a combination of the molecular data and classical              data (morphology and natural history).  The use of the ssRNA                    sequences will be most useful for the higher taxonomic levels while             the sequence information from the spacer region or mtDNA regions                will be useful for examining the variation within species.",
