 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the course of developing the world's most efficient                     manufacturing sector, U.S. management has relied increasingly on                beliefs and practices which are proving to be less well adapted to              post-1980 requirements for regaining international competitiveness.             The objective of this research is to undertake an intensive                     exploration of the management development policies, practices and               results in five major Japanese companies as the basis for                       comparison with five major U.S. firms in similar industries.                         Field work for the Japanese portion of this exploratory                    project has been completed.  This project will carry out the U.S.               complementary part of this undertaking.  Given the urgent need for              better understanding of the core issues underlying our county's                 decline in manufacturing competitiveness, this study is not only                timely but should contribute a unique and very well respected                   perspective to the knowledge base in technology management.",
