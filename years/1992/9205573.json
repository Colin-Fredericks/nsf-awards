 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between chromatin organization, nuclear                   architecture and gene expression in all eukaryotes and,                         specifically, in terrestrial plants is a complex and unresolved                 question.  Chromosomal domains, consisting of chromatin loops                   attached to the chromosomal scaffold, may provide a specialized                 environment for gene expression.  Supporting this hypothesis,                   transgenes inserted at different loci in a plant genome very in                 expression levels.  Scaffold Attachment Regions (SAR) are DNA                   elements that bind to the nuclear scaffolds and could anchor loop               domains.  We have discovered that the HSC80 gene of tomato is                   flanked by SAR regions, suggesting that, in vivo, the association               of these SAR elements with the scaffold.  The putative loop domain              will be compared to a DNAase I-hypersensitivity map of the same                 region.  Using transgenic plants, we will determine whether                     flanking SARs are necessary for position-independent, copy-number-              dependent expression of a HSC80-Gus chimeric gene and of a                      mannopine synthase (Mas)-Gus chimeric gene.  To avoid a selection               bias, we will characterize the expression pattern of Mas-Gus                    transgenes that were not directly selected.  We will obtain                     unselected insertion of the chimeric Gus gene by co-transformation              with a separate T-DNA carrying the kanamycin resistance gene.                   %%%                                                                             It has been clear for some time that the programmed regulation of               gene expression during development and in different tissues is too              complex to be totally explained by cis and trans acting factors.                One idea which has become more and more acceptable is that                      chromosome structure somehow plays a part in such precise control               of gene expression and the information which should result from the             successful completion of this work will give greater insight into               possible mechanisms of regulation.",
