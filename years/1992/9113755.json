 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the way that the legal and institutional                structure of government in Japan shapes policymaking and                        enforcement.  The analytic approach is guided by a rational-choice              principal-agent perspective.  Undertaking both theoretical and                  empirical work, the research challenges \"culturalist\" theories                  holding that Japanese bureaucracy, and more specifically Japanese               bureaucratic culture, has a singular and salient effect on Japanese             policy-making.  A working hypothesis in the study is that \"culture\"             is a less effective explanatory variable than particular rational               concerns explored under the rubric of \"principal-agent\" theory.                 Based on time-series analyses over four decades, the study examines             the impact that changes in international trade and domestic                     elections have had on budget patterns, regulatory policies, court               decisions, and bureaucratic and judicial career paths.                                                                                                          By clarifying the institutional structure of politics and testing               the impact that this structure has on Japanese domestic and                     international policies, the study will identify the determinants                of Japanese policymaking and enforcement and how those change under             foreign pressure.  It will also move principal-agent theory beyond              its U.S.-based roots to a more global model.  As such, it will                  uncover new ways of understanding the role of party leaders, new                forms of principal-agent monitoring, and new implications that such             monitoring poses for judicial independence.",
