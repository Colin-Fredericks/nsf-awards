 "awd_abstract_narration": "When examined over long periods of time, counts of the number              of organizations in diverse populations initially grow slowly, then             grow rapidly for a short time, peak, then decline and stabilize                 (and often eventually decline).  This project continues a line of               research that seeks to explain this pattern by means of developing              a set of mathematical models based on a sociological theory of                  density-dependent evolution, that is, the pattern of the birth,                 growth, decline, and mortality of organizations as a function of                the number of organizations in a population.  Among the new issues              that are being confronted by this project are the disentanglement               of the effects of age versus size of organizations and of density               versus mass of populations and the application of density theory                to the community level as well as to individual populations.  Data              will be collected on populations and communities of financial                   institutions and newspaper publishing firms to examine these issues             empirically.                                                                                                                                                         This project will not only contribute to our understanding of              the forces shaping organizational structures over long time spans,              but also it will contribute to the provision of a theoretical                   structure for explaining how organizational change produces changes             in society.",
