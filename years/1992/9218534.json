 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER will support the urgent salvage of approximately                3000 rare and valuable bird carcasses recovered from the Exxon                  Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska.  The birds, stored            in four enormous freezer vans, have been held as evidence in legal              proceedings by the U.S. District Court for Alaska since 1989, but               are now scheduled to be destroyed on or before September 30, 1992.              Two basic reasons to salvage the Valdez birds are: (1) to complement            the world's holdings of rare specimens; and (2) to provide rare                 material for important research on avian biology.  The Valdez                   seabirds represent a Spring sampling, whereas most seabird holdings             in museums are Summer/Fall.  Further, 11 species of seabirds in the             Valdez collection are represented by fewer than 100 skeletons in the            world's collections, and four of the species are listed as either               endangered or threatened.  Other species that the PI will salvage               can no longer be collected in large numbers to study morphological              variation.  Research projects made possible by the salvage                      collection include the study and recognition of new species                     (Red-faced and Pelagic Cormorants), the ecology of seabird molt, the            origin (which breeding colony) of winter and early spring seabirds              along the western coast, and growth patterns in seabirds.  These                specific studies will be cross-disciplinary, involving ecology,                 molecular and morphological systematics, population biology, and                physiological ecology, and will enable a better understanding of                avian systematics, breeding ecology and conservation biology.",
