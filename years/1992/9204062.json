 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator will organize U.S. participation in a                joint U.S.-French workshop on underwater robotics. The workshop                 will be held May 17 to 19, 1992, in Toulon, France.  The French                 co-organizers have agreed to host the meeting at the Toulon                     laboratory of IFREMER, the French Agency responsible for ocean                  related research activities.  Fifteen U.S. participants, selected               to represent a wide range of underwater technology experience and               research interests, will discuss and report on potential areas                  for joint U.S.-French collaborative research.  The goal will be                 to identify research areas which are important to underwater                    robots; interesting as research topics; and in which the French                 and U.S. interests match sufficiently that the workshop                         participants believe substantial collaboration would be possible                and beneficial.  This report will be published in order to form                 the catalyst for U.S. researchers to propose and initiate joint                 projects with the French counterparts.",
