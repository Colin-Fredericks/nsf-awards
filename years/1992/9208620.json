 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dramatic increases in the capacity of computers to                         store and process information has resulted in a                                 reorientation of microeconomic analyses.  Computer-                             intensive methods increasingly have been used to explore                        larger and more complex databases and to sharpen the                            inferences based on those analyses.  Innovation has been                        especially significant with respect to the improvement of                       semiparametric and nonparametric estimation procedures.  To                     address this problem, a group of leading economists, all of                     whom are experienced and productive scientists in their own                     rights, have developed a network to collectively address                        remaining problems in the development of estimation and                         other computational networks.  Those investigators have                         begun development of an integrated network of computer                          workstations.  Through this network, they will exchange                         data and programs in order to further stimulate development                     and testing of new methods.  This award provides funds to                       enable an investigator at the University of Michigan to                         acquire a workstation and link it into this network.  The                       workstation will be used by the investigator and his                            faculty colleagues and graduate students to improve                             computational approaches and to test those approaches                           through analyses of microeconomic data related to a broad                       range of issues.                                                                     This award will enable a group of researchers led by a                     nationally recognized leader in advancements of                                 computational methods for microeconomic analysis to                             accelerate the pace and expand the scope of their                               inquiries.  These researchers will make valuable advances                       of both general and more focused benefit regarding                              computational methodologies, and through their involvement                      in a network of other leading economists, they will                             stimulate research in other settings.",
