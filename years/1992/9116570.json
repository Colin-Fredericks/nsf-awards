 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research has three principal focal areas connected with the                theme of dynamic stress application and high rate chemical                      reactions, as follows: (1) shock-induced chemical reactions (with               controlled recovery experiments, mechanistic modeling, and time-                resolved reaction-rate measurements) and synthesis of novel and                 metastable materials; (2) dynamic compaction of powders to form                 metal-, intermetallic-, and ceramic-matrix composites; controlled               shock-induced and post-shock thermally-induced reactions to tailor              and optimize matrix-reinforcement interface characteristics; (3)                combustion processing by self-propagating chemical reactions in                 powder mixtures, followed by high energy rate densification and                 reaction sintering.  The research is performed at New Mexico Tech.              (shock-induced chemical reactions and synthesis), Los Alamos                    (modeling), Sandia (shock-wave facilities, modeling), Cal. Inst. of             Tech. (shock-tailoring of interfacial reactions in composites), and             UC-San Diego (combustion synthesis, dynamic densification and post-             shock processing) .                                                             %%%                                                                             This is an excellent area of research, where the research has                   potentially high pay-off with the capability to produce new                     materials.  Modeling of the process variables is needed to permit               the scaling up of the process to larger sizes and more complex                  shapes.",
