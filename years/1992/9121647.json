 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research stems from an ecological approach to the study of                 basic learning mechanisms, an approach based on the assumption                  that learning evolved and can be profitably studied within a                    functioning system of behavior.  Specifically, the present                      experiments are designed to reveal the nature and number of the                 mechanisms involved in spatial learning.  Do spatial learning and               search vary with the type of cue used and the effects of reward?                To what extent are there differences between the sensory-motor                  mechanisms controlling efficient search when rewards are used                   versus no rewards or different types of reward?  The answers will               determine the importance of considering the specific system                     context in analyzing spatial learning.                                                                                                                          The more general importance of this work involves establishing                  examples of the extent to which learning can be profitably                      studied within functioning systems of behavior (such as foraging                for food, or seeking safety) rather than based only on very                     general mechanisms.  If systems of behavior are important, it                   suggests that learning can be more effectively produced and                     controlled by understanding the function it serves rather than                  exhaustively analyzing the circumstances that produce it.  In                   humans, the general importance of learning in determining                       behavior is large and unquestioned.  What has not been so                       specifically dealt with is the extent to which learning follows                 somewhat different rules and determinants related to specific                   functions.  Even in humans, learning about spatial locations and                learning appropriate social behaviors may depend on different                   stimuli, motivational states, and mechanisms.  The optimum                      conditions for promoting one sort of learning may well be                       different from the conditions promoting the other.",
