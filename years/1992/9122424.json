 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study imprisonment, placement in                     asylums, and welfare policies in five common-law countries--the                 U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand--                  over the period 1955-1985.  During this period the trend has been               in all five countries toward an increased use of prisons and a                  curtailed use of mental hospitals.  The primary objective of the                study is to study more fully the relationship between changes in                prison and mental hospital populations in the five countries, and               to examine how they relate to changes in welfare policies.                           The study will collect quantitative data on institutional                  capacities, welfare benefits, and other variables in each of the                five countries.  The analysis would use pooled cross-sectional                  timeseries analysis combined with more qualitative historical                   analyses.                                                                            This study will contribute greatly to our understanding of                 how societies identify and sanctions deviants.  Its unique                      contribution will be to link social control practices as                        exemplified by prisons and mental hospitals with wider social and               political processes expressed in the welfare policies of each                   nation.",
