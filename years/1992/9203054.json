 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is currently little or no guidance in the tolerancing                standards for evaluating geometric variation of part feature using              coordinate measuring machines (CMMs).  Practitioners are faced with             many important but unanswered questions, including the number of                measurements that should be made on a part feature, and the                     location of such measurements.  Since the standard requires                     knowledge of the entire feature while a CMM can take only a small               sample in a reasonable time period, there are no simple answers to              these questions.  The objective of this research is to develop a                rigorous procedure for the verification of standard geometric                   tolerance specifications, developing tradeoffs between accuracy and             cost.  The research will involve the following tasks:  a detailed               study of parts to allow identification of common profile variation              patterns for specific processes; the development and evaluation of              estimation techniques for the measurement of geometric variation;               and the study of the relationship between the number of                         measurements and the resulting sampling risks.                                       The impact of the research will be in several areas, including             the development of a procedure to determine an appropriate number               and location of measurements to satisfy specified risk levels.                  Prior information will be exploited regarding feature                           characteristics to reduce sample sizes while maintaining the same               estimation accuracy.  Educational impact will also be included in               the form of classroom instruction, research students, seminars, and             conferences.",
