 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first objective is to solve the crystal structure of red                    abalone sperm lysin using multiple isomorphous replacement.  The                structure will then be refined at 1.9A resolution.  This                        structure will serve as a basis for homology modeling the                       structure of seven other abalone sperm lysins for which Dr. V.D.                Vacquier has the primary sequences.  The superposition of                       sequence and structural information will allow an understanding                 of how the hypervariable regions of the molecule define species                 specificity while the highly conserved regions confer common                    function to all lysins, which is dissolution of the vitelline                   envelope surrounding the egg.  At the same time, the modeling                   analysis will be used to design site-directed mutants, which can                be assayed for biological activity by V.D. Vacquier, to test the                structural hypothesis.  Crystallization experiments with the                    lysins from the other species, and the mutant lysins, will be                   carried out, in order to obtain additional crystal structures to                support or correct the structures observed by homology modeling.                %%%                                                                             The significance of this project pertains to the molecular events               which take place during fertilization.  The molecule being                      studied, sperm lysin, is responsible for dissolving a hole in the               membrane surrounding the egg so that the sperm can penetrate this               membrane.  The species being studied, abalone, offers                           experimental advantages in isolating the protein components for                 both the sperm and egg.  By solving the three-dimensional                       structure of lysin, we can infer how the protein functions.  No                 structure of a protein involved in fertilization has ever been                  solved.  V. D. Vacquier, who provides samples of lysin, has                     primary sequences for lysins from seven abalone species.  The                   sequences show regions of extreme variability and contrasting                   regions of absolute conservation.  Once we know the structure of                one lysin we can map the sequence data onto the structure.  The                 variable regions are important for correct species discrimination               by abalone sperm and egg cells.  The conserved regions are                      important for function, which is membrane insertion and binding.                Both processes, species recognition and membrane insertion, are                 phenomena of general biological significance.",
