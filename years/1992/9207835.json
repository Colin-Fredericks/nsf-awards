 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, Patrick Vacarro of Yale University                   will exploit a newly developed high-resolution laser                            spectroscopic method to explore the ground state potential                      energy hypersurfaces for a number of polyatomic systems,                        including both stable and unstable species.  This degenerate                    four-wave mixing (DFWM) technique relies on the simultaneous                    creation and detection of transient spatial gratings within a                   gas-phase ensemble of molecules and offers several advantages                   over traditional spectroscopies.  The current project will                      furnish information on the structure and dynamics of molecules                  with very highly excited vibration-rotation levels which can                    lead to an enhanced understanding of the intra- and                             intermolecular processes involved with highly excited                           polyatomic species, such as predissociation and ground-state                    isomerism.                                                                      %%%                                                                             Polyatomic molecules which contain large amounts of energy in                   vibrating bonds have an important impact on a wide variety of                   phenomena, such as combustion diagnosis and atmospheric                         modelling.  This study proposes to user laser-based techniques                  to study small transient polyatomic molecules possessing                        considerable vibrational excitation to determine their behavior                 as a result of the excess energy.",
