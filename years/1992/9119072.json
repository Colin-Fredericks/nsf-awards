 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                       research project between Professor John Wingfield, Department of                Zoology, University of Washington, and Professor Masaru Wada,                   Department of General Education, Tokyo Medical and Dental                       University.  Dr. Wingfield studies the role of environmental factors            in controlling the breeding cycle in birds.  His present research               involves assaying reproductive hormones in different species on                 birds under different environmental conditions.  His project with               Professor Wada involves collaboration to develop and apply cDNA                 probes for the reproductive hormones in chicken, since these                    probes will hybridize with the pituitary DNA of these birds.                                                                                                    Avian reproductive cycles are diverse, spanning continuums from                 brief to essentially continuous breeding seasons, and from precisely            timed to opportunistic reproductive periods.  This collaborative                effort will measure changes in gene expression for reproductive                 hormones in response to environmental signals.  This will extend                Dr. Wingfield's current research to test a constancy/contingency                model of predictability as a potential unifying hypothesis to explain           how birds, and perhaps other organisms, integrate environmental                 maturation under varying environmental conditions.",
