 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve the current technology of           semantically-driven global program restructuring, enabling its                  practical application in reducing software maintenance costs.                        Software maintenance is disproportionately costly, and it has              been observed that structural degradation is the primary, but                   unavoidable, cause.  The only alternatives are to reimplement the               system or to restructure it.  Restructuring is the more attractive              approach, though it is a complex activity requiring tool assistance to          manage consistency of changes dispersed through the program text.               Recently, methods have been developed for tool-assisted                         restructuring, and a prototype has been built and tested.  However,             the current methods do not fully address module-level restructuring             or performance issues of interactively manipulating semantic                    information.                                                                         To make these techniques practical, this project endeavors to              design and implement global module transformations, increase the speed          of the tool by incrementally updating data structures, and enhance the          restructuring tool with structural analysis tools and a visual front-           end to support higher-level transformations.  The results are expected          to be natural adaptations of existing results in restructuring,                 compilers, programming environments, and program understanding.                      The result of the research will be a tool employing these                  techniques, allowing high-level interactive restructuring of programs,          and showing that structure is not an inherent barrier to software               maintenance.",
