 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rates of larval settlement may be a major determinant of                        subsequent year-class size for many benthic invertebrates.  Often               it is difficult, however, to elucidate the relative importance of               pre- and post-settlement processes to spatial and temporal                      variability in recruitment.  The American lobster, Homarus                      americanus, recruits from a pelagic postlarva to shelter-                       providing benthic substrata, but little is understood about the                 regulating factors or the consequences of this process.  We plan                to study the linkage from late pelagic to early benthic phase                   along the central coast of Maine, where shallow subtidal cobble                 provides prime recruitment habitat.  Our collaborative studies                  from 1989-1991 suggest that lobster recruitment at some sites may               be limited by larval supply, whereas others may be limited by the               availability of suitable habitat.  We intend to use an                          experimental approach at two sites that consistently represent                  the extremes in recruitment density despite apparent                            similarities of their habitat.  At these sites we will use                      habitat manipulations and postlarval seeding experiments to test                the influence of postlarval supply, habitat quality, and density-               dependent processes on benthic recruitment.  Hydrographic data                  will be collected to examine possible differences in                            stratification as well as absolute temperature structure that may               influence postlarval diving behavior.",
