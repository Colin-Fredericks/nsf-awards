 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                   anthropologist studying the enculturation of children as                        consumers in an eastern city (New Haven).  Ten-year old children                from a middle class and a poor neighborhood will be studied                     through focus groups, observations of individual play sessions,                 structured interviews with children and parents, and participant                observation.                                                                                                                                                    This study's contribution to the understanding of consumption                   will be in documenting the process of children's enculturation as               consumers, by studying children as active participants in the                   process of learning consumer-related skills.  As a study of one                 case in the world's largest consumer society, this project will                 help us understand the ways people become consumption-oriented,                 which can help us design programs and policies to moderate the                  excesses of consumption.",
