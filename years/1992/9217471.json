 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between structure, reactivity, and energetics                  of gas phase organic ion-molecule reactions will be                             investigated. A variable temperature flowing afterglow                          apparatus, along with ab initio molecular orbital calculations,                 will be used to carry out these studies. The resulting                          information will provide mechanistic insights which are                         unavailable from condensed phase work. Species to be                            investigated include vinyl, cyclopropyl, and alkyl anions. As                   well, unimolecular rearrangements and substituent effects will                  be studied. These investigations will provide critical                          information on a number of important areas including hydrogen                   bonding, nucleophilic substitution, eliminations, orbital                       symmetry controlled reactions, and the relationship between                     structure, reactivity, and energetics.                                          %%%                                                                             Many important reactions occur are in the gas phase, including                  most of the reactions involved in atmospheric chemistry. This                   project will therefore not only contribute to an understanding                  of the fundamental principles which control a variety of                        chemical transformations, but will also provide a paridigm for                  understanding processes which occur in the atmosphere. In this                  grant from the Organic Dynamics Program to Professor S. Kass at                 the University of Minnesota, particular attention will be paid                  to investigation of reactions and rearrangements in the gas                     phase which involve negatively charged organic species called                   anions.",
