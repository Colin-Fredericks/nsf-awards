The                            project aims to evaluate hypotheses of major                                    accretionary events in the Colombian Andes Mountains.                                                                                                           The researchers will collect paleomagnetic evidence                             from three major suspect terranes; make structural                              measurements on sense of shear on intervening suture                            zones; and integrate the results into computer models                           of tectonic trajectories and plate motions.  Field                              emphasis will be on three main geographic regions of                            suspect terranes in the Colombian Andes.  The                                   investigators will identify latitudes of origin of                              these terranes.  Outcrops in a mapped region will                               receive primary focus.  Sense of shear and sequential                           changes will be sought along several fault zones.  A                            major goal will be to verify ages of these zones'                               initial appearance.  These new data will permit new                             computer-generated maps of collision events in                                  relation to plate motions.  With this award, the                                Colombian collaborator will acquire training in modern                          techniques of paleomagnetic field-oriented research,                            which will help train the next generation of Colombian                          geologists.  The U.S. side will gain from the                                   opportunity to obtain new insights into plate                                   processes.",
