 "awd_abstract_narration": "A test data collection facility at the Microelectronic                          Engineering Department of the Rochester Institute of Technology                 allows their semiconductor process engineering students to                      evaluate the quality of their designs and processing, manage                    yield improvements, and thoroughly analyze devices and                          processes from a statistical point of view.  The students, who                  fabricate thousands of devices and circuits in their                            undergraduate years, have now a semi-automatic wafer level                      probing capability to collect, analyze, and correlate orders of                 magnitude more test data in the same amount of test time                        previously devoted to manual test procedures.  Tedious re-                      connections to various test instruments for test changeovers                    are being replaced by a flexible matrix switching system.  The                  quality of the design and fabrication processes can be                          determined only if appropriate metrics are obtained.  The                       results of automatic testing for defects in density structures,                 devices, and circuits are considered in this laboratory and                     throughout the microelectronics curriculum.",
