 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has recently become possible to solve quantum reactive                     scattering problems within their full three-dimensional context                 for three-atom systems with modest numbers of energetically-open                initial-and-final quantum states.  While a high level of accuracy               has been achieved for a few simple systems, there remain major                  impediments to the extension of these methods to the vast                       majority of interesting chemical reactions.  The basic                          theoretical and computational issues are easily characterized on                a qualitative level.  First, the complexity and computational                   intensity of current methods even for simple three-atom systems                 challenge current generations of high-performance computers.                    Second, as one moves beyond these simple chemical reactions, the                complexity of the calculations increases tremendously because the               number of open initial-and-final quantum states increases by                    orders of magnitude.  For this reason such problems are currently               beyond the realm of consideration for even the most optimistic of               researchers.  This research will focus on developments that will                provide steps towards solving such problems on massively parallel               computers.",
