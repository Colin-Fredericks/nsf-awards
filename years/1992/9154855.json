 "awd_abstract_narration": "Consumer Reports Television will produce a series of four half-                 hour TV specials and companion outreach materials, called \"YOU                  TEST IT|,\" for public television broadcast and broad educational                and home video distribution.  Targeted for children ages 7 to 13                -- particularly those from low-income, minority families -- the                 project will draw on the resources of Consumers Union, the non-                 profit, scientific, research and education organization that                    publishes Consumer Reports magazine and ZILLIONS, the Consumer                  Reports for Kids.                                                                                                                                               The \"YOU TEST IT| series, created by an experienced team of                     children's TV producers, focuses on testing and evaluating                      popular products -- from observing the bubble-power of bubble                   gum to measuring the efficiency of 10-speed bicycles.  Using                    lively, state-of-the-art techniques appealing to kids, \"YOU TEST                IT|\" will encourage children to use science and math skills to                  investigate and, ultimately, solve real-world problems.  Each of                the 4 programs will cover a broad product theme such as                         Foods/Snacks, Toys/Games, Sports/Recreation, and Electronic                     Gear.  Activity Guides, expanding on these topics, will delve                   more deeply into the science content of each show, providing                    hands-on learning materials for children.                                                                                                                       With repeated broadcasts of \"YOU TEST IT|\" over hundreds of PBS                 stations, and reuse of tape and print materials, millions of                    children will gain greater access to objective product                          information and greater awareness of science and its importance                 in everyday life.",
