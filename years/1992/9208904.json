 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of globally synchronous systems must account for clock               skew due to propagation delays through a distribution network.  In              large or fast systems, electrical path delays must be individually              equalized, a tedious and error-prone process.  Alternatively,                   systems can be designed in an asynchronous or clockless form, but               asynchronous design is not currently or widely understood or                    practiced.  Therefore, improved technology for distribution of                  clock signals continues to be important for high-performance                    systems.                                                                                                                                                        Sinusoidal clock signals in the form of standing waves on the                   clock-distribution conductors can substantially eliminate clock                 skew across a system.  This has been operationally demonstrated in              a branching tree of transmission lines in the Pixel-Planes 5                    system, where a 160 MHz clock is distributed across a three-rack                system with less than 200 ps skew.                                                                                                                              The work in this project will allow generalization to surfaces,                 suggesting the design of synchronous PC boards using clock planes               for low-complexity and low-skew clock distribution.  A series of                experiments and circuit developments are being performed to reduce              the clock-plane concept to engineering practice.  The expected                  results of this research effort consist of a design methodology                 that is both simple and reliable, supported by a library of basic               circuits and CAD tools.",
