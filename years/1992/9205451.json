 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is on the Golgi apparatus, which is the               subcellular site of the biosynthesis, modification, and sorting of              glycoproteins and complex polysaccharides of the plant cell                     surface.  Very little is known about the molecular composition of               the Golgi in plants.  Few of the enzymes involved in the synthesis              of cell wall matrix polysaccharides have been identified and                    characterized.  Nothing is known about the organization of these                enzymes within the Golgi, or how such organization is maintained,               or how polysaccharide synthesis is initiated, or how complex                    polysaccharides are assembled and targeted to specific locations in             the cell wall.  Part of the difficulty has been an inability to                 subfractionate plant Golgi into cis-, medial, and trans-cisternal               elements.  A novel approach is proposed to achieve such separation,             in which a chimaeric protein (translational fusion between the E1               glycoprotein of avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus, IBV-E1, and GUS)             will be used to target the manipulable GUS marker to the Golgi.                 This idea is based on observations in animal systems that IBV-E1 is             targeted to and accumulates in the membranes of the cis-Golgi                   cisternae.  In this project, the ultrastructural location of                    chimaeric markers containing all or part of the IBV-E1 coding                   sequence will be determined by EM colloidal gold immunolocalization             (to be done in collaboration with experts in this technique).                   These studies will establish the feasibility of more extensive                  biochemical work exploiting the IBV-E1 fusion expressed in plant                cells.                                                                          %%%                                                                             A large fraction of the dry weight of plants is in the cell walls.              Plant cell walls are critical to the survival of the plants, since              they provide the rigidity needed to maintain morphology and turgor              pressure. There are indications that cell walls are also critical               components of defense mechanisms against plant pathogens.  They are             the biological sources of significant commercial products, such as              cellulose and cellulose-based products, wood products, and dietary              fiber.  This novel approach to understanding the cell biology of                plant wall biosynthesis may open up the possibility of genetic                  engineering of plant walls for specific purposes.  In addition, the             research should provide important information about the parameters              that affect expression of animal glycoproteins within genetically               engineered plants.  This should be relevant for applications                    involving the recovery of commercially useful animal glycoproteins              from transgenic plants.",
