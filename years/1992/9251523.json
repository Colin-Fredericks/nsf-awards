Undergraduate students at the University of                   Connecticut participate in the simulation by communicating                      through a central computer located at the University of                         Maryland via electronic mail and a real-time teleconferencing                   network.The International Communication and Negotiation                         Simulation offers students the opportunity to learn the                         principles of international negotiations: how to bargain, when                  to compromise, what are the risks and who will benefit.  To be                  effective, the students must learn the importance of teamwork                   and specialization.  Political scientists at the University of                  Connecticut will also use the microcomputer-simulation facility                 to assist in the introduction of more international studies                     into the state high school social studies program. The initial                  phase of the project will involve high school students working                  on simulation exercises in collaboration with undergraduates at                 the University of Connecticut",
