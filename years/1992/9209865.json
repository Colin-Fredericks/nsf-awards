 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since its founding in 1920, one of the National Bureau of Economic              Research's (NBER's) most important goals has been the accurate                  measurement of the aggregate economy.  Especially during its early              years, the NBER devoted considerable resources to the collection                of data, culling this information from both government and private              sources.  These data collection efforts proved extremely valuable               to future researchers in both academia and government.  For                     example, they led directly to the development of the index of                   leading economic indicators.  At the time the data were collected,              there was no method available for storing them electronically, so               the NBER researchers copied them by hand from the original sources              onto data sheets.  In 1978, the Inter-University Consortium for                 Political and Social Research (ICPSR) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with              funding from the NSF, transferred the data from the NBER's                      handwritten sheets to magnetic tape.  This tape is available to the             public from the ICPSR.  A number of researchers have used the ICPSR             tape.  The contribution of this project comes from converting the               ICPSR tape to floppy disks and verifying the accuracy of the data               using the NBER's original handwritten sheets.                                                                                                                   Access to the data will be greatly improved by making it available              on floppy disks in a format compatible with common time series                  packages for the PC.  At present the use of data on the ICPSR tape              requires the cumbersome task of reading the tape on a mainframe and             then downloading the data to a PC.  Since there are over 7,500                  series on the tape, it is time consuming to download them all.                  Additionally, the structure of the tape makes it difficult toe                  extract a single series or a small group of series.  Also the                   process of transferring the data from the NBER's handwritten sheets             to the ICPSR tape introduced a number of mistakes into the data                 set, and this project will correct these mistakes.",
