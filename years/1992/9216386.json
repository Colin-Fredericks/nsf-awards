 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary research in the fields of control                             systems, structural dynamics, and materials science                             is proposed for damage mitigation and failure                                   prognosis of mechanical structures as an                                        augmentation to intelligent control and diagnostics                             in complex dynamic processes.  The key ideas of                                 the proposed research are (i) a significant                                     improvement in service life could be achieved by a                              small reduction in the system dynamic performance;                              and (ii) impending failures of critical plant                                   components can be predicted in real time.                                       Specifically, prognoses of impending component                                  failures are critical for enhancement of plant and                              personnel safety, improvement of availability and                               operability, and reduction of operational cost.  As                             the science and technology of materials continue to                             evolve, the design methodologies for damage-                                    mitigating control and failure prognostics must have                            the capability of easily incorporating an appropriate                           representation of material properties.  This requires                           augmentation of the current system-theoretic and                                AI-based techniques for synthesis of decision and                               control laws with governing equations and                                       inequality constraints that would model the                                     properties of the materials for the purpose of                                  damage representation and failure prognosis.  The                               major challenge in this research is to extract the                              information from the material properties and then                               utilize this information in a mathematical form for                             synthesizing intelligent control and diagnostic                                 systems.",
