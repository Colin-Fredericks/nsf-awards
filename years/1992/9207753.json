 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymorphism refers to the occurrence of several different                      discontinuous forms within a single interbreeding population, and               frequently involves color.  A number of mechanisms have been                    advanced to explain the occurrence of such polymorphisms, yet the               explanations are seldom conclusive.  The proposal here focuses on               the fact that polymorphism frequently appear in an intermittent                 fashion among representatives of any given lineage.  The study                  focuses on the Hawaiian spider Theridion grallator which                        demonstrates a highly visible state of polymorphism.  The pattern               of inheritance of the polymorphism in T. grallator will be examined             in order to determine:  (1) why different populations appear to                 exhibit modes of inheritance of the polymorphism; and (2) whether               the observed superficial similarities between T. grallator and                  Enoplognatha ovata, a distantly related species, have a similar                 mechanism of inheritance.  The study will then examine the                      distribution of such similar color polymorphism within the spider               lineage, and assesses whether similarities among unrelated                      representatives of the lineage are repeated independent                         evolutionary events or parallel evolution.  Elucidation of the                  mechanisms underlying the intermittent and widespread occurrence of             polymorphism in both natural and applied systems will contribute to             the knowledge of how selection operates.",
