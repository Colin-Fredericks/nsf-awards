The institutes will serve a total of 125                    teacher-leaders who will incorporate a course in Global                         Systems Science into existing high school programs in their                     regions.  Further, these teacher-leaders will assist in the                     education of their colleagues across the nation.  The project                   will begin by inviting 25 teachers to pilot test the Global                     Systems Science materials during the summer of 1992.  These                     participants will help shape the instructional materials and                    several of them will return as staff members during the                         subsequent summer institutes.  During 1993 and 1994, a total                    of four additional institutes will last three weeks and                         accommodate 25 teacher-leaders.  The Global Systems Science                     course materials will form the core curriculum.  Participants                   in all five institutes will visit laboratories and learn                        \"first hand\" about the work of professionals who investigate                    such topics as global climate change, energy efficiency, ozone                  depletion, and other topics.  These participants will also                      receive instruction in how to assess learning, and how to                       become a leader in their district.",
