 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Environmental                    Sciences at the University of Virginia to establish a research                  program for undergraduates where basic principles of ecology will               be taught, and the methods by which scientists increase our                     understanding of the natural will be detailed.  Two major                       objectives will be to:  1) teach students that science is a process             of acquiring evidence and making inference, and not a collection of             immutable facts; and 2) increase the ecological and environmental               literacy of scientists, professionals, and policy makers.  The                  program will include a diversity of students in terms of their                  interests, backgrounds, and career goals--participants will be                  recruited from the hundreds of colleges/universities in the mid-                Atlantic area.  The focus of the program is on testing hypotheses               related to plant-animal interactions, a topic of considerable basic             and applied interest, and one that has considerable heuristic                   value.  Students will conduct research in a field-station setting               at the Blandy Experimental Farm, a biological field station of the              University of Virginia, and will be immersed in a community of 15               to 20 graduate/post-doctoral researchers.  Field trips will focus               on issues related to conservation; a weekly seminar series at the               Farm will also add to the research experience.  Faculty wages, and              fees for laboratory space and dorm rooms will be contributed as                 cost share items.",
