 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will attempt to quantify the effects of sea ice and                ice transport on the presence and persistence of high latitude                  oceanic salinity anomalies, and , more generally, on the                        circulation of the global oceans.                                                                                                                               Past global modelling efforts have included only rudimentary ice                dynamics and thermodynamics, while sea ice models have generally                neglected the large-scale oceanic effects of the sea ice.  This                 project will couple an ice-ocean model that includes full sea ice               dynamics to a baroclinic ocean model.  By varying the fraction of               the included global ocean, the sea ice effect can be explicitly                 demonstrated.                                                                                                                                                   A series of numerical studies will be concerned with the question               of how critical ice export, or equatorward ice transport, is on                 regional salinity budgets, and how much of a variation in the ice               budget can affect the thermohaline circulation of geographically                realistic ocean basins.  After separate studies of the northern and             southern hemisphere ice-ocean circulation models, a complete model              will be constructed for the Atlantic Ocean.  With this model it is              anticipated that an asymmetrical global mode of the thermohaline                circulation can be obtained, which may then be perturbed in order               to assess the global-scale effect of modified ice transport from                the Arctic Basin and the Antarctic circumpolar region.",
