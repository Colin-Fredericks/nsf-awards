 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research offers a new and novel approach for the                           development of high-technology materials in the separations                     field, namely, a multidimensional route to the significant                      problem of synthetic membrane design.  It follows naturally                     the highly regarded recent research of the PI and his co-                       workers who, through their work, have advanced the field of                     surface science and membrane technology.  The novelty of                        filling a membrane pore matrix with a polymeric substrate                       which offers the possibility of high specificity and                            selectivity along with high flux rates is the primary target                    of most membrane development research within the separations                    area.  Specifically, the PI proposes to prepare high                            selectivity                                                                     membranes by generating hydrogels within the pore matrix and                    by adsorption of block co-polymers on the pore wall structure.                                                                                                  The fundamental studies herein proposed will be to quantify                     the resulting mated matrix with the ensuring field enhanced                     mass transport via continuum convection, diffusion, and by                      electrophoresis.                                                                                                                                                The research proposed, although logical and inclusive (i.e.,                    the research progresses from the preparation of membrane                        materials to the experimental data collection phase, from                       which the quantitative aspects of the characterization of the                   basic processes via analysis of the matrix substrate leads to                   theoretical model development) it is not fully detailed.  The                   PI must consider the ultimate stability of the matrix                           substrate, the potentially manifold mating problems inherent                    in substrate-matrix surface interaction, and the selection of                   appropriate test materials for the study.  The work, although                   fundamental in nature, has some very definite practical                         applicability toward the long sought goal of tailoring                          membranes for specific separation problems of industrial                        significance.  Thus, despite the relative paucity, of                           experimental detail included in the proposal, the PI has an                     outstanding record of research achievement and this work,                       though somewhat speculative, has the potential for major                        contributions to the field of molecular separations.  This is                   of especial interest to the area of synthetic and biological                    macromolecules.",
