 "awd_abstract_narration": "The export of organic matter from the ocean's surface is an                     important biological and chemical process.  Biologically, this                  export feeds most deeper dwelling organisms, and chemically it                  influences the exchange of gases like carbon dioxide and oxygen                 with the atmosphere.  Export usually is defined in terms of carbon.             A common approach is to estimate carbon export from a limiting                  nutrient such as the new (nitrate) component of total plankton                  production by assuming that 6.6 atoms of carbon are exported for                each atom of new production.  However, this gear ratio (one of the              Redfield ratios) between the surface water carbon and nitrogen                  cycles has never been rigorously examined.  Recent measurements in              diverse ocean areas indicate that the net change in inorganic                   carbon associated with new production exceeds that predicted from               the Redfield conversion by more than 50%.  Thus, current concepts               or nutrient cycling in the ocean may be seriously flawed and the                role or the ocean as a carbon sink and as an O2 source may be                   significantly underestimated.  This research represents the first               quantitative study of the relationship between new production and               net production in terms of both dissolved inorganic carbon and O2               with incubation experiments that can isolate the biological                     processes from the confounding effects of mixing and gas exchange.              These experiments will provide critical relationships that are                  needed for more accurate estimates of oceanic carbon and oxygen                 fluxes.  The differential recycling of carbon and nitrogen as a                 reason why the Redfield C:N conversion fails in surface water will              also be evaluated.",
