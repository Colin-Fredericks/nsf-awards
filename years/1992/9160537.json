 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light signals pass through optical processors via an                            interconnecting system of wave guide structures.  Fluorinated                   polymers, because of their outstanding properties, are logical                  materials for use in fabricating these structures.                              Fluoropolymers can be paired with other plastics of ceramics of                 higher refractive index and \"potentially\" fabricated into wave                  guide structures using an innovative micromachining technique                   known as LIGA Microforming.  The ultimate goal of this program                  (Phase I and II) is the direct fabrication of wave guide                        structures by X-ray or deep UV lithography.                                                                                                                     New resist materials with outstanding sensitivity, contrast,                    resolution, and adhesion are required for the \"Thick film\"                      coatings necessary for micromachining.  These resists will be                   designed in the Phase I program.  For the Phase I effort, we will               synthesize two promising candidates poly (trifluoroethyl                        methacrylate) and poly (hexafluoroisopropyl methacrylate) and                   evaluate resist performance for both X-ray and deep UV exposure.                Each fluorinated monomer will be copolymerized with 3-oximino-2                 butanone methacrylate to give improved sensitivity for deep-UV                  exposure.  The two copolymers will be evaluated for deep-UV                     properties neat and also sensitized with p-t-butylbenzoic acid.                 The four polymers will be chemically characterized and tested for               application properties, sensitivity to deep-U and X-ray                         (homopolymers only), contrast, resolution, and refractive index                 versus wavelength.  The developer and rinse cycle will be                       optimized for each polymer.  Resist materials and developers from               Phase I will be further optimized in Phase II and used for                      micromachining a wave guide.",
