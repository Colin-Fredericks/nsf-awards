 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments in politics and economics focus attention on                how outcomes are determined by the interaction between                          institutional structure and individual preferences.  The projects               will endogenize the institutional structure by considering the case             in which multiple institutions compete for members.  Examples                   include the interaction between the membership and platforms of                 political parties and the interaction between towns' inhabitants                and their provision of local public goods.                                                                                                                      At an abstract level, institutions take positions based on their                membership, while individuals join institutions based on their                  preferences.  There is a fundamental interaction between individual             preferences, institutional decision-making processes, memberships,              and outcomes.  In a political economic equilibrium, no individual               wants to change institutional affiliation and each institution's                position is consistent with its membership.  This research begins               with the question of whether an equilibrium exists.  To answer this             apparently simple question requires highly sophisticated reasoning.             Conditions for existence will be derived and the potential for non-             existence will be shown.  The goal of the research is to improve                our understanding of the influence of mobility among competing                  institutions in determining political and economic outcomes.",
