The conference will organize the consortium and develop a program               of activities for it, including centralized research information,               personnel exchanges, research development, resources development,               training, and communications (newsletters and journals).  Open                  invitations will be issued to all sociolegal research institutions.             Representatives will be able to participate in organizing the                   consortium and to form transnational research groups to carry out               specific research projects which will be identified at the                      conference.  Possible research topics include immigration,                      HIV/AIDS, the legal profession, bankruptcy, legal services, social              protection, law and feminism, and environmental regulation.                                                                                                     The conference will not only provide an opportunity for                         international collaboration and exchange among sociolegal scholars,             it will establish a viable and active consortium of research                    institutions from around the world which will lead to a higher                  level of transnational research and a greater multinational and                 multicultural sensitivity to sociolegal research than would                     otherwise be possible.  Also, it will initiate a system of                      international data access which will reap substantial rewards.",
