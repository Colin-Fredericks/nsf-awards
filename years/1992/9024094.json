 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the research collaboration of                           Alwyn Gentry of the Missouri Botanical Garden and                               Ricardo Rueda, a Nicaraguan graduate student in                                 biology at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.  The                          project aims to elucidate the taxonomic relationships                           within Petrea, an important and poorly understood                               neotropical genus of about 30 plant species.                                                                                                                    The last taxonomic treatment of Petrea was done over                            50 years ago.  The limits of the taxa are unclear and                           their interrelationships need reevaluation.  Very                               little is known about Petrea's ecology, cytology,                               anatomy, phylogeny, and pollination biology.  Because                           its species can be propagated by seed, seeds will be                            collected and germinated for root tip chromosome                                counts.  Differences between trees and lianas in the                            genus will be investigated to see how they have                                 originated and what anatomical features differentiate                           the two life forms.  Both the U.S. and Nicaraguan                               sides will benefit from acquiring new data about this                           little-known genus.  The U.S. side will gain from                               _______ and the Nicaraguan collaborator will acquire                            training in modern techniques of systematic biology                             and field-oriented research, needed to help train the                           next generation of Nicaraguan botanists.",
