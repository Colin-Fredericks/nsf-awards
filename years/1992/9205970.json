 "awd_abstract_narration": "Apical meristems are responsible for the production of the entire               postembryonic plant, aerial and subterranean. The sites at which                meristems are initiated, and their patterns of development,                     growth, and arrest are responsible for the establishment of the                 architectural patterns of the shoot and root systems. These                     architectural patterns contribute to the overall light harvesting               efficiency, water and nutrient absorption, and productivity of                  the plant. For these reasons, and for gaining increased                         understanding of basic plant developmental processes, it is                     important to analyze the ways in which meristems are initiated,                 organized, and function. The experiments that Dr. Sussex will                   carry out are based on the assumption that the initiation and                   organization of lateral root meristems represents a developmental               pathway consisting of a sequence of genetically controlled                      molecular and cellular events. The experiments are designed to                  dissect this pathway in the following ways. First, he will define               cellular events that occur early in lateral root meristem                       formation, including the contribution of cell cycle events and                  the role of cortical microtubule arrays; second, he will analyze                the regulation of genes that are expressed during initiation and                early development of lateral root meristems; third, he will                     isolate, map, and analyze mutants in lateral root meristem                      initiation and organization, and order the pathway into a                       temporal sequence. He will relate the cellular and molecular                    aspects of lateral root development genetically by comparing them               in wild type and in mutants for lateral root development, and                   experimentally by uncoupling lateral root development from cell                 division and DNA replication.",
