 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent U/TH and 14C measurements by Bard et al. (1990) on                  corals from Barbados have indicated that 20,000 years ago the                   activity of 14C in the atmosphere was approximately 50% higher than             the modern activity.  They ascribed this increase in activity to                enhanced 14C productions due to more intense cosmic radiation as                a result of a weaker terrestrial dipole magnetic field.  We propose             to test this origin for the 14C enhancement by reconstructing the               deposition of another cosmogenic radionuclide, 36C1.  A similar                 enhancement of the 36C1 would demonstrate that both nuclides were               responding to production fluctuations.  We propose to sample                    atmospheric 36C1 preserved in fossil packrat (Neotoma) urine in an              arid site in western Nevada.  This site contains a midden that has              been 14C dated to cover the time interval 29,000 to 3,000 years                 before present.  If strong correlation of the 36C1 and the Barbados             14C records is found, the 36C1 data might help to reconstruct                   atmospheric 14C activity during the period 30,000 to 20,000 years               B.P., for which other data are scarce.  We will also compare                    36C1/C1 ratios in midden samples from western Nevada and other                  widely spread localities with meteoric 36C1 ratios in the same                  localities in order to establish the relationship between the rat               urine and soil-water 36C1.  In addition to addressing the problem               of secular variations in cosmogenic nuclide production, the record              of variation in meteoric 36C1 may provide a valuable dating agent               for goundwater and soil water.",
