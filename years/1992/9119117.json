 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growth and development in plants is a complex process wherein                   environmental and physical factors interact substantially with the              genotype to determine the actual form of a plant in a particular                environment.  Apical dominance (correlative inhibition and control              of lateral branching) is a hormonally regulated process whereby a               growing shoot apical meristem controls the development and growth               of axillary buds, and thus has a major impact on the shape a plant              attains. The research proposed herein utilizes modern genetic                   methods to identify, characterize and clone genes which are                     responsible for the phenotypic expression of decreased apical                   dominance (increased branching) in Petunia hybrida.  A study of the             genes which control apical dominance will provide insight into the              mechanisms underlying correlative inhibition.  The knowledge                    provided by this research will further the understanding of the                 molecular and physiological processes controlled by these genes.                In the long term the intent is to use this knowledge and genetic                materials to investigate the biochemistry and physiology of                     correlative inhibition.",
