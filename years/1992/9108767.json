 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                      (EPSCoR) in the state of Mississippi will enhance the                           research competitiveness of approximately 20 researchers                        from institutions of the Mississippi Research Consortium                        (MRC).  MRC is a coalition formed in November 1986 by                           Mississippi's four largest institutions of higher learning:                     Mississippi State University, Jackson State University, the                     University of Mississippi, and the University of Southern                       Mississippi.  The researchers are organized in three                            research clusters focused on the broad disciplines of                           chemistry/materials science.  The research areas are:  (1)                      Composite Materials; (2) Advanced Polymeric Materials                           Laboratory; and (3) Structure and Dynamic Analysis.  The                        Mississippi EPSCoR Project is a major catalyst for the                          creation of a mechanism to develop a functional state-wide                      research infrastructure.  The chief research officers                           constitute the Board of both the Consortium and the EPSCoR                      Executive Committee.  The cooperation among the state's                         research institutions has resulted in a demonstrated                            successful cooperative research effort, the sharing of                          expertise and scientific equipment, and the coordination of                     efforts to address major projects.  This collaboration among                    the universities has created opportunities for stronger                         interaction with state, federal, and private entities.  The                     state has committed in excess of $11 million as an                              investment in EPSCoR's objectives for the duration of this                      three-year award.",
