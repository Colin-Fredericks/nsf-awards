More                      specifically, the project seeks to do the following:  to                        examine how and which technological innovations are being                       used in the teaching of science and mathematics; to examine                     how technology is being used to link scientists, science and                    mathematics educators, and other professionals together; to                     determine what has worked, how well and why; and to explore                     new advances in technology that have implications for                           education.  As a result of the findings, a teacher                              enhancement program will be designed for grades K-12 for                        effective use of technology in the teaching of science and                      mathematics.",
