 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although stems are the second most important photosynthetic                organ, very little is known about stem photosynthesis.  Little is               known about adaptation or acclimation of stem photosynthesis to                 different climatic conditions.  Studies of comparative leaf                     photosynthesis on plants from different climates have been                      pivotal to understanding the mechanisms by which plants survive                 in a diversity of habitats.  Similar studies on stem                            photosynthesis, particularly in mediterranean and desert taxa,                  are required to understand the significance of stem                             photosynthesis.  The objective of this proposal is to measure                   stem photosynthesis for mediterranean and desert taxa during the                winter and summer.  Comparisons of these results will test for                  stem photosynthetic adaptation to these different habitats.                     Furthermore, a mathematical model of canopy stem photosynthesis                 will be developed.  The model will be able to predict the                       importance of stem photosynthesis to a diversity of species in a                series of different habitats.                                                        This research will greatly expand our knowledge about the                  significance of stem photosynthesis to plants.  This information                can be applied to analyses of plant success in various                          environments.  Furthermore, the data collected in this study are                crucial for understanding the importance of stem photosynthesis                 to growth of legume crops in agroecosystems.",
