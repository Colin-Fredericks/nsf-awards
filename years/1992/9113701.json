 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports collaborative research in statistical            mechanics between Fa Y. Wu, Northeastern University with Jean-                  Marie Maillard, University of Paris.  They will collaborate on                  models of critical point phenomena, such as boiling and freezing,               and phase transitions.  They will examine the chiral Potts model,               gauge transformations, other 3-state vertex models and the theory               of transmissivity as applied to these models.  The investigators will           focus on exact solutions, but will also utilize numerical approaches            and computer simulation, which is important to finding exact                    results. Analytical studies and computer simulations will be                    performed by Wu and Maillard on massive parallel computers.                                                                                                     Critical point phenomena and phase transitions are active areas of              research in condensed matter theory.  This work also impacts                    theoretical physics and applied mathematics.  Dr. Wu is a                       theoretician.  He will provide theoretical guidance and analytical              expertise.  Dr. Maillard is experienced in computer simulations on              the chiral Potts model and other 3-state vertex models.  The project            will benefit from their complementary expertise and parallel                    computer facilities.",
