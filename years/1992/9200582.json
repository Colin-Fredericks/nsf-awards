 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is to provide partial support of a                  meeting on phospholipases sponsored by the Federation of American               Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB).  This is the second                 meeting on this topic sponsored by FASEB and it will be held at the             Vermont Academy in Saxons River, Vermont, July 12-17, 1992.   There             is no other conference dedicated to these ubiquitous and important              esterases.  All aspects of their chemistry will be covered in                   invited talks, discussion sessions, and poster presentations.                   These include structure and mechanism of the enzymes, intracellular             phospholipase A2, phospholipase C, signal transduction and cellular             activation, function of extracellular and secretory phospholipase               A2, calcium-independent phospholipase A2, phospholipase                         implications, membrane interactions, and relevant phospholipases.               The meeting will bring together a world class group of                          investigators.  Speakers have been chosen for their state of the                art research and ability to communicate.  Special efforts and                   support will be made to attract young investigators, including                  graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  The next FASEB                     phospholipase conference will probably be held two years from this              one.                                                                            %%%                                                                             Phospholipases are hydrolytic enzymes which cleave specific                     phospholipid moieties (fatty acids or polar head groups) at                     specific positions on the glycerol backbone.  The resulting                     cleavage products have specific functions in the cell (e.g., as                 second messengers for signal transduction).  Thus, the control of               phospholipase activities are important for normal cellular                      functions.  Accordingly, an understanding of the specificity of                 both the enzymatic reaction and the regulation of the enzyme                    activity, are critical to an understanding of cellular regulation.              This is an extremely important and intensely active field of                    research, and it is crucial that scientists involved in this work               get together on a regular basis to exchange ideas and introduce                 junior scientists into the research field.  This meeting serves                 those purposes.",
