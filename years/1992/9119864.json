 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the beginning, the discipline of finite geometry was                    motivated by questions in geometry and recreational mathematics.                From the earliest questions that were asked, it was clear that                  the natural setting for the emerging discipline was group theory.               The discipline was enriched and invigorated by the needs of                     statisticians in the design of experiments, but the foundational                questions and the relationship with group theory continued to                   dominate the subject throughout the first half of the twentieth                 century.  The most recent enrichment of the discipline has come                 from the applied problems which gave rise to algebraic coding                   theory.  The achievement most visible to those outside the field                was the computer proof of the non-existence of a projective plane               of order ten, a result that rested heavily on the contributions                 of algebraic coding theory.  This result has spurred the interest               in the interaction of algebraic coding theory and finite geometry               and there is currently a renewed interest in nets and the                       classification problems involving finite projective planes.  On                 the other hand, the classification of finite simple groups has                  given rise to a renewed interest by group theorists in finite                   geometry and the language of diagrams has provided a framework                  for the discussion of the relationship of groups to geometry.                   Finally, traditional classification problems (e.g., difference                  sets, generalized quadrangles and translation planes) continue to               be of interest.                                                                      This project will support the Conference on Finite Geometry                to be held April 11-14, 1992 at Lehigh University.  This meeting                will overlap the Eastern Regional Meeting of the American                       Mathematical Society at which there will be a Special Session on                finite geometry.  The format of this conference is expected to be               similar to the Oberwolfach model.",
