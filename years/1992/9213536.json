 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to develop and field-test a new                remote-sensing device which will be capable of quantifying the rate             of emission of carbon dioxide gas during volcanic eruptions. The                prototype instrument, a portable infrared absorption spectrometer,              will be designed to measure the carbon dioxide content in a line-               of-sight through a volcanic eruption plume and to sort out the                  signal (the carbon dioxide in the plume) from noise (the normal                 background carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere). The                       instrument package will be designed for use either in airplanes or              ground locations.                                                                    Although carbon dioxide is the second most abundant volcanic               gas (after water), little is known about either the total amounts               emitted by active volcanos during eruption or the variation in                  emission level during the evolution of an eruption. The ability to              remotely measure the flux of carbon dioxide is of importance for                a variety of reasons. The origin of the Earth's atmosphere is                   ultimately related to volcanic degassing, and we cannot understand              the significance of anthropogenic contributions unless we have a                handle on the natural sources and their variation over time. Major              volcanic eruptions, well quantified, could be used as natural                   experiments to evaluate the impact of greenhouse gases on climate.                                                                                              In addition, monitoring of carbon dioxide emissions can be used to              predict the course of volcanic eruptions and their local, regional,             and global consequences.",
