 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to investigate analytically and               numerically an inverse scattering problem that arises in neutron                reflection physics.  One seeks to recover the neutron interaction               potential, which is a bounded, real valued function defined on                  the real line, that is zero to the left of the origin, and                      approaches a nonzero constant as the space variable tends to                    positive infinity.  The information to be used for the                          reconstruction is the amplitude of the reflection coefficient                   corresponding to a wave incoming from the left, defined in the                  usual quantum mechanical sense.  Because the reflection                         coefficient is in general complex valued, the missing phase                     information is the central difficulty, and in fact this problem                 is closely related to the well known phase retrieval problem in                 optics.  However, even if the full complex reflection amplitude                 were known, the problem still presents some new aspects, in                     comparison with standard formulations of inverse scattering for                 the Schrodinger equation, because of the fact that the potential                does not decay to zero.  The investigator will also consider some               cases in which the phase data are partially known.  In the                      neutron scattering application, one may usually assume that the                 potential does not have any bound states, and this hypothesis is                essential for the main line of approach.  Nevertheless the case                 when bound states are present is of some interest also, so an                   alternative procedure allowing for this possibility will be                     investigated.                                                                        A newly emerging technology for the detailed analysis of                   chemical and magnetic properties of layered materials is the use                of neutron reflectivity data.  For example, there are many                      applications to the study of surface and interface structure at                 the molecular level for polymer blends.  This in turn is a                      valuable tool in the development of new high performance                        materials.  In a typical experimental set up, a beam of neutrons                is incident from a vacuum region onto a reflecting material,                    whose material properties vary only in the direction                            perpendicular to the material surface.  An instrument called the                neutron reflectometer measures the reflected neutron intensity                  with high precision as a function of the particle's momentum in                 the direction perpendicular to the surface.  These data are thus                dependent in some manner on the so-called neutron interaction                   potential, which is a function of location within the material.                 If this potential can be determined, then other physical                        properties of the material can be directly inferred.  The                       proposed research addresses directly the problem of interpreting                reflectivity data in order to determine the interaction                         potential.  Specifically, the investigator seeks to understand                  the mathematical structure of the problem, and to develop                       accurate and reliable computational procedures.",
