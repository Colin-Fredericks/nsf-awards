 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intermediate geometry of carbonyl/Lewis acid complexes in                   reactions encompassing nucleophilic addition to saturated                       ketones, the conjugate nucleophilic addition to enones, and 2 +                 4 cycloadditions will be investigated.  By use of carefully                     designed adamantone, decalone, and sterically-directed decalone                 systems, the controlled pi-binding of a variety of Lewis acids                  to the carbonyl center will be studied by measuring the extent                  of binding and the resultant effect on chemical reactivity. The                 reaction rates of 1,2- and 1,4- nucleophilic additions and 2 +                  4 cycloadditions will be measured for systems in which Lewis                    acid binding to the ketone moiety is in-plane with the ketone                   as well as via a pi-complex type geometry.  Differences between                 transition and main group metal based Lewis acid will be                        evaluated, and the effect of saturated versus unsaturated                       carbonyls on the thermodynamic preference for Lewis acid                        complexation geometry will be defined.                                          %%%                                                                             One of the most important aspects of modern chemical research                   is to define on a molecular level the factors which accelerate                  reactions and provide for clean, efficient generation of                        specific targeted products.  This grant from the Organic                        Dynamics Program supports the continuing investigation of the                   acid catalysis of three important classes of chemical reactions                 by Professor R. C. Corcoran at the University of Wyoming.  The                  investigation is targeted toward synthesis of chemical species                  with geometrical constraints that provide specific binding of                   metallic acid catalysts. Such processes are critical in                         designing new catalysts with increased efficiency,  and will be                 of significant benefit in controlling synthetic processes of                    technical importance.",
