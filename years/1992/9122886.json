 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many recent contributions to the econometrics literature have                   proposed and analyzed \"plug-in\" semiparametric estimators.  Such                estimators replace unknown density or regression functions by                   nonparametric estimators of those functions.  While theory states               that these nonparametric estimators are \"better\" because they are               able to capture all nuances in the structure of econometric                     relationships in large samples, this does not assure that they                  will always produce better answers in either small or moderately                sized samples.  In particular, since an infinite series expansion               must always be truncated, or a finite approximation region chosen               for a local average estimator, there is the real possibility that               nonparametric estimators can contain systematic biases, because                 of their construction.  In other words, the remainder terms that                modern theorists easily show vanish in large samples could                      actually be large, and systematic in onerous ways.  This is a                   particularly dangerous possibility for econometric results, since               such semiparametric estimators could naturally be interpreted as                less biased than their more restricted parametric counterparts.                 The contribution of this project comes from measuring the                       significance of the biases in these estimators and developing                   ways of correcting for them.                                                                                                                                    In particular, this research will show how derivatives or                       elasticities computed from local smoothing estimators display                   systematic downward bias.  As such, measured derivatives from                   kernel regression and kernel density estimators are too small on                average.  The project demonstrates how large such bias will                     typically be, and proves theoretically why such biases arise                    naturally.  Corrections for this bias are studied.  This work                   involves both theoretical development and computer simulation.                  The project also continues research on average derivative                       estimation, a particular semiparametric approach.  Questions to                 be addressed include the calculation and implementation of                      optimal bandwidths for average derivatives, as well as how to                   measure discrete variable coefficients in index models.",
