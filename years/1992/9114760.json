 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Field Museum  of Natural History houses the third largest                   collection of scientific bird specimens (>380,000) in North                     America and the fourth largest such collection in the world.                    These specimens are used by researchers around the world in their               basic research on the nature and origins of biotic diversity.                   Increasingly, conservation biologists are turning to collections                such as this for the basic distributional and natural history                   information that is required if efforts to conserve biotic                      diversity are to be successful.  In addition, Field Museum staff                use the collections extensively when teaching undergraduates and                graduates at Chicago area universities, and when constructing                   exhibits designed for the very young.  However, the sheer                       magnitude of this collection has limited in some senses limited                 its usefulness.  Obtaining some kinds of information can be a                   very time consuming process.                                                         The current project is intended to make these collections                  more accessible to Field Museum scientific staff as well as to                  the broader scientific and educational communities.  The first                  phase of collection computerization (entry of specimen data into                a relational database) has been completed.  However, only those                 data present in the written catalog have been entered and these                 data have not yet been thoroughly proofed.  In this project we                  will proof the recently constructed database to insure accuracy                 and will add additional information about each specimen.  Until                 each record has been examined against the associated specimen,                  the utility of that database will be limited.",
