 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paterson will investigate the long-standing problem of higher              dimensional cohomology for operator algebras, and clarify the                   difference between amenability and strong amenability for C*-                   algebras.  He will also study amenable C*-algebras in terms of                  complete boundedness, and investigate the role of amenable                      foliations in understanding the C*-algebras associated with groups.             This work will be based on the recently discovered equivalence of               amenability of C*-algebras and the existence of a right invariant               mean on a certain space of functions on its unitary group.                           The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently                being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
