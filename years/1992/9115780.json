 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study will test the hypothesis that Creede                    Formation sediments (Colorado) were a major source of mineralizing              fluids for the Creede ore district and will quantitatively evaluate             the geochemical and isotopic evolution of pore waters in the Creede             Formation.  The Creede Formation sediments have undergone a                     complicated history that appears to include low temperature                     alteration by fluids of controversial salinity and later                        hydrothermal alteration.  The project will involve a combined                   observational and computational study to characterize the sediments             and porewaters of the Creede Formation.  Previously collected                   outcrop samples and core samples from two planned drill holes                   undertaken as part of the Continental Scientific Drilling Program               will be studied.  The mineralogy, texture, chemical and stable                  isotopic composition, and age of chemical sediments and authigenic              minerals, including zeolites, K-feldspar, clays, carbonates, and                saline minerals will be characterized.  Analytical techniques will              include XRD, petrography, SEM, electron microprobe, stable isotope              geochemistry, and laser 39Ar/40Ar and K/Ar age dating.  The principal           investigators will work closely with Robert Rye (USGS, Denver) and              Marvin Lansphere (USGS, Menlo Park) in the collection and                       interpretation of stable and radiogenic isotope data.  They will                also develop quantitative models of the diagenetic alteration of                Creede sediments using a geochemical and isotopic mass transfer                 computer program.  They also hope to gain new insights into this                and other similar systems by incorporating a broad spectrum of                  mineralogical and geochemical methods with state-of-the-art                     geochemical and isotopic modeling to develop and integrated model               of the depositional, diagenetic, and hydrothermal history of the                Creede Formation.",
