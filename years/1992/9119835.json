 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans are transforming the upland landscapes of Amazonia from                  nearly continuous expanses of high forest to mosaics of pasture,                secondary forests, logged forests and primary forest remnants.                  The large-scale ecological changes that accompany this radical                  alteration of Earth's biosphere are poorly understood, but                      probably very important.  For example, the best predictions of                  regional climatic impacts of this transformation suggest that                   Amazonia will be drier and warmer in the years to come and that                 climatic shifts may follow in the grain belt of south-central                   Brazil.                                                                                                                                                         Our poor ability to predict the consequences of Amazonian                       deforestation can be traced to a surprising dearth of comparative               information for primary forests and the anthropogenic ecosystems                that are replacing them, particularly in the major zone of forest               conversion extending from Belem south to Goiania and west to                    Acre.  For example, there are no published studies comparing the                hydrology of primary and secondary ecosystems of this 1.2 M km2                 region.  The only estimates of evapotranspiration and water                     balance for Amazonian ecosystems based on empirical measurements                were conducted on primary forests in central and northern                       Amazonia, far from the advancing agricultural frontier.                                                                                                         It is hypothesized that the deep soils and pronounced seasonal                  drought that characterize the \"arc of forest conversion\" support                deep-rooted primary forests that use water and mineral nutrients                in ways that are not predicted by the existing literature on                    moist tropical forest ecology.  Deep-soil functions of these                    forests, including carbon storage, dry season water uptake, wet                 season water storage, fine root production, and nutrient uptake                 are the least studied aspects of moist tropical forest and yet                  must be understood to predict the ecological changes that will                  accompany forest conversion.                                                                                                                                    This research on water use by deep-rooted, Amazon forests and the               ecosystems that are replacing these forests will assist in                      testing the hypothesis above.  Results from initial studies                     suggest that the new ecosystems of Amazonia are relatively                      shallow-rooted and functionally distinct.  This study will                      provide the basis for development of a model relating seasonal                  patterns of rainfall to root and canopy dynamics in deep-rooted,                moist tropical forests.",
