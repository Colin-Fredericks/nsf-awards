 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interpretation of the climatic impact of variations in the                 earth's orbital mechanisms has progressed in recent decades to                  the point where individual mid-monthly caloric insolation totals                are now available.  Each refinement of these insolation                         variations has produced new insights into the influence of the                  earth's orbital mechanisms on the climate of the planet.  This is               important because disagreement exists about the ability of the                  current Milankovitch orbital theory of climatic change to explain               conflicting signals found in certain climate proxy records.  The                problems associated with this theory can be evaluated and                       possibly resolved through further refinements in the orbital                    influence down to the diurnal level.  This study continues that                 process of refinement by defining the variations in the diurnal                 (daily) cycle of specific mid-monthly insolation totals by means                of a computer simulation model.   The results should help to                    resolve past discrepancies in the paleoclimatic proxy data                      record.                                                                              By expanding previous Milankovitch insolation studies to the               diurnal scale, this project opens new avenues of investigation                  and suggests the need for re-examination of previous studies of                 climatic change.  In particular, a more precise record can be                   established regarding the termination of glacial periods, the                   occurrence of paleomonsoon events, and the fluctuations in sea-                 level rise.",
