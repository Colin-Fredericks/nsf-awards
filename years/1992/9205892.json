 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Rowlett will isolate and purify carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme               thought to be important species such as corn.  Once isolated in                 pure form, he will examine the structure of the enzyme and several              laboratory-modified derivatives using UV-visible spectroscopy, and              powerful X-ray absorption techniques.  Dr.  Rowlett also proposed               to investigate the catalytic role of plant carbonic anhydrase in                detail using nuclear magnetic resonance and stopped-flow                        spectroscopy methods which are capable of picking apart individual              chemical steps in their mechanism of action.                                    %%%                                                                             Although carbonic anhydrases of animal origin are well-known, plant             carbonic anhydrases are poorly understood, and what little is known             indicates that the plant enzyme is evolutionarily distinct from                 carbonic anhydrases of animal origin.  Thus, the characterization               of plant carbonic anhydrases is highly significant, for two                     reasons.  First, plant and animal carbonic anhydrase may represent              one of a few pairs of enzymes in nature which have evolved from                 different origins to arrive at an identical function (convergent                evolution).  By comparing the structures of such convergently                   evolved enzymes, it will likely be possible to distinguish the                  essential and nonessential features of protein structure                        responsible for chemical catalysis.  Second, the study of the                   catalytic ability of plant carbonic anhydrase may help resolve the              exact function of plant carbonic anhydrase in photosynthesis, a                 function that is currently unknown, primarily because of a lack of              fundamental information about the catalytic ability of the enzymes.",
