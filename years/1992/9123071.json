 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this research is the development of a local               and global structural stability theory for parabolic partial                    differential equations and a Floquet theory for time dependent                  linear parabolic equations.  Structural stability was first                     introduced in the study of ordinary differential equations, in                  particular for dynamical systems.  Many concepts of dynamical                   systems have been adapted to infinite dimensional systems,                      especially to partial differential equations which define                       dynamical systems on non-compact spaces.  However, those systems                generated by parabolic equations are not reversible.  This                      characteristic creates difficulties not encountered in the study                of finite dimensional dynamical systems and new methods must be                 developed to understand the nature of these systems.  A theory                  for scalar reaction-diffusion equations has recently been                       obtained.                                                                            Specific classes of equations such as the Cahn-Hilliard                    Equation and Phase-Field System will be considered for specific                 analysis.  Other work will study structural stability of flows                  near periodic solutions for time-periodic parabolic equations.                  In the same spirit, efforts will be made to carry over the                      Floquet theory (too technical to describe here) from finite                     periodic systems to parabolic partial differential equations of                 similar type.",
