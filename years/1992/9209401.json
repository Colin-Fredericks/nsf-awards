 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to determine the function and information                    content of communication vocalizations of a large, omnivorous                   bat, the greater spear-nosed bat.  The rich vocal repertoire,                   unusual social system in which unrelated females form long-                     lasting groups, and proclivity to forage in groups while                        producing loud, audible calls make this bat ideally suited for                  study.                                                                                                                                                          Dr. Wilkinson's research is designed to determine if vocal                      advertisement and group foraging result in reciprocated or                      mutualistic benefits.  To discriminate between these                            alternatives, he will use infrared-sensitive video and                          computerized recording equipment to conduct observations and                    playback experiments on individually marked bats departing from                 cave roosts or foraging in groups during three months of field                  work in Trinidad, West Indies.  Acoustic analysis of bat                        vocalizations recorded in the field from known individuals will                 be used to indicate the type of information that could be                       contained in particular calls.  Behavioral experiments designed                 to measure the energetic benefits of group foraging and                         information exchange, as well as the mechanism by which                         information is transferred, will be conducted on captive bats at                the National Zoo, Washington, D.C., over a seven-month period.                                                                                                  Reciprocal information exchange is common in all human societies                but is unknown for other vertebrates with the possible exception                of chimpanzees and dolphins.  This research should, therefore,                  add to our understanding of communication and cooperation in bats               and provide insight into the evolution of cooperative                           communication.  In addition, because this bat pollinates flowers                and disperses seeds from a variety of tropical trees, an improved               understanding of its foraging behavior may provide valuable                     information for conserving Latin American rain forests.",
