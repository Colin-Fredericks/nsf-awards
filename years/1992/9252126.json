 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science is                           establishing an Interactive Mathematics Classroom, containing                   16 student workstations and one teacher workstation/file                        server, all Macintosh Quadra 700s.  The goal of the project is                  to have students use the current generation of mathematical                     software to gain mathematical intuition and to apply                            mathematical theory to realistic problems.  The Classroom is                    enabling students to experiment with examples in ways that are                  not possible with the traditional pencil-and-paper approach                     and, in addition, is allowing those who are being trained as                    teachers to gain needed hands-on exposure to mathematical                       software.  A unique feature of the Classroom is the network                     software, featuring screen sharing as well as file and resource                 sharing.  This permits automated interaction between instructor                 and students and high quality access to mathematical software                   including Mathematica and MATLAB.  The first classes to use the                 Interactive Mathematics Classroom are those designed for                        prospective K-8 teachers, covering number systems, geometry,                    and functions.  In the second year of the project, the                          classroom will be used to augment standard mathematics                          instruction in linear algebra, differential equations, number                   theory, geometry, and linear optimization.",
