 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in                marine geology between Donald F. McNeill of the University of                   Miami and Djafar Aissaoui of the University of Paris (South).  The              objective of their research is to calibrate and refine the timing of            geodynamic events associated with an active, subducting plate                   boundary. The investigators will apply carbonate                                magnetostratigraphy to an uplifted atoll in the Loyalty Islands of              the South Pacific.  Dr. McNeill brings to this collaboration                    experience in rock magnetics and magnetostratigraphic dating of                 shallow-water carbonates.  He has constructed a superconducting                 magnetics laboratory for data analysis.  This is complemented by                Dr. Aissaoui's knowledge about the Atoll's geology and                          stratigraphy.                                                                                                                                                   Carbonate magnetostratigraphy is a novel technique for timing and               determining rates of motion at active plate boundaries and for                  extracting data on past sea level events.  Results from this research           will determine its feasibility for studies at active plate boundaries           and could lead to its widespread use for research in geodynamics                and plate tectonics.",
