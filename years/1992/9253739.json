 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kadonaga is an outstanding young scientist, with an exemplary               research career to date.  His credentials are impeccable, his                   research plan is excellent, and he is already at the forefront of               his field.  The objective of this award is to examine the                       relationship between chromatin structure and gene activity in                   eukaryotes.  Recent findings on the mechanism of transcriptional                activation by sequence specific factors strongly suggest that                   dynamic interactions between chromatin and the transcription                    factors are involved in the regulation of gene expression.  These               transcriptional \"activators\" may actually function as                           antirepressors--that is they appear, at least in part, to                       counteract repression, stems for reconstitution of chromatin will               be developed, and then the resulting chromatin will be used as                  template for in vitro transcription analysis. These studies should              lead to a better understanding of the process of gene activation.               %%%                                                                             The objective of this award is to enhance his research involving                examine the relationship between chromatin structure and gene                   activity in eukaryotes.  Interactions between chromatin and the                 transcription factors are involved in the regulation of gene                    expression.  Transcriptional \"activators may actually function to               counteract repression of basal transcription by chromatin.                      Different systems for reconstitution of chromatin will be                       developed, and then the resulting chromatin will be used as                     template for in vitro transcription analysis.  These studies should             lead to a better understanding of the process of gene activation.               Dr. Kadonaga is exceptionally broad in his research achievements,               as well as in his teaching interests and plans.  He will have an                important impact on a department as distinguished as UCSD's Biology             Department.  There  is no question that he will be a leader in                  biological sciences in the future.",
