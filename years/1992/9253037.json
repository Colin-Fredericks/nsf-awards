 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fisk and Wayne State Universities (located in the urban surroundings            of Nashville and Detroit, respectively) are \"minority institutions\"             with a firm commitment to improve the entry and retention of                    minority students in various fields of science and engineering.  The            overall objectives of the proposed research program are to motivate             and train the undergraduate and graduate minority students by (a)               teaching the basic principles and applications of different                     biological and biochemical techniques in life science research (b)              providing hands-on-experience with laboratory instrumentation (c)               encouraging the students to participate in the proposed research                project on \"Thiol-mediated regulation of yeast-to-mycelial                      dimorphism in Candida albicans\", providing confidence to                        independently conduct experiments involving biochemistry and                    molecular genetics; and (d) providing training in scientific data               collection and presentation to their peers in scientific conference             or meetings.                                                                                                                                                    The specific objectives of the research project are:  (1) study the             effect of various penetrating and non-penetrating thiol-blockers on             the yeast-to-mycelial transition in C. albicans; (2) determine the              levels of key enzymes of the v-glutamyl cycle from the yeast and                mycelial forms of C. albicans to gain insight into the reason for               the rapid decline of intracellular glutathione; (3) The genes                   encoding the enzyme(s) with altered expression concomitant with the             morphological changes will be clones, sequenced and characterized               using gene cloning techniques.  the gene(s) will be isolated form               cDNA and genomic libraries of C. albicans and (4) The cloned gene               (s) from C. albicans will be expressed in E. coil, the gene                     product(s) will be purified and used for molecular and biochemical              studies.                                                                                                                                                        This project would help to increase the number and improve the                  levels of training of minorities and women in life science research.            The implementation of the Research Initiation in Minority                       Institution (RIMI) project at Fisk and Wayne State Universities will            not only improve the quality of the preparation of the students,                which in turn will enhance their chances to enter graduate or                   professional schools, but also will enable the Biology Department at            Fisk to recruit more top quality advanced minority students by                  providing funds for their support.  These students, as research                 participants, will be effective role models for other predominately             black undergraduates at Fisk and Wayne State Universities.",
