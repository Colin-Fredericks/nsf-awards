 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the plans for the National Research and Education                      Network (NREN) have evolved since 1988, they continue to revolve                around a decision for phased implementation that is embedded in                 the larger framework of the High Performance Computing and                      Communications Program (HPCC).  The current phase, now referred                 to as the Interagency Interim NREN, involves extending the reach                of the Internet network complex that includes the NSFNET                        Backbone, midlevels, campus networks that rely on the backbone                  for interconnection, and other federally sponsored networks, all                of which serve the research and education community.  It also                   involves enhancements to the range and quality of network-based                 services.                                                                                                                                                       The National Academy's Computer Science and Telecommunications                  Board (CSTB) will revisit its earlier analysis since 1990 of key                policy and management issues.  It will produce a report following               4 to 5 meetings of its 15 member panel which will take testimony                from outside experts and other members of the Internet networking               community.***",
