 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Harold                   Hochman, Lafayette College, and Giorgio Brosio, University of                   Turin.  The objective of the project is to re-examine, using                    experimental methods, the basic behavioral hypotheses of the                    theory of bureaucracy and agency.  A unique aspect of this project              is its comparative nature.  The project will develop a better                   understanding of the objectives of local politicians and bureaucrats            and re-examine the extent of the principal-agent problem in                     decision-making in both local government and the not-for-profit                 sector.                                                                                                                                                         At a positive level, the project will improve the understanding of              how market and non-market institutions translate the preferences of             constituents or sponsors, through fiscal and regulatory actions, into           agency decisions in government and in private organizations.  At a              normative level, the project will determine how well existing                   institutions perform this function and devise constraints or                    incentives systems to  help managers of public agencies and                     nonprofit organizations serve the interests of their principals.                Attention will initially be directed to three services -- cultural              activities, health and social services, and local transportation -- in          Turin and the Piedmont region in Italy, and in New York City,                   Pittsburgh, and other smaller cities in the northeastern United                 States.  Researchers from Turin have developed and refined some                 of the requisite methods of experimentation and interpretation that             complements those of the American specialists. There are enough                 similarities and differences in fiscal and political responsibilities in        the two countries to define an excellent base for comparative                   analysis.",
