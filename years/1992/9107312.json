 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) is a new experimental                  technique with tremendous potential for site-specific                           characterization of metals in clusters and complex proteins.  Dr.               Cramer proposes to conduct the first-ever XMCD measurements on                  carefully selected paramagnetic transition metal complexes, and to              compare the experimental results with recently developed                        theoretical simulation programs. XMCD experiments will then be                  conducted on small proteins with known metal sites, and the results             compared with data from other methods such as Mossbauer and EPR.                With the experimental and theoretical basis of XMCD established,                he will apply the technique to magnetic and structural questions                about metal centers in the metalloenzymes nitrogenase, hydrogenase,             and photosystem II.                                                                                                                                             To conduct these experiments, he will employ circularly-polarized               soft x-rays emitted as synchrotron radiation from electron storage              rings such as the National Synchrotron Light Source.  Samples will              be placed in the strong magnetic field of a superconducting magnet.             Photoabsorption will be measured directly by the transmission                   method on thin films, and indirectly using sample photocurrent or               fluorescence detection techniques.                                                                                                                              Site-specific characterization of metals in nitrogenase,                        hydrogenase, and photosystem II will allow better understanding and             synthetic modelling of their important catalytic activities.  The               development of this new technique will also provide the                         bioinorganic community with a new tool for magnetic and site-                   specific characterization, and the XMCD techniques will be                      generally applicable to nearly all paramagnetic transition metal                complexes.",
