 "awd_abstract_narration": "To provide the general public with an understanding of the                      basic principles that underlie the transmission, storage, and                   retrieval of information, the Fleet Center proposes to build                    SIGNALS, a 4,500 square foot exhibition.  SIGNALS will be                       divided into three sections, of approximately 15 interactive                    exhibits each, which explore the physical principles of wave                    motion, the properties of electromagnetic pulses useful for                     communications, and the signal processing that enables us to                    handle information.                                                                                                                                             An Advisory Committee comprised of highly qualified                             individuals at the leading edge of their fields will support                    development of SIGNALS; a very experienced team of exhibit                      developers will fabricate the exhibition.  SIGNALS will become                  a permanent exhibition in an expanded Fleet Center, where it                    is expected to attract 1 million visitors a year, including at                  least 100,000 K-12 students.                                                                                                                                    Since the lack of technological understanding is a national                     problem, we propose to build a 3,000 square foot traveling                      version of SIGNALS, contingent upon an NSF review of the                        completed permanent exhibition.  The total cost for both                        exhibitions is $1,983,480.  We are requesting $985,900 from                     NSF:  $692,800 for the permanent exhibition and $293,100 for                    the traveling exhibition.  The project will begin in June,                      1992, and be completed by June, 1996.",
