 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project promises to make a contribution to a newly                         developing area of science and values studies:  interpretative                  studies of science-as-presented in public domains.  The                         investigator will undertake an ethnographic study of the Bradbury               Science Museum, located at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in                New Mexico.  Los Alamos is a principal site in the history of                   nuclear science and weapons.  The Bradbury Museum is charged with               preserving that history, and furthering public understanding of                 how science figures in U.S. defense and energy policies.                        Traditional studies of science communication adopt positivist                   methods to \"measure\" visitor behavior, attitudes and learning.                  Alternately, this study uses participant-observation and informal               interviewing to study the experiences and activities of Museum                  personnel and visitors as they interpret nuclear history.  This                 data can contribute to revisionist theories of science and museum               communication that emphasize the rhetorical dimensions of                       \"texts,\" and the complex, active nature of science learners.  It                also provides insight into the cultural experience of nuclear                   history in the emerging, post-Cold War era.  The Bradbury Museum                is a site where multiple meanings for the institutions and                      legacies of nuclear science are promoted, accommodated, and                     challenged.  This investigation occurs as the Museum is planning                to relocate to a new, downtown Los Alamos site, which adds                      important historical as well as transitional dimensions to this                 research.",
