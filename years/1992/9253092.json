 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although most of the early events immediately following                         fertilization are carried out by maternal factors, the sperm can                play a critical role in these early events by triggering egg                    activation, contributing a centrosome, and specifying one of the                embryonic axes.  However, the identity and function of these                    paternal factors involved in egg activation and early development               remain unclear since the preliminary biochemical studies are                    controversial.                                                                                                                                                  The objective of this project is to initiate a genetic analysis of              these paternally acting factors in the nematode Caenorhabditis                  elegans.  Genetic screens will be carried out identify new                      paternal effect lethal (pel) mutations and to estimate the number               of genes involved.  Phenotypic analysis of these new mutants and                of three previously identified pel mutants (emb-27, and fer-14)                 will be undertaken in order to analyze the function of these                    genes.  The most promising mutations from these studies will be                 selected for subsequent genetic and molecular analysis.",
