 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symmetry plays an important role in nearly all branches of                 science.  This is particularly evident in theoretical physics,                  where representation theory has long been a primary tool.                       Symmetry aspects have only recently been exploited in certain                   branches of mathematics.  In particular, symmetry has only begun                to be exploited in any systematic way in numerical analysis.  In                applied analysis, the study of symmetry is much more well-                      developed.  In the area of classical differential equations, the                understanding of symmetry groups as a central tool has been                     realized since the last century.  In the relatively more recent                 area of bifurcation theory, symmetry has been exploited                         systematically only in recent years.  There is a growing                        collection of researchers in numerical analysis who are currently               attempting to use symmetry groups as a fundamental tool in their                work.                                                                                This project will support the 1992 AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar                 in Applied Mathematics to be held from July 26 - August 1, 1992                 at Colorado State University.  The topic of this conference (the                twenty-second in this series) is Exploiting Symmetry in Applied                 and Numerical Analysis.  The major aim of the conference is to                  provide a wide-ranging survey of the exploitation of symmetry in                applied and numerical analysis.  A purpose of the seminar is to                 stimulate interaction between aspects of applied mathematics                    (e.g., partial differential equations, integral equations,                      bifurcation), numerical mathematics (e.g., numerical linear                     algebra, boundary and finite element methods), core mathematics                 (e.g., representation theory of groups), and classical physics                  (e.g., Taylor and Benard problems).  The seminar will have both                 an entry level summer school component intended for junior                      researchers and a frontier research level aspect.",
