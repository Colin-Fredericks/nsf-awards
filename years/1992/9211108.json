 "awd_abstract_narration": "The numerical simulations of the global climate will be feasible                only with a combined effort in developing appropriate                           parameterizations and filtering techniques for the physical                     equations and in developing scalable parallel algorithms suitable               for future high performance computers.  Parameterizations, which                simplify the model, and filtering, which allows larger explicit                 time steps, have reduced the computational requirements by orders               of magnitudes.  However, even a crude three dimensional global                  resolution of the atmosphere and ocean requires a number of grid                points which swamps all existing computer architectures, even                   with these simplifications.  A brute force approach of using                    larger machines to solve higher resolution problems is not                      sufficient.  The models need further simplification before state-               of-the-art computing will be sufficient to allow reasonable                     predictions of the climate.                                                                                                                                     This research will focus on the simultaneous development process                of both the models and solution methods.  The first goal is to                  identify the computational bottlenecks of existing general                      circulation model implementations on parallel architectures.  By                analyzing the computation and communication complexities of the                 various components of the models, it will be possible to identify               the areas in which there is the greatest need for simplifications               in the model and/or more efficient parallel numerical algorithms.               Next, appropriate data structures must be designed which allow                  for the evolution of the model equations.   Finally, it is                      anticipated that many of the modern numerical methods, such as                  multigrid, GMRES with various parallel preconditioners and domain               decomposition will prove particularly useful.",
