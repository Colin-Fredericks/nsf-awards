 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project includes research into a broad range of topics in             computability theory (recursion theory) and into logic applied to               various areas of computer science.  Included in the first area are              investigations of recursively enumerable sets, several structures               of degrees of complexity from Turing to polynomial time, and the                proof theoretic complexity of some mathematical theorems.  The                  second area of research includes the analysis and development of a              source in nonmonotonic logic, concurrent programming models,                    resource bounded logic, and applications of linear programming                  ideas and algorithms to data structures and logic programming.                       Both theoretical computability questions and more practical                ones are addressed by this project.  The theoretical ones are the               ones in what is known as recursion theory, which deals with a model             of computability knowing no bounds on time or space.  Although                  answers to such questions have the ability to illuminate practical              questions, they are really practical only when their answers are                negative, for it is a very strong statement indeed to say that                  something cannot be computed even when one puts no limits on                    resources available for the purpose.  The finer structure of                    computability theory is even more relevant to actual computations,              and various aspects of that will also be considered.",
