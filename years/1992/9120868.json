Automation will make this metric accessible to many                 more researchers at less cost, while eliminating residual                       interscorer discrepancies.                                                           Measurement of facial expression is valuable in many                       domains, and has led to unique insights in problems as diverse as               human development, sociology, developmental and social                          psychology.  From a practical standpoint, different aspects of                  expression eluicidate whether a listener is empathetic or hostile               (important in politics and business), distinguish abusive from                  nonabusive caretakers (social work), predict divorce in                         dysfunctional married couples, and may incriminate dissembling                  witnesses (forensics).  Reliability of facial expression as a                   gauge of nervous system function has been affirmed through                      autonomic nervous system indices as well as electromyography and                electroencephalography.                                                              Initially, automating measurement of facial movement will                  involve static images of faces of a single subject, which will be               preprocessed to normalize size and brightness, compressed with a                back-propagation image compressor, and fed to a second neural                   network whose output will correspond to the \"action units\" of the               widely used \"Facial Action Coding System.\"  Recent techniques                   such as weight-sharing will be used where necessary.  Recurrent                 networks will be used to allow processing of dynamical                          information, with extension of implementation to multiple                       subjects.                                                                            This methodological advance has the potential for a                        significant contribution to the infrastructure of science in many               domains.",
