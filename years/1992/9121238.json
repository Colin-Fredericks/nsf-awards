 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the processes that shape the development of the                    nervous system and behavior occur during the early neonatal                     period.  Dr. Moore has shown that perineal stimulation provided                 by mothers to their developing offspring during the course of a                 specific maternal behavioral pattern, has long-term consequences                on their adult behavior.  She has also shown that this maternal                 stimulation also produces changes in the central nervous system.                Using an exciting and highly innovative approach, Dr. Moore will                investigate how interactions between environmental stimulation                  and the hormones produced by the developing young work jointly to               produce the enduring changes in the both central nervous system                 and behavior.  She will concentrate on a sexually dimorphic                     nucleus in the lumbar region of the spinal cord.  Using state-of-               the-art anatomical techniques, Dr. Moore will investigate the                   role that cell death plays in regulating the observed differences               in neuron number following variations in maternal stimulation.                  By systematically varying the mother-infant interactions in ways                similar to those experienced naturally by the offspring, the                    effect that early stimulation has on individual differences                     within males and females, and sex differences can be examined.                  At present, little is known about the role of sensory input in                  development of sexual dimorphisms.  Her systematic focus on                     external stimulation and normal sensory input is an excellent                   opportunity to weave functional, anatomical, and developmental                  questions togethers in a meaningful and mutually useful way.  The               outcome is likely to redefine our ideas about the sexual                        differentiation process than is now currently being accepted.",
