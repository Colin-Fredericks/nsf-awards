 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal project will involve 30 elementary and middle                      school teachers in a 2-year program which focuses on                            experiences with chemistry at a level appropriate to teachers                   who have had little or no background in chemistry.  Teachers                    will participate in two intensive 3-week summer workshops in                    chemistry and science methods, and will receive on-site                         support from project personnel during the subsequent academic                   years.  Teachers will also participate in a 3-day session on                    leadership and the presentation of inservices to be held                        during February of the first year.  Project staff will                          provide on-site support as participants incorporate what                        they've learned into their science classes, and as they                         present inservices to their colleagues.  During the course of                   the project, project staff and participants will collaborate                    on the revision and enhancement of Chemistry for Children, an                   activity book of chemistry activities designed for elementary                   and middle school children.                                                                                                                                     This leadership project is appropriate for the Teacher                          Enhancement Program because of its extensive enhancement of                     the science education of elementary and middle school                           teachers and because of its plan for participants to provide                    science inservice for all of the teachers in their respective                   schools.
