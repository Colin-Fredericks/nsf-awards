Melanotropins, (melanocyte-stimulating                  hormones, MSH; melanin-concentrating hormone, MCH) were among the               first peptides to be structurally analyzed and to be chemically                 synthesized.  While their biological effects on pigmentation,                   especially in invertebrate species, have been widely appreciated,               it is clear that melanotropins affect the central nervous system                and specific peripheral organs.  This conference will address the               important advances being made on the biosynthesis, secretion and                molecular mechanisms of action of these peptides.  It covers the                full spectrum of topics from the discovery of MSH to most current               knowledge of its role as neuropeptides.  The conference's format                provides the atmosphere to foster meaningful interchanges between               an interdisciplinary group of scientists.  The final discussion                 will speculate on how these rapid advances in basic research may                lead to the potential clinical use of melanotropins in the                      diagnosis and therapy of melanoma, the treatment of pigment                     disorders, nerve damage and dementia.",
