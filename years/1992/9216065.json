 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this SGER Program proposal is to test both                drifting and moored buoys with a new instrument which measures the              ocean heat flux directly.  Typically, these observations are made               indirectly in the atmosphere above the ocean surface and are both               difficult to make and do not have the desired accuracy.  The new                instrument simulates the \"membrane\" which separates the ocean from              the atmosphere and measures the heat flow through it.  The                      instrument is simple, can be calibrated from first principles, and              will also work in zero wind.                                                                                                                                         These properties make it ideally sited for obtaining heat flux             observations in the warm pool region of the Pacific as part of the              TOGA/COARE, and possibly also the CEPEX, program.  Modelling the                boundary layer in this region is especially difficult because most              algorithms require a wind.  Observations from these devices could               provide key information that should aid in a better understanding               of the boundary layer in this region.  The instrument should work               well in other parts of the ocean as well.                                                                                                                            This research is important because it seeks to improve on                  ability to collect information vital to the study of atmosphere-                ocean interactions related to climate variability and change.",
