 "awd_abstract_narration": "The next Summer School for Chemical Engineering Faculty,                        jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and                        Industry is  organized by the Chemical Engineering Division of                  the American Society for Engineering Education.It will be held                  in the Summer of 1992.  Attendance by about 250 faculty members                 is anticipated, representing nearly every chemical engineering                  department in the United States.  The purpose of the project                    sponsored Summer School is to achieve more effective and                        realistic chemical engineering education by stimulating an                      exchange of ideas and approaches among chemical engineering                     faculty members and practicing engineers.  Past  Summer Schools                 have fostered major innovations in the chemical engineering                     curriculum; the development of new teaching methods and                         classroom activities have also been encouraged.  The format of                  the Summer School includes organized workshops and plenary                      sessions . Continuous opportunity for informal discussion among                 participants also is provided. Eminent engineers from                           universities and industry will be involved in the organization                  and presentation of the Summer School.The subjects to be                        covered represent areas of new and renewed emphasis in chemical                 engineering education .The Summer School offers the opportunity                 to examine and influence the direction of chemical engineering                  education in the United States.  Chemical engineers who are                     capable of meeting modern societal demands and economic needs                   in areas such as energy, environment, food, biotechnology,                      medicine, microelectronics, material resources, and other areas                 are needed.  The Summer School syllabus is specifically                         designed to help meet this urgent need.",
