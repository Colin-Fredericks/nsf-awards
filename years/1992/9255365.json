 "awd_abstract_narration": "PRISM(Partnership for Reform in Science and Math) is an                         innovative science and model designed to increase                               participation and achievement of minorities, 94% of                             which compose the Santa Ana Unified School District's                           (SAUSD) student population.  Key elements of this                               project include cooperation and collaboration between                           the school district, local postsecondary institutions,                          industry, community groups and parents.  The district-                          postsecondary institution partnership known as Project                          STEP has had a successful relationship since 1982.  This                        partnership will forge a new initiative for science and                         math curriculum reform, based on the new California                             Frameworks; staff development and leadership; student                           enrichment and support and community involvement.  PRISM                        features kindergarten through university \"pipeline\"                             strategies; career-oriented family math/science                                 activities; creative bilingual solutions such as the                            \"Padres Y Maestros Unidos\" support organization;                                effective role modeling; secondary student independent                          research with undergraduate student mentors; structured,                        product-oriented dialogues for members of the                                   partnership;  and a high profile awards program, all of                         which are woven into an experience of high quality                              science and math education for the Santa Ana student.                           The impact of PRISM will be felt not only school wide                           but district and community wide and will increase the                           number of SAUSD students in math and science career                             pathway courses, who in the future will reflect the full                        spectrum of American society in SEM professions.",
