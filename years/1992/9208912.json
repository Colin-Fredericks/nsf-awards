 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to map genes for female preference               within the t-complex.  The t-complex is found on Chromosome 17 of               the house mouse (Mus species).  The genetic variant known as \"t                 haplotype\" within this region is characterized by:1) the                        possession of recessive lethal factors producing death of                       homozygous (t/t) mice during embryonic development 2) genes that                distort the transmission of sperm such that 70-90% of the progeny               of a +/t male inherit his t-haplotype .  Additionally, previous                 work in my laboratory has indicated that t-haplotypes also carry                genes that result in +/t females having strong preferences for                  +/+ as opposed to +/t males.  The experiments in the proposed                   project are designed to 1: Systematically test females carrying                 different t-haplotypes for preference to determine whether                      differences exist among t-haplotypes in the gene(s) for                         preference 2: test females carrying partial haplotypes                          (haplotypes that carry part, but not all of the genes normally                  associated with a complete t-haplotype) for preference to map                   where, within the large (15cm) t-complex the gene(s) for female                 preference are located 3: Test wild-caught females carrying                     partial haplotypes for preference to determine whether partial                  haplotypes in wild females have been produced by recombination                  from complete haplotypes or instead, represent ancestral building               blocks from which t-haplotypes have been later assembled.",
