 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957-8                  Professor Keeling of Scripps Institution of Oceanography initiated              a high precision atmospheric CO2 measurements program at Mauna Loa,             Hawaii to study the biogeochemical carbon cycle.  This measurement              program has been continued and expanded since that time.  In the                early 1960's the data set available from this program demonstrated              conclusively that the carbon dioxide concentration in the                       atmosphere was increasing at a rate of approximately a third of one             percent per year.  This increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is               caused primarily by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Since CO2 is               a \"greenhouse gas\" it is expected that within a few decades its                 increased atmospheric concentration will lead to climatic changes.              Among the central issues of the CO2 question is the reliability of              predictions of future concentrations.  Such predictions require an              understanding of the biogeochemical carbon cycle.  Presently,                   however, there are major uncertainties about the CO2 gas exchange               processes involving the oceans and terrestrial biosphere.  The goal             of this research project is to gather the type of data which can be             used to obtain a more reliable estimate of the oceanic and                      biospheric carbon dioxide sink and source strengths.                                 In this research project emphasis will be on the measurement               of the carbon isotopic composition of CO2 in the atmosphere and                 oceans as a function of space and time.  Additionally, high                     precision measurements of dissolved carbon dioxide will be made at              key locations in surface and subsurface ocean water.  These, and                supporting chemical measurements, will be used to atmosphere by the             combustion of fossil fuels.",
