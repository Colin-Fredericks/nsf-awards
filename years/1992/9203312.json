The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support an eleven-month postdoctoral research visit             by Dr. David Tomasko to work with Dr. Neil R. Foster at the                     University of New South Wales.                                                                                                                                  Separation tools suitable for use in the food, cosmetics, and                   pharmaceutical industries can be developed using supercritical                  fluids as a basis.  The stringent toxicity and purity requirements in           these fields require highly specific designs which must be based on             exact experimental data.  Solubilities of fatty acids, triglycerides,           and their mixtures will be measured in pure and cosolvent modified              SCF's to aid the separation design for this demanding application.                                                                                              The uniqueness of this application demonstrates a novel separation              technique applicable in an area that is dominated by conventional               technology in the United States.                                                                                                                                The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a stipend for eleven months and a dependent allowance.",
