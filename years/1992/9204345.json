 "awd_abstract_narration": "For machining many difficult-to-machine materials, such as                 high silicon aluminum-silicon alloys and composites,                            polycrystalline diamond tools made by the high pressure (50 kbars)              -- high temperature (1500 C) (HP-HT) process are used.  These tools             are expensive because of the high cost of processing and finishing              and need exists for an alternate tool material.  The low pressure               chemical vapor desposition (CVD) diamond synthesis, in contrast,                is relatively simple and inexpensive, thus offering a potential for             producing diamond coated cutting tools.                                              The primary goal of this project is to develop the science                 base for strongly adherent diamond coatings on various cutting tool             materials, including, cemented carbide (coated and uncoated) and                ceramics (silicon nitride and SiAION) by the four activated CVD                 diamond synthesis techniques, namely, combustion synthesis,                     microwave CVD, hot filament CVD, and laser assisted CVD with                    emphasis on the first two.  The conditions for each of the                      activated CVD diamond coating processes will be optimized for a                 given tool material based on good metallurgical coating, its                    thickness and morphology.  These tools will be characterized by                 optical and scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.               They will be evaluated in machining different work materials with               the cutting speed and length of cut as variables.  Various surface              treatments including etching of the surface, different surface                  finishing conditions, surface interlayer coatings for the substrate             will be considered.  Tool wear mechanisms, tool life, and finish                of the work material with diamond coated tools will be compared                 with that of the uncoated tools and/or polycrystalline diamond                  tools.",
