 "awd_abstract_narration": "The learning environment for minority students in statistics                    and related courses is being improved by using appropriate                      multimedia classroom technology.  Students are more actively                    involved through increased emphasis on analyzing and solving                    problems with an ability to interact directly with the                          instructor in the learning process.  Students are encouraged to                 pool their resources around the computer, working in teams or                   cooperative learning groups to solve difficult but meaningful                   problems.  Two introductory statistics courses are                              involved.This project represents the coordinated efforts of the                 Statistics faculties in the Departments of Information Systems                  and Decision Sciences and Economics to improve the performance                  levels of  students in Statistics.  The objectives of the                       project are to:  utilize advances in technology and results of                  research to change the teaching method and improve the learning                 of statistics; facilitate and promote the use of problem                        solving to learn statistics (including related courses like                     Operations Research and Econometrics); and encourage and                        enhance the study of statistics by minorities through                           identification and reduction of barriers to success.",
