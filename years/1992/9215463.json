 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of solid modeling as an industrially viable                technology was paced by the development, in the 1970's, of theory               and algorithms for boolean operations on solids, i.e. for                       converting constructive (CSG) representations into boundary                     representations (B-reps).  Theory and algorithms for the inverse                conversion, from boundary to CSG (called BCSG), were largely                    unknown prior to the work of Shapiro and Vossler in 1989-91.  Their             cell-based methods are mathematically sound and have been                       implemented experimentally, but several important practical issues              remain open.  This research addresses those issues through the                  following goals:  (1) development of significantly better                       algorithms for cell-based BCSG conversion; (2) development of a                 publicly available implementation of BCSG, initially for a domain               of natural quadric surfaces, that is usable with one or more open               architecture (i.e. public) B-rep modeling systems; and (3)                      development of theory and techniques, using new algebraic-patch and             constructive-shell representations, to enable BCSG conversion to                accommodate freeform solids.                                                         This research will re-establish CSG as an industrially viable              representation for solids, and will enable fully symmetric dual-                representation modeling systems to be built which should be                     considerably more powerful than today's B-rep-only systems.",
