 "awd_abstract_narration": "A group of symmetries of a space X induces symmetries on                   certain algebraic invariants of X (so-called homology                           representations).  In this way, transformation group theory (the                study of the symmetries of continuous objects, such as spaces) and              representation theory (the study of symmetries of discrete or                   algebraic objects) become intimately related.  The goal of this                 project is to investigate systematically the interactions between               the geometry of symmetries (such as fixed points) and their                     algebraic manifestations.  In particular, the problem of existence              of symmetries of Moore spaces with prescribed algebraic                         representations (the Steenrod Problem, posed in the early 1960's),              algebraic surfaces, and certain 4-dimensional spaces all provide                concrete problems to which a general theory should apply.                       Techniques from topology, algebraic geometry, and representation                theory should interact fruitfully in this endeavor.                                  Symmetry plays an absolutely fundamental role in science (in               fact, in art and music as well), and we attempt to understand this              role through qualitative and certain quantitative measurements and              comparisons.  In mathematics, symmetry plays a fundamental role                 also, and it has many different but related manifestations.  To                 have a precise and logical understanding of symmetries of a                     mathematical structure, such as a space, we need to discover and                quantify its so-called invariants and other important features.  A              wide variety of sophisticated tools of this trade, chiefly                      algebraic ones, have been developed over the years in different                 research projects, and this investigator is adept at and plans to               draw upon a surprising number of them in his current work.",
