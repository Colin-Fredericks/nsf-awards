 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general objective of this research is to develop understanding              of the mechanisms operating in higher plants to regulate the                    biosynthesis of diterpenoid metabolites that contribute to a                    plant's ability to survive environmental and biological stresses.               The focus is on the regulation of cyclization enzymes that catalyze             the first committed step of the pathway leading to a                            physiologically active diterpenoid metabolite(s), and thus is a                 logical site for regulation.  One target enzyme is casbene                      synthetase, which catalyzes the synthesis of the putative                       phytoalexin, casbene, in castor bean seedlings.  The casbene                    synthetase gene is transcriptionally activated in response to                   treatment of the seedlings with pectic fragment elicitors.  Genomic             clones containing casbene synthetase coding sequences have been                 isolated.  A major goal of the research is to characterize the                  casbene synthetase gene and the cis- and trans-acting factors that              participate in the transcriptional activation of the gene in                    response to pectic fragment elicitors.  These investigations are                of importance in connection with plant disease resistance since                 phytoalexins are among the defensive components that appear in a                resistance response.  Another experimental target is kaurene                    synthetase, a key regulatory enzyme in the pathway leading to the               gibberellin family of regulators that help mediate environmental                influences on plant growth and development.  A major objective is               to purify kaurene synthetase to homogeneity, and to use the                     purified protein to prepare specific antibodies and kaurene                     synthetase cDNA probes.  These probes will be used to measure                   kaurene synthetase mRNA levels in plant tissues, and changes in                 their levels under different environmental conditions, as an                    indicator of their relative potentials for gibberellin                          biosynthesis.",
