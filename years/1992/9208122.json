 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to assemble some of the most detailed and                       complete food web data yet collected, and use these data to                     evaluate, extend, and integrate food web theory.  Data will be                  collected from several of the most thoroughly studied ecosystems                in the world including Lake Tahoe, Castle Lake, and Clear Lake in               California, and Mirror Lake in New Hampshire.  In constructing                  food webs for these lakes we will emphasize complete species                    lists (several webs will include over 500 species), even                        resolution of producers, consumers and decomposers, and estimates               of the dominance of species and strengths of trophic                            interactions.  With these data we will evaluate the effects of                  scale (extent and resolution of the data) on food web structure,                extend food web theory to more precisely account for real food                  webs (i.e., food webs with at least an order of magnitude more                  species than those in current food web collections) and integrate               food web theory by delineating the complementarily between binary               descriptions and functionally prioritized descriptions of food                  webs.  We will examine major food web patterns including                        connectance, links per species, chain length, and proportions of                top, intermediate and basal species.  The data will also be used                specifically to test several pertinent hypotheses about food web                structure including the intermediate trophic state hypothesis,                  the constant connectance hypothesis, and previously described                   effects of scale and aggregation on food web structure.  I Larger               goals of this proposal include improving procedures for                         constructing food webs and integrating food web theory by                       assembling data using both structural (binary) and functional                   approaches for the same systems.  These studies will help                       stimulate the clearly needed interaction and integration of                     theory and empiricism for development of this vital subdiscipline               of ecology.",
