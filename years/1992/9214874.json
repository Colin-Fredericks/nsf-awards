 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the development of educational                           materials for early introduction into the computer science                      curriculum of formal methods and object-oriented programming.                   Material on operational, denotational, and logical semantics                    will be developed, as well as laboratory exercises and related                  materials for teaching object-oriented programming and design.                  Colgate University plans to develop a network of computer                       science educators from a wide variety of institutions who will                  contribute to this project.  Curriculum materials will be                       disseminated through Internet, and presented at workshops, and                  at other educational and professional meetings.                                                                                                                 Colgate University plans to develop materials in object-                        oriented programming and in formal methods for introduction                     into intermediate-level computer science courses.  Work on                      object-oriented programming and design will focus on the                        development of laboratory materials for several hardware                        platforms; work on formal methods will focus on two major                       areas: program verification and operations, denotational and                    logical semantic.  The results of the curriculum and materials                  development will be disseminated through Internet, and will be                  presented at workshops, and educational and professional                        meetings.",
