 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of Code-Division Multiple-Access                   communication over fading multipath channels.  The overall                      objective of the research is to design and analyze practically                  implementable adaptive receivers for reliable,                                  bandwidth-efficient, and near-far resistant communications.  The                feasibility of the project is established via new results in                    receiver design and analysis that achieve these objectives for                  the nonselective fading, synchronous CDMA channel with memory.                  Receiver complexity is of fundamental importance in CDMA                        communication and the new idea of group detection is proposed to                address that issue.  It is shown that the adaptive receiver                     designed for the fading channel with memory far outperforms the                 conventional spread spectrum receiver.  This research will                      consider the development of schemes that will realize the                       practically achievable limits of bandwidth-efficient CDMA                       communication over general fading multipath channels.  Analytical               tools from the theories of detection, estimation, minimax                       robustness, optimal filtering, dynamic programming, digital                     filtering, large deviations and error probability bounding                      techniques for optimum sequence detection problems will be                      applied, and new analytical tools sought.",
