Adetuyi of the Federal University of Technology,                                Nigeria, in an ongoing study led by Dr. Jon Y.                                  Takemoto of Utah State University, (NSF Grant                                   DCB-9003398), of the properties and chemical structure                          of the Syringae toxin.  This collaborative component                            will expand the work to investigate an antifungal                               toxin produced by Pseudomonas syringae isolated from                            wheat seed coats.  The toxin's structure will be                                determined and its mode of action on yeasts studied.                                                                                                            The cooperation could lead to methods for controlling                           fungal deterioration of stored cereal grains.  This                             has implications for the use of wheat seeds for                                 genetic stock as well as for food uses.  The project                            is consistent with the criteria for the Science in                              Developing Countries (SDC) program in that it                                   strengthens collaboration between U.S. scientists and                           engineers and their counterparts in developing                                  countries, and increases the capacity of scientists                             and engineers in developing countries to address                                constraints to development.",
