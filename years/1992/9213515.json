Throughout the development of the field             of ecology, the Ecological Society of America promoted its status               as a scientific discipline through its journals and scientific                  meetings.  There were difficulties in focus, however, for a society             that attracted scientists with such disparate training.  Questions              arose about the proper direction and scope of ecological questions,             such as the place of environmental concerns in research.  This                  drawing of disciplinary boundaries drew distinctions between pure               and applied research.  Rachel Carson highlighted the problems of                defining boundaries by usurping the authority of the scientific                 field of ecology with her book Silent Spring.  Carson popularized               ecological concepts and urged the inclusion of ethics in science.               She was instrumental in awakening the public to the dangers of                  excessive pesticide use, yet her reception by ecologists was mixed.             Carson was never part of mainstream American ecology and yet she                affected its definition by drawing public attention to its                      practice.  Ms. Tjossem is examining the process by which Carson                 affected the whole course of the science of ecology.",
