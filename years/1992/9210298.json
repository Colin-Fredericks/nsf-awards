 "awd_abstract_narration": "In all aspects of negotiation and conflict among individuals and                among groups, there are fundamental theoretical questions                       concerning biases in human judgment and decision-making.  This                  project examines the role of social perception in the                           development, maintenance and revision of judgment error in                      interpersonal conflicts.  The first line of investigation                       examines basic social perception processes in negotiation and                   factors that may reduce biases in social perception.  These                     studies focus on whether judgment error in negotiation is                       primarily due to biases in the reception of information or faulty               communication or information exchange.  The dynamic effect of the               two processes is also explored in an investigation of behavioral                confirmation in negotiation.  This investigation examines how                   perceivers' expectancies influence their behavior toward their                  opponent and may elicit expectancy-confirming behavior from the                 opponent.  The second line of research investigates social                      categorization processes and negotiation.  These studies examine                whether negotiations with members of one's own social group are                 more or less productive than negotiations conducted with members                of an outside group.  In addition, these studies examine how the                quality of negotiated agreements conducted with out-group members               is affected by the degree to which one's performance affects the                welfare of his or her group.  These studies have important                      practical implications for enhancing the quality of interpersonal               negotiations and intergroup relations.",
