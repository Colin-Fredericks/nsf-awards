 "awd_abstract_narration": "The normal formation of the cerebral cortex is a prerequisite for               attaining higher cognitive, motor and sensory function.  This study             will examine some basic issues of cortical development:  intrinsic              and extrinsic factors regulating either differentiation of neurons              or connectivity allowing the development of functionally distinct               areas of cerebral cortex in mammals.  In particular, this proposal              will be focusing on the development of one part of the limbic                   system, the perirhinal cortex.  In recent transplantation studies,              results have shown there is an early specification of neurons to                express a limbic molecular phenotype, the limbic-system-associated              membrane protein, LAMP (Barbe and Levitt, 1991; Appendix I).                    Earlier experiments showed that this molecule may play a role in                circuit formation in vitro (Keller et al., 1989).  Most recently,               results suggested that there is a correlation between the early                 commitment of the cortex to this molecular phenotype and the                    formation of specific thalamocortical connections (Barbe and                    Levitt, submitted; Appendix II).  These experiments have led to                 additional issues for exploration of cortical commitment and                    connectivity.  Using a tissue transplantation paradigm, I will be               testing two aspects of the development of the cortex into                       functional areal arrays:  1) The commitment of cortical neurons to              a functional areal phenotype is linked to the cell cycle.  2) The               connections induced between limbic thalamic afferents and LAMP-                 positive cortical transplants are maintained permanently.                                                                                                       The long term goals of my laboratory, some of which are addressed               in this proposal, are to better understand the molecular factors                that modulate the assembly of functional neuronal circuits, both                during development and after injury of the mammalian central                    nervous system.",
