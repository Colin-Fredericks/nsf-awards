 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most higher plants reproduce sexually, consequently factors that                influence fertilization have a significant impact on reproductive               success.  Despite that little is known of the cellular and                      molecular events surrounding pollen germination, tube growth, and               deposition of the sperm into the embryo sac.  We established that               flavonoids, normally found in pollen, are essential for successful              fertilization.  Flavonoid-deficient pollen is unable to germinate               but this defect can be \"rescued\" by the exogenous application of                micromolar quantities of a specific class of flavonoids leading to              germination and tube growth in vitro and normal fertilization and               seed-set in vivo.  How do these small, hydrophobic molecules induce             pollen germination?  The basic tool to address this question if the             pollen rescue assay.  To begin, the accumulation site and                       intracellular transport mechanisms of flavonoids will be determined             by localization and kinetic analysis.  The identical flavonoid                  required for germination also stimulates transcription; this                    suggests a molecular mechanism of flavonoid action and requires                 that these genes be identified by cloning and sequencing.  This                 will lead to a model of flavonoid action during pollen germination.             The product of this proposal will extend the knowledge of basic                 reproductive biology and provide information useful in the design               of mechanisms to manipulate plant fertility.",
