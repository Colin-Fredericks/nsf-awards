 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introductory Biology is being revised to make it a more                         creative, engaging, and participatory experience for both                       potential majors and for non-majors.  The intention is to                       strengthen student interest in Biology by designing an exciting                 and more realistic new course.  The new lab format will involve                 doing real laboratory experiments and learning real research                    skills such as experimental design and data analysis.  The                      students work in small groups that use the 'PI system' and                      write group lab reports modeled on the writing of a scientific                  paper.  Students who take the revised course will have a                        clearer grasp of how laboratory science is actually done and                    will have first-hand knowledge about such key ideas as                          hypothesis creation and testing, data collection and                            interpretation, and scientific writing.  This experimental                      course is being compared with the current introductory biology                  course by a team of evaluators from other institutions.",
