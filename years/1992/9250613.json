 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Environmental Engineering department at Montana College of                  Mineral Science and Technology is developing an undergraduate                   laboratory where students acquire experience in full-scale                      projects which merge design, experimental preparation, field                    work, laboratory work, group participation, and data analysis.                  The Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6) Tracer Laboratory improves the                    students' understanding of air pollution while providing them                   with hands-on project experience.  The equipment in the SF6                     Laboratory consists of six subsystems:  a system for releasing                  SF6 gas at a controlled, metered rate; samplers for collecting                  time-integrated air samples downwind of the source; an SF6                      analyzer for continuously monitoring tracer concentrations and                  for analyzing the time-integrated air samples; a calibration                    system; a meteorological system for measuring the winds and the                 ambient temperature during field studies; and a portable data                   acquisition system for collecting and processing the                            meteorological and concentration data.  The equipment is                        intended for full-scale experimentation in areas which are                      critical to environmental engineering.  As examples, in the SF6                 Laboratory students can study the transport and diffusion of                    air contaminants, develop and apply laboratory skills in a                      field setting, study building ventilation requirements, and                     test effectiveness of existing ventilation systems.",
