This project is a                                                    renewal of support for research,                                                conducted under NSF Grant No. 89-                                               21004, in which the investigator                                                focussed on fundamental methodology                                             for modeling groundwater flow and                                               solutes that are derived from non-                                              point sources.  In this renewal                                                 project, the investigator plans on                                              improvement of the model and                                                    conducting field experiments to                                                 verify its predictive ability for                                               movement of pollutants in                                                       groundwater aquifers.                                                                                                                                           This project is expected to improve                                             our fundamental understanding of                                                the effect that regional                                                        hydrological characteristics and                                                aquifer parameters have on the rate                                             at which pollutants move in                                                     aquifers.  The investigator plans                                               on relating the dispersion                                                      parameters of the developed models                                              to easily measurable variables such                                             as the rate of aquifer recharge,                                                the hydraulic gradient,                                                         transmissivity, aquifer thickness                                               and laboratory-scale determined in                                              laboratory-scale dispersivity.
