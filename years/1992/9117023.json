 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of ten U.S. participants in           a U.S.-Japan Seminar on New Approaches to Developmental                         Endocrinology, to be held Janaury 11-15, 1993 in Honolulu.  The                 co-organizers are Professor Christopher Brown, Hawaii Institute of              Marine Biology, and Professor Akihisa Urano, Ocean Research                     Institute, University of Tokyo.  The seminar will address the state             of understanding of the involvement of hormones in the regulation               of development.  Participants will include biologists working with a            wide range of organisms:  insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds,           and mammals.                                                                                                                                                    Recent indications that signals from the endocrine system of the                developing embryo are supplemented by hormones of maternal                      origin has required some revision of prior thinking on this subject.            Researchers in the United States and Japan have figured                         importantly in this research.  The \"new approaches\" in the seminar              refer to both new concepts in the endocrinology of development                  and the application of new techniques.  The seminar will provide a              form for integrating recent findings and increasing the collaboration           among scientists in the two countries.",
