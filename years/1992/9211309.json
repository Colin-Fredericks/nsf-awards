 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research in Undergraduate Institutions award (RUI)               to study the effect of economic development on gender inequality                and women's labor for participation.  The study will focus on the               effects of four factors on gender inequality in labor force                     participation and distribution, namely the effect of prior                      sociocultural emphasis on women's roles, the effect of a                        society's level of economic development, the effect of the degree               of society's economic dependency on other countries, and the                    effect of the type of trade strategy employed by a society.  A                  longitudinal data set containing data for 92 nations is used in                 panel regression analyses to identify basic patterns and test                   hypotheses.                                                                          Most research on the relationship between women's status and               economic development is based on case studies, and the results of               these studies are often contradictory.  This study, in contrast,                will provide a systematic analysis data for many countries over a               long period of time.  This is likely to clarify many of the                     ambiguities in previous research on economic development and                    gender inequality.",
