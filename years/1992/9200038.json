 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides fund to continue a successful REU SITE at the               Department of Pharmacology, University of South Alabama.                        The focus of the undergraduate research program is cellular                     signaling, e.g., how hormones, calcium, cyclic nucleotides, protein             phosphorylation, and induction of specific intracellular proteins               may influence cell function.  Participating faculty have extramural             research support and ongoing, active research programs.                         Compensation and access to student facilities (e.g. library and                 athletic facilities, housing and meal services) will be available               for all program participants.  Students will be provided a research             experience in a laboratory selected by them on the basis of summary             descriptions and discussion with the investigators.  In addition,               students will receive a formal review of the general area of                    cellular signalling via an organized weekly course.  At the end of              the summer, students will present their findings on Student                     Research Day.  Students will be recruited from regional                         undergraduate institutions that do not themselves provide formal                research experiences for undergraduates.  Recruiting will be                    accomplished through science counselors, mail brochures and campus              visits.  This particular match of student and research experience               will encourage talented students with little knowledge of the                   opportunities available in science to apply to Ph.D. programs and               embark on careers in science and technology.",
