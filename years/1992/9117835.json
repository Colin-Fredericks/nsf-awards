 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regeneration of detached flagella by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,                 requires the coordinate induction of synthesis of a large number                of flagellar proteins.  Following induction, flagellar protein                  mRNAs are specifically destroyed in a translation-dependent manner.             This proposal addresses the mechanism and specificity of the                    regulated degradation.  Chimeric mRNAs, composed of parts of the                regulated alpha-tubulin mRNA, and an unregulated stable mRNA will               be expressed from an alpha-tubulin promotor to determine the                    sequence specificity of degradation.  An in vitro degradation                   extract, which reproduces degradation specificity observed in vivo,             will be expoited to localize and characterize the trans-acting                  factors involved in degradation.  The translation dependence of                 poly(A) metabolism and the effect of altered poly(A) metabolism on              flagellar mRNA function and stability will be investigated by                   identifying the sequences which direct the rate of poly(A) loss,                and altering those sequences.  The finding that a probable poly(A)-             binding protein (PABP) is coinduced by deflagellation suggests this             protein may be involved in regulation of the coinduced mRNAs.  The              sequence for the Chlamydomonas PABP will be isolated from a lambda-             library.  Elimination of induction of this protein will be                      attempted by coinducing an antisense version, and the effect on                 coinduced mRNA stability and translation evaluated.",
