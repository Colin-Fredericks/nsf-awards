 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop a model to analyze the               determinants of household energy conservation decisions.                        Conservation investment decisions are modeled in the presence of                energy price uncertainty, and the actual patterns of household                  investments during the 1970's and early 1980's are analyzed. The                irreversibility of energy related investments creates an option                 value in postponing investment, given the possibility that future               energy prices could fall sufficiently to make the investment                    economically unattractive.  It is quite possible that the existence             of this option value can help explain the low rate of investment in             energy conservation measures recorded during the past two decades.                                                                                              Using the model developed in the project, investment simulations                calibrated to aggregate data will be carried out to explore the                 pattern of energy conservation investment, and then to investigate              empirically the impact of tax incentives on investment behavior.                The empirical work will use a large panel data set of individual                tax returns followed over a three year period.  In addition,                    different investment patterns by energy conservation category will              be analyzed.",
