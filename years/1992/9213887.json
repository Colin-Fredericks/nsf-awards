This symposium will be presented at the 204th                   National Meeting of the American Chemical Society on August                     23-28, 1992 in Washington DC. The two and one-half day                          symposium will feature recognized experts from industrial,                      governmental and academic institutions. The invited speakers                    represent a wide range of disciplines and perspectives, as well                 as different facets of materials chemistry. The objective will                  be to educate chemists, materials scientists and policy makers                  about materials chemistry: what it is, why it is important, and                 where it is heading in the context of new science, technology                   and education.  In addition to informing the general scientific                 community about the role of chemistry in the ongoing revolution                 in materials science and technology, the symposium will serve                   to demonstrate the commonality of interest among many chemists                  in this area and will help reshape the boundaries among the                     various areas of chemistry and between chemistry and materials                  science.                                                                        %%%                                                                             Support of this symposium is wholly consistent with the                         educational, scientific and infrastructural goals of the                        Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. The forum of a                   National Meeting will both educate and focus the chemistry                      community to the importance and relevance of materials                          chemistry.",
