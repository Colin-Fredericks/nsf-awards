 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three topics in mathematical quantum theory of systems of                  many degrees of freedom will be investigated in this project.  Of               main interest are problems related to the structure and stability               of matter.                                                                           First, rigorous estimates will be established on the effects               of correlations between many electron on the binding and                        ionization in atomic and molecular systems.                                          Second, the structure of matter  on the surface of a neutron               star under large magnetic fields will be mathematically analyzed.               This study involves the fairly  new area of semiclassical                       analysis in the presence of a magnetic field.                                        Third, are problems related to the statistical mechanics of                quantum spin systems, especially the systems with continuous                    symmetry.                                                                            Quantum mechanics is probably one of the most successful                   attempts to give a mathematical description of the world around                 us.  However, while many complex quantum mechanically systems are               fairly well understood at a somewhat heuristic level, a complete                mathematical analysis of these systems is very difficult and very               often lacking.  The lack of a detailed mathematical analysis of                 these systems is not separate from a lack of complete                           understanding of the underlying physics.  The mathematical                      analysis of a series of these complex physical systems will be                  attempted and it is the hoped that new mathematical as well as                  physical insight will emerge.",
