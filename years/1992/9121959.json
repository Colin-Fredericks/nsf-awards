 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the most influential current approaches to international                relations theory appeal to analogies between the international                  system and oligopolistic markets.  However, the existing formal                 economic models of oligopoly have few counterparts in international             relations theory.  In this research the investigator develops a                 formal approach to international relations theory by beginning to               formalize this analogy.                                                                                                                                         Preliminary research by the investigator has already developed a                natural model of a bipolar international system; established                    conditions sufficient to ensure the existence of a peaceful                     equilibrium in which neither state attacks; shown that there is a               strictly Pareto dominant pair of peaceful equilibrium payoffs; and              characterized the unique pure-stragey, peaceful, Markov perfect                 equilibrium that yields these payoffs.  In the model, increases in              the cost of fighting, a state's level of risk aversion, a state's               discount factor, and the advantages of striking first are shown to              increase the equilibrium level of armaments in the system.  More                generally, the model provides a framework for analyzing broader                 issues in international relations theory including the role of                  anarchy and the problem of absolute and relative gains.  The                    current research extends this model in an effort to incorporate                 incomplete information, link the model with existing formal work                on crisis bargaining, and broaden the scope of the analysis to                  encompass several issues in international political economy.",
