The investigator plans on using                           ultrasonic radiation that is below the cavitation                               threshold of the fluid in contact with the solid surfaces.                      The investigator's research plan includes steps to                              separate the effects of abrasion, temperature and                               ultrasonic vibrations.                                                                                                                                          Results of this project are expected to identify the                            nature of the chemical alteration and possible degradation                      when organic contaminants of soil and water are exposed to                      high intensity ultrasonic radiation.  This research is                          expected to provide knowledge as to potential                                   applicability of a process using ultrasonic energy for                          decontamination of soil and adsorbents used in treatment                        of water and assist in characterizing the process for                           potential use in engineering design of decontamination                          systems.",
