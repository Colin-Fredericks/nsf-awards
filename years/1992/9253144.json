 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past eleven years, the APS in collaboration with the               APS Committee for Minority in Physic has operated the APS Corporate             Sponsored Scholarships for Minority Undergraduate Students who                  major in Physics.  The scholarship program provide financial                    support, a mentorship program consisting of practicing professional             physicists and corporate sponsorship.  Over 100 undergraduate                   students have participated in the program which started in 1980.                As a result, among the scholarship recipients there is a wide                   spectrum of students at different levels as well as varied career               paths and achievements.  The APS has annually updated the records               of the student and thus is in excellent position to analyze the                 results and make suggestions for improvements.  In spite of many                efforts, the number of minority students who chose careers as                   professional physicist and other scientists is well below their                 percentage in the population.  The APS scholarships program has                 obtained useful information on a rather significant portion of the              minority pipeline problem by following minority students from                   highschool,  to undergraduate school, to graduate school, to                    postdoctoral position and then on to employment.  Thus, significant             data can be developed, which can address the various decision                   making points at different stages in the pipeline.                                                                                                                  We proposed to hold a workshop consisting of past and present               APS Corporate Scholarship winners, their mentors, corporate                     sponsors and appropriate members of the professional societies and              government.  The workshop will focus on the:                                                                                                                    1. Identification and analysis of the crucial steps made be the                 student scholarship winners in deciding to go on to careers in                  physics or a related science,                                                                                                                                   2.  Identification and analysis of the crucial decision points                  which resulted in some scholarship winners deciding not to major in             science but in another field,                                                                                                                                   3.  Identification and analysis of the variables leading to a                   scholarship recipient not completing his or her college education,                                                                                              4. Analysis of the role of the mentor program and how it effects                career choices,                                                                                                                                                 5.  Determination of strategies on how to involve the scholarship               winners and professional physicists (many from minority groups) in              accessing existing networks, and developing their own networking                system with assistance from the professional societies and other                programs concerned with minorities.                                                                                                                             It is expected that information and results garnered form this                  workshop, focused on the APS program, will be applicable to other               efforts aimed at increasing the number of minority students in all              the sciences.",
