 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this project is to synthesize by a newly                 divised method a sufficient quantity of 2-azido \u013132p! palmitoyl CoA             for photolabeling specific mitochondrial membrane proteins, namely              the ADP/ATP carrier from beef heart mitochondria and the uncoupling             protein from brown fat mitochondria.  Following purification and                cleavage of the photolabeled proteins, the radioactive peptide                  amino acids will be sequenced to mp the acyl CoA and possibly the               nucleotide binding sites.  The ADP/ATP carrier will be photolabeled             from both the cytosolic and matrix sides of the inner mitochondrial             membrane with the aim of differentiating between a single or two                distinct binding sites.  The amino acid profiles of the acyl CoA                binding sites on the ADP/ATP carrier and uncoupling protein will be             compared for the degree of homology of these two similar proteins.              Long chain acyl CoA esters are recognized to be biological                      regulatory ligands for a number of important enzymes.  These                    experiments will provide for the first time pertinent biochemical               information on the mechanism of regulation of cellular                          bioenergetics by acyl CoA esters.  Furthermore, it is anticipated               that 2-azido palmitoyl CoA will prove very useful in screening for              the co-valent binding of a number of membrane and soluble proteins              which are modulated by acyl CoA esters.",
