 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the design and testing of a system                  for improving time dissemination on computer networks.  The                     system consists of two parts: 1) servers whose clocks are                       calibrated using dial-up telephone links to the NIST primary time               scale, and 2) clients who request calibration data from                         the servers via either a local- or wide-area network.  The                      servers and clients construct models of the performance of the                  local clock and the calibration channel, and use these models to                adjust the local time and the interval between calibrations to                  maintain a specified accuracy.  The Internet is being used to                   compare the performance of the method with other systems.                            The method is simpler and potentially more accurate than the               existing Network TIme Protocol because:  1) there can be many                   more primary servers since they require no special hardware.  The               network distance between any client and a primary server                        therefore can be quite short.  2) The channel between NIST and                  each primary server is easier to characterize because it is                     stable and reciprocal to a high degree.  The result is either                   less frequent calibrations for the same level of accuracy or                    improved performance at the same calibration interval.",
