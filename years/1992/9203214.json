 "awd_abstract_narration": "The remarkable floristic similarities between temperate                    eastern Asia and eastern North America have been recognized for                 over a century.  Despite an unusually healthy fossil record, we                 are far from a general biogeographic hypothesis that will prove                 to be robust across many distinct taxa.  The most informative                   approach to this problem will combine estimates of genetic                      divergence, preferably for several different data sets, with                    explicit methods of cladistic and biogeographic analysis.  Such                 an approach is described herein for the woody genus Gleditsia                   (Leguminosae: Caesalpinioideae), which contains two hypothesized                eastern Asian-eastern North American vicariad species-pairs, in                 addition to other intra- and intercontinental disjunctions.  The                study will first use cladistic analysis of different molecular                  data sets to recognize putative monophyletic groups.  Area                      cladograms will be constructed to discern intra- and                            intercontinental disjunctions within monophyletic groups.  Tests                of competing biogeographic hypotheses (especially dispersal vs.                 vicariance) for the origin of eastern Asian-eastern North                       American disjunctions (and others) will derive from the topology                of area cladograms coupled with estimates of genetic divergence                 provided by the molecular data.  Gleditsia will thus serve as a                 model for similar approaches in other genera, with the ultimate                 objective being to understand the origins and biogeographic                     history of other northern hemisphere Tertiary disjunctions.",
