 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the ocean is                an order of magnitude larger than the particulate organic carbon                (POC) pool, and twice as large as the atmospheric pool of CO2,                  yet as much as 90% of DOC remains uncharacterized as to specific                chemical identity.  One component of this uncharacterized pool is               known as \"humic substance\" or \"gelbstoff\", two non-specific terms               for a complex mixture of compounds having a yellow color and a                  blue fluorescence.  The way in which these compounds have been                  defined and analyzed in the past has resulted in much confusion                 and a lack of insight regarding their nature, distribution, and                 cycling in the ocean.  Recent developments in fluorescent                       spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography show                    promising results when applied to the study of gelbstoff in                     seawater.  Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM)                   analysis of unconcentrated samples has shown for the first time                 the existence of four different fluorophores in seawater, each of               which exhibits characteristic properties and distributions.  One                of these fluorophores may be indicative of a protein-like,                      bioreactive substance.  Ion-pairing HPLC can resolve gelbstoff                  into up to twenty individual components.  Application of these                  new technologies in tandem to the analysis of dissolved organic                 matter in seawater can be used to trace different components of                 the DOC, thereby leading to an improved understanding of the                    oceanic carbon cycle.",
