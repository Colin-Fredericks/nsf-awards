Considerable analytical and                                                     experimental works have been carried                                            out in active control of civil                                                  engineering structures under                                                    environmental loads over the past 20                                            years, and now the progress is such                                             that large-scale implementation is                                              feasible.  Full-scale prototype                                                 systems have been built and tested                                              in Japan in recent years, but no                                                full-scale research and state-of-                                               the-art system of this important new                                            technology in the U.S. has been                                                 developed to date.                                                                                                                                              The proposed system comprises a 150-                                            foot high tower research structure                                              to be assembled at the National                                                 Inventor's Hall of Fame in Akron,                                               Ohio.  The tower will be capable of                                             dynamic excitations by (i) simulated                                            earthquakes, (ii) natural winds, and                                            (iii) other types of motions by                                                 mechanical means.  The design will                                              be flexible, permitting the dynamic                                             properties and control configuration                                            of the tower to be varied for                                                   research use, and will incorporate                                              features to enable state-of-the-art                                             active control techniques to be                                                 developed and tested.  The project                                              will be carried out by a                                                        collaborative industrial and                                                    academic based research team.",
