 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues collaborative research on                           mathematical questions concerning multiple trigonometric series.                The starting point of the work rests with the 1870 result of G.                 Cantor who showed that at most one trigonometric series can                     converge to a given function.  This is a different question from                that of determining whether a given series converges.  It falls                 into the category of what is known as a uniqueness question.  A                 longstanding problem has been the uniqueness question for                       multiple trigonometric series.  There are many more obstacles to                this question arising from the multiple methods of summation                    available, which do not show up in the one variable case.  The                  investigators have determined that the uniqueness is valid in the               case of rectangular summation.  Work will now be done in carrying               over newly developed techniques to investigate other summation                  methods such as iterated or spherical convergence.  In addition,                further studies will be carried out on questions of multiple                    uniqueness and the problem of determining when a trigonometric                  series (in several variables) is a Fourier series.                                   Trigonometric series form the backbone of the modern theory                of harmonic analysis.  They play a ubiquitous role in the study                 of analytic problems ranging from pure number theory to the                     solution of partial differential equations of physics.  Recent                  results on the uniqueness question has opened up a new avenue of                research possibilities which have essentially been dormant for                  decades.",
