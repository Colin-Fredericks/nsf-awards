 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research combining                     general operator-theoretic functional analysis with differential                equations.  Three overlapping areas will be treated in the work.                The first concerns nonlinear partial differential equations of                  evolution which are of mixed type in the space variable.  Initial               work will focus on a concrete example, the Kompaneetz Equation of               plasma physics.  It can be written as an abstract Cauchy problem.               The first task is to determine properties of the resolvent; in                  particular whether or not it has a dense range.  The second area                involves semigroups of operators, particularly those whose                      infinitesimal generators split into a linear and locally smooth                 nonlinear part.  The object is to determine conditions for a                    globally defined semigroup of operators determining the solution                for all time and to bound the difference of any two solutions as                a function of time and the initial function norms. Finally, work                will be done on spin polarization Thomas-Fermi theory involving a               minimizing problem for pairs of functions.  One main obstacle to                finding extrema is the functional involving the two unknowns is                 not convex.  By topological arguments, one can show that extrema                exist.  The next step will be to find a method which will produce               the minima in a concrete fashion.                                                    The project combines abstract mathematical concepts with                   models of various phenomena in the physical world.  Among the                   goals of the research is one of fitting models into the proper                  generalized structures and apply the existing theory.  In this                  way one gains insight into the models and, at times, discovers                  hidden properties.",
