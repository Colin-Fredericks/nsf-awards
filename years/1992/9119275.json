 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major challenges facing molecular geneticists and                    developmental biologists is understanding the mechanisms which                  control tissue specific gene expression in higher animals.  During              the past few years, there has been extensive progress in this                   direction.  A variety of novel in vivo and in vitro systems have                been developed, a number of transcription factors involved in cell-             type specific gene expression were identified and the genes                     encoding such factors were isolated.  The hormonal and                          developmental mechanisms controlling the activity of these                      regulatory genes are subject to extensive investigation.  This                  proposal requests funds to finance a summer FASEB conference on the             topic of Transcription Regulation:  Differentiation, Development,               and Disease.  This meeting will congregate researchers actively                 engaged in studying various aspects of tissue specific gene                     expression.  In addition to discussing the basic mechanism of gene              regulation, special emphasis will be placed on discussion of both               normal and aberrant gene regulation in the following organ systems:             liver and pancreas, muscle, blood and the nervous system.  We will              also have special sessions dealing with the regulation of                       development and embryogenesis.  The emphasis will be on gene                    regulation in vertebrates and expecially in mammals.                            %%%                                                                             The conference will be held at Copper Mountain, Colorado from June              14-19, 1992.  The meeting is designed to have formal slide                      presentations, informal poster sessions, a workshop, periods of                 group discussions, and plenty of opportunity for individual                     interaction.  The conference will summarize the current                         understandings of tissue specific gene expression and should lead               to dissemination of new information, concepts, and methodologies.",
