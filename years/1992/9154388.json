 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of economic sanctions as instruments of foreign policy is               a time honored practice.  However, as the continuing debate about               the use of sanctions by the United States against nations such as               South Africa and Iraq demonstrates, there is little agreement about             the effectiveness of sanctions.  In some places at some times                   sanctions appear to have produced desirable results; in other                   places and other times they have not.  Previous research on the                 topic is inconclusive, in part because none of the existing studies             has undertaken systematic and rigorous assessments of the use of                sanctions in different contexts and under varying conditions.                                                                                                   This very promising Minority Research Initiation planning grant                 will support preliminary research on the conditions under which                 economic sanctions are likely to be more or less effective.  The                planning grant will support an exhaustive review of the literature,             a survey of extant data sources, and development of a systematic                research design for conducting further research on this important               topic.                                                                                                                                                          When completed this project should provide the basic for launching              a systematic and rigorous study of the efficacy of economic                     sanctions as instruments of foreign policy. //",
