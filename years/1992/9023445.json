 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. Dawn Iacobucci under                    the National Science Foundation's Faculty Awards for Women                      Scientists and Engineers Program.  The objectives of this                       program are to recognize the nation's most outstanding and                      promising women scientists and engineers in academic careers                    in research and teaching, to retain them in academia, and to                    facilitate the further development of their careers.                                                                                                                 This award will allow the investigator to pursue her                       research spanning the areas of statistical modeling and the                     use of such models to social network applications in                            marketing.  She will extend her modeling work by applying it                    to comparisons between pairs of people or between groups.                       For example, she plans to develop a means of identifying a                      firm's competitors in the marketplace using data and models                     of social network ties between organizations.  She also plans                   to investigate the effects of differing amounts of                              information on the actions of an intermediary agent in a                        negotiation, such as a real estate agent assisting a home                       buyer and seller.  She will also investigate the use of                         computer simulations and human laboratory experiments in                        conjunction to better understand two-person interaction                         processes.",
