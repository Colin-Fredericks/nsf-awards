 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve mathematics instruction                  for preservice and inservice mathematics teachers by utilizing                  a networked computer laboratory.  By focusing on teaching                       mathematical content using interactive computer technology, the                 project is preparing teachers to effectively teach mathematical                 concepts using technology as they enter the classrooms of the                   future.  Interactive computer technology provides a powerful                    way to depart from the traditional lecture mode and challenges                  students to work cooperatively and individually to develop                      mathematical concepts, to make generalizations, and to solve                    problems.  The computer is helping students develop the ideas                   of geometry, algebra, probability, and statistics inductively                   as they are led to generalize concepts and solve problems                       efficiently.  By coupling interactive computer technology with                  cooperative learning in this project, they are enhancing the                    mathematics learning of elementary and secondary mathematics                    students and the students they teach in the future.",
