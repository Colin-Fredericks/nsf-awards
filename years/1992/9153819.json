 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Harold Slavkin is a research scientist at the University                    of Southern California, and an active participant in efforts                    to improve pre-college science teaching in the Los Angeles                      Unified School District (LAUSD).  Dr. Slavkin has organized                     Project PRAXIS, a 24-school effort to develop and implement                     an exemplary hands-on inquiry-based elementary school                           science curriculum.  These schools are located in central                       and eastern Los Angeles, in regions of high minority                            populations with little previous emphasis on science                            teaching.  Teachers and school administrators will work with                    university scientists and science educators to develop                          school-based instructional programs.  Teachers and                              administrators will be trained in the use of instructional                      science kits, which will be managed and refurbished at LAUSD                    regional Science Centers.                                                                                                                                       Project PRAXIS will create 24 centers of exemplary science                      teaching, from which other Los Angeles schools will draw                        expertise and guidance.  The students in the 24                                 participating schools will be immersed in direct and                            relevant science activities that will develop their                             abilities to inquire and investigate independently. Their                       success will promote more widespread adoption of this                           approach, giving this project the potential for wide-ranging                    impact in this large school district.                                                                                                                           The Los Angeles Unified School District and the University                      of Southern California are providing cost sharing during the                    project's three years that amounts to 104% of NSF's                             contribution.",
