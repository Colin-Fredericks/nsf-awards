 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will provide a library of strained flamelet                        structures for hydrogen-air turbulent combustion modeling.                      Spontaneous Raman scattering will be used to obtain                             temperature and major species concentration profiles in                         opposed-jet hydrogen-air counterflow diffusion flames at                        varying fuel dilutions and strain rates.  The strain rate will                  be determined from axial velocity profiles using laser                          velocimetry.  Laser-induced fluorescence will be used to                        obtain the OH concentration profile which can be related to                     the extent of local chemical reaction.  Flames with strain                      rates up to extinction will be examined, as will flames with                    varying amounts of nitrogen diluent added to the fuel.  The                     effects of finite-rate chemistry, preferential diffusion,                       Lewis Number, and strain rate on opposed jet flames can be                      discerned from these experimentally measured flame structures.                                                                                                  An important modeling effort directed toward the                                characterization of turbulent combustion is the laminar                         diffusion flamelet theory, which models turbulent diffusion                     flames as ensembles of strained laminar diffusion flamelets.                    This type of combustion model can be used to predict                            temperature profiles, pollutant production, and liftoff                         characteristics of turbulent flames, but the laminar flamelet                   data that are utilized by the model must correctly represent                    the various fluid dynamical, diffusional, and kinetic effects                   present.  This laminar flamelet information can be in the form                  of \"libraries\" of diffusion flamelet structures of the type to                  be developed in this program.  Once the laminar diffusion                       flamelet library correctly treats the effects listed above, it                  can be used to more successfully model turbulent hydrogen-air                   combustion, including the high speed combustion in Scramjet                     engines.",
