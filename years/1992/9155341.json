 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students learn scientific concepts and acquire science                          process skills in different sequences and at different                          rates. Highly effective teaching requires an awareness of                       where a child is in the process of concept and skill                            development. Dr. Ted Chittenden of the Educational Testing                      Service proposes an effort that combines research with                          teacher enhancement. Dr. Chittenden and a cadre of                              experienced kindergarten and primary school teachers will                       research two important questions: 1) Can systematic                             documentation of student speech, writing, and artwork add                       significantly to teacher effectiveness in science teaching?                     2) What training, materials, and institutional supports are                     needed to realize this added effectiveness?  In-class                           research by the teachers and project leaders will lead to                       the development of prototypical protocols and materials for                     training teachers to use documentation in their teaching                        practices.  The Educational Testing Service will develop                        these prototypes into marketable tools for teacher                              enhancement to be disseminated in partnership with a                            publisher.                                                                                                                                                      The proposed research has the potential to establish an                         important new tool for science teaching in early childhood                      classrooms.  The teacher enhancement materials that will                        emerge from this research could have wide impact on teachers                    and schools.                                                                                                                                                    This project is supported jointly by the Teacher Enhancement                    Program and the Research in Teaching and Learning Program.                      The Educational Testing Service is cost sharing on this                         project by underwriting the costs of developing the                             prototype materials into marketable products.",
