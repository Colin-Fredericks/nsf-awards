 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of                    Pennsylvania supports a broad, interdisciplinary program of                     materials research which is currently organized into                            four primary thrust areas.                                                                                                                                      Research on reduced dimensionality and structure in macromolecular              systems addresses the design, synthesis and structural                          characterization of materials created from one- and                             two-dimensional structures, with emphasis on macromolecular                     materials with properties that cannot be realized in traditional                crystalline or polymeric materials.  The thrust on structure and                micromechanics of interfaces is investigating the characteristics               of interfaces controlling the deformation, fracture, and fatigue                behavior of multiphase materials. The research is focussed on high              temperature metallic alloys and composites, and the approach ranges             from studies of atomic and electronic structure to continuum                    mechanics. Research in the surfaces and interfaces thrust aims at               atomic and molecular level understanding of surfaces and novel                  interfacial structures, and their influence on chemical reaction                dynamics.  In the advanced polymers thrust, investigators seek to               achieve the design and synthesis of new families of organic,                    inorganic and hybrid polymers of technological importance and to                understand their behavior.                                                                                                                                      The University of Pennsylvania MRL also supports focussed research              initiatives to respond to special opportunities in materials                    research through a multidisciplinary team approach; two initiatives             currently supported address fullerenes and materials simulation,                respectively.  The MRL also operates and maintains major central                facilities for materials research.  It provides seed funds for                  exploratory research, supports programs in education and human                  resources in the materials field, and supports a range of programs              involving knowledge transfer and outreach to industry and other                 sectors.  The MRL currently supports the activities of about 39                 faculty members, 8 postdoctoral research associates, 52 graduate                students, 22 undergraduates and 9 technical and scientific staff                members.  The MRL central facilities also support a substantial                 amount of research that is funded primarily from other sources.                 The University of Pennsylvania MRL is directed by Professor E. Ward             Plummer.",
