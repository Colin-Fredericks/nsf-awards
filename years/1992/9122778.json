 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the early 1980s, research on industrial organization                 has identified a new form of flexibly specialized production in                 which large vertically integrated firms engaged in mass                         production are being superseded by agglomerations of spatially                  dense networks of small vertically disintegrated firms.                         Empirical support for this thesis comes primarily from case                     studies of single industries or isolated regions.  Very little is               know about how movement toward vertically disintegrated                         industrial structures affects spatial agglomeration and                         industrial competitiveness at the national or subregional level.                This project will test certain hypotheses relating spatial                      agglomeration, industrial organization, firm size, and industrial               competitiveness with unique data sets for industries at the                     national level, and it should provide systematic statistical                    tests of key points of contention in the debate over flexibility                in industrial structures.  The project will map spatial patterns                of agglomeration and vertical integration for selected                          industries, and it will compare agglomeration and vertical                      integration across regions by means of statistical tests of                     regression and analysis of variance.                                                 This research will add new knowledge about the geography of                industrial organization in the U.S., and it will test some                      critical hypotheses about how changes in industrial structure                   affect changes in competitiveness at regional and national                      scales.  It should further contribute to the debate about the                   impact of industrial restructuring on the agglomeration of                      leading edge industries in this country.  At a theoretical level,               the project will help settle some important questions about the                 tendency toward flexibly specialized production systems and their               spatial concentration.",
