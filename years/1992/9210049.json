 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of structurally fault-tolerant (FT) multiprocessors,                 which can reconfigure around fault components to preserve                       interconnection structure, is an important problem in computer                  architecture.  While a number of design methods have been proposed              previously, they suffer from a lack of generality, and also fail                to address practical issues like low redundancy, efficient                      reconfigurability and design scalability.  In this project we are               primarily concerned with implementing a software package based on               the node-covering and automorphic methods for designing and                     simulating fault-tolerant systems, extending both design methods                to deal with link and switch failures, devising techniques for very             fast and distributed reconfiguration, developing principles for                 more efficient realizations of our designs, and designing systems               with high average-case fault tolerance (and thus a high                         reliability-to-cost-ratio).  We also investigate how the node-                  covering formulation can be applied to incorporate fault tolerance              in uniprocessors, and in various types of logic circuits,                       especially those that can be realized as iterative arrays of                    simpler cells",
