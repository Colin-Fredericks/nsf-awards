 "awd_abstract_narration": "Five undergraduate courses, which require the knowledge of                      single- or multi-phase (involving solid-liquid or gas-liquid)                   flow in an open duct or a pipe, are taught at the department of                 Geology and Geological Engineering of the South Dakota School                   of Mines and Technology (SDSM&T).  At present, these courses                    are taught with theoretical interpretation and abstract                         visualization of the flow process.  This project provides a                     single- and multi-phase flow loop for the departmental                          undergraduate laboratory that will be used by all five courses.                 The flow loop will be used for the following applications:  (1)                 single phase flow experiments with Newtonian and Non-Newtonian                  fluids; (2) pressure drop experiments for horizontal well                       drilling; (3) pressure drop experiments for gas-oil flow                        through horizontal wells and production pipelines; (4) flow                     visualization and quantitative analysis under slurry flow                       conditions; and (5) flow visualization and quantitative                         analysis of fluvial deposition.  The flow loop will also be                     used for undergraduate design and research projects.  The                       experimental setup will be fully used throughout the summer for                 conducting undergraduate research.  Moreover, plans are                         underway to hold workshops for training regional high school                    science teachers.  This will generate interest in petroleum and                 geological engineering topics through indirect impact on high                   school students.",
