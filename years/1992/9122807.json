 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the continued support for the semi-annual                     meetings of the Universities Research Conference.  The purpose of               this conference is to bring together economists from across the                 U.S. for two days of discussion on a specific topic of current                  interest.  Conference topics are chosen for their relevance to                  current economic policy discussions as well as their interest to                academic economists.  Recent conferences have focused on monetary               policy, trade policy, government spending programs, asset                       pricing, exchange rate regimes, fiscal policy, and the economics                of the environment.  The next conference scheduled for this                     spring will focus on the international comparisons of labor                     markets.  Papers for presentation are solicited from over 70                    economics departments and 50 business schools.  Conference                      organizers are careful to select a mix of established and less                  well known researchers.  Discussants and other participants are                 also chosen to encourage interaction among economists with                      similar interests at different universities.  A typical                         conference includes 7 to 10 papers and about 80 participants from               40 different universities.",
