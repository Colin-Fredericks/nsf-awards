The researchers' primary                                        objective is to investigate and develop new                                     polymers.  The type of polymeric materials that                                 they will study are important for biomedical                                    materials in traumatology, surgery  and                                         pharmacology.  Biodegradable plastics are                                       expected to become increasingly important as                                    one solution to the growing problem of the                                      waste disposal of plastics.                                                                                                                                     This project in polymer chemistry fulfills the                                  program objectives of advancing scientific                                      knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                    U.S. and Poland to combine complementary                                        efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                                     mutual interest and competence on the basis of                                  equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of                                         benefit.",
