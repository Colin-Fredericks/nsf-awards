 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this study is the revision of the fifteen species              currently referred to Lennea, Hybosema, Gliricidia, and                         Yucaratonia.  This will stabilize the generic classification of                 this portion of the tribe Robinieae and better estimate the                     phylogenetic position of these species within it.  These species                form a distinctive element of the dry tropical forests in North                 America; however, two species occur in tropical rain forest and one             occurs in South America.  Economic uses of these species are many               and include construction materials from the wood, livestock fodder              from the copious leaf production, and \"living\" fences around                    agricultural fields and private dwellings.  The culmination of this             study will be a monograph summarizing the classification,                       phylogeny, geographic distribution, and economic value of each                  species.  An analysis of taxonomically informative restriction site             mutations from the chloroplast genome will be combined with                     classical taxonomic methods.  Further assessing the phylogenetic                position of these species in the tribe Robinieae is important                   because an increased understanding of the phylogenetic                          relationships within Robinieae will have a bearing on our knowledge             of the origins and biogeography of the North American tropical                  flora.  Robinieae is one of the largest papilionoid tribes well                 represented in tropical and subtropical North America.  Current                 evidence suggests it may have been derived from Asiatic ancestors               during the Paleocene or Eocene rather than from South American                  ancestors in more recent times.  Such phylogenetic studies of other             plant groups centered in the North American tropics will be                     essential for understanding the origins of this biota.",
