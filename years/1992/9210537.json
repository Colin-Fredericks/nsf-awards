 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for a study to compare the mechanism of action              of mammalian ribonucleotide reductase with its bacterial                        counterpart.  The subunits of the enzyme will be produced using                 plasmids available in the laboratory where Dr. Hicks will be                    spending a sabbatical year.  This will be one of the first                      opportunities to obtain an abundant amount of the mammalian enzyme              and compare its properties to the bacterial one. The tyrosyl                    radical-dinuclear iron cluster of the mammalian enzyme will be                  studied by stopped-flow absorption spectroscopy.  Studies of the                mechanism of action of this enzyme will be done using substrate                 analogs and mechanism-based inhibitors.  The mammalian enzyme has               been reported to be much less stable than the bacterial one; this               study should give new information about dinuclear non-heme iron                 clusters in this type of enzyme.                                                %%%                                                                             The components of DNA, the genetic material, are produced by a                  protein called ribonucleotide reductase.  This protein contains                 iron atoms which are non-covalently linked to the amino acid                    tyrosine.  Most iron in proteins is present as part of hemoproteins             such as hemoglobin, in blood, or myoglobin, in muscle.                          Ribonucleotide reductase does not have this type of iron-protein                linkage.  The investigator plans to compare the properties of the               protein isolated from mouse with the much more well-characterized               protein from a bacterium.  She will use several biophysical                     techniques to determine this.",
