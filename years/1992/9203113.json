 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will test three specific hypotheses that may                 account for the maintenance of non-functional anther and pollen                 production in functionally female plants of Thalictrum polygamum,               a native perennial plant with a cryptically dioecious breeding                  system.  Anther and pollen production may remain in females as a                reward for insect pollinators because of selection pressure for                 increased insect visitation (Adaptation Hypothesis); as a                       correlated response because of selection maintaining anther and                 pollen production in males (i.e. a strong, positive genetic                     correlation exists between anther and pollen production in males                and females, Genetic Constraint Hypothesis); or as vestiges of                  the ancestral cosexual state because there is little or no                      selective benefit to their removal (i.e. no \"cost\" to females for               production of anthers and pollen, Ancestry Hypothesis).                              The second portion of this project will evaluate the                       evolutionary pathway by which dioecy has evolved in the T.                      polygamun, the possible role of resource reallocation as a                      selective force important to this transition, and the relevance                 of wind pollination to the change.",
