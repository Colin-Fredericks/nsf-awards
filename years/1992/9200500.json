 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Award at the             University of Southern Mississippi.  The funds provide support for              ten undergraduate students selected from candidates who have                    completed three years from colleges in the Southeastern United                  States as well as Indiana, Illinois, Texas, Washington, and                     Wisconsin.  Participation includes a summer session and the                     following academic year.  Special emphasis is placed upon                       recruitment from under-represented groups such as females and                   minorities.  Students having three years in the physical sciences               are considered.  Scholastic achievement is the primary requirement              for participation in the program, with consideration given for                  prior research experience, and recommendation by a faculty member.              Scholastic courses on polymer science and laboratory safety are                 required during a ten week summer session.  The research under                  supervision of faculty members will involve topics in the areas of              ionomer coatings and composite membranes, crystallization kinetics              of semicrystalline ionomers, nylon copolymers, graft polymers, and              polyelectrolyte/surfactant coacervates, and bioabsorable composite              materials.  The professors involved in this program have a strong               record of interaction with undergraduate students in research.",
