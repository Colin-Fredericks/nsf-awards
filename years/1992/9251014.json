 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project relies on computers and molecular biology                          equipment to reorganize and modernize a large (1300                             students/year) entry level Principles of Biology laboratory                     which serves students in the biology program and several                        biomedical and health science programs.  The number of biology                  experiments/semester are 50% less than in the past in order to                  encourage students to pose problems, plan experiments, and                      analyze and present their quantitative results for student peer                 review.  Laboratory experiments feature comparison of student                   generated data with that derived from computer simulations.                     Equipment includes Spectronic 20 spectrophotometers (1/student                  pair), Macintosh LC computers (1/student pair), and                             electrophoresis equipment (1/4 students).  Video equipment                      (1/classroom) is used: 1) by students to review senior faculty                  prepared introductions to laboratory exercises, 2) for training                 of graduate teaching assistants, 3) by the visually and hearing                 impaired as an adjunct to classroom materials, and 4) for in-                   class supplementary demonstrations.",
