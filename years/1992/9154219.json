 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Political Science Department of The Ohio State University                   in conjunction with the American Political Science Association                  is conducting a three-week summer (1992) workshop on the                        teaching and research applications of statistical data                          analysis. The general objective is to enhance the instruction                   of undergraduates in the research practices of political                        scientists with access to a large variety of individual and                     aggregate, citizen and leader data on political and related                     phenomena.  This includes data on a number of democratic                        nations, international relations, elections of members of state                 legislators, voting in the U.S. Congress, presidential                          elections, and the U.S. Supreme Court. One of the hallmarks of                  political science research has been a growing attention to                      systematic observation across time.  In addition to using a                     variety of statistical techniques, from bi-variate cross-                       tabulations to multi-variate analysis, experimentation with the                 comparative advantages of data analysis, using programs on                      large mainframe computers, as opposed to programs designed for                  microcomputer processing, will be conducted.",
