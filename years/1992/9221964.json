 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is designed to illuminate the psycholinguistic                processes involved in implementing long-distance dependencies                   during language production.  Such dependencies constitute a                     considerable theoretical challenge, since the abstract structural               knowledge required to reliably format the discontinuous elements                does not straightforwardly mesh with the articulatory requirement               of incremental, word-by-word production.  The dependencies to be                explored are, primarily, number agreement between subjects and                  verbs, and, secondarily, number agreement between subjects and                  subject anaphors.  Because verb agreement in English may call on                a range of information about number from the nonlinguistic                      message, from the lexicon, from the morphology, and from other                  sources, it offers many opportunities to examine the transmission               and interaction of information during language production.                      Conversely, because it exhibits strict syntactic conditioning ,                 it offers opportunities to observe constraints on the                           transmission and interaction of information.  Predictions about                 the nature of information transmission and the types of                         constraints likely to operate are derived from an approach to                   production developed by Garrett (1975, 1988) and elaborated by                  others (Bock, 1987a; Lapointe, 1985; Lapointe and Dell, 1989;                   Levelt, 1989).  The experiments employ agreement-error                          elicitation tasks inn tandem with time pronunciation tasks to                   explore the nature of the number information used in the                        agreement operation, the nature of subject identification and                   maintenance operations, and the processing demands of agreement                 implementation.",
