 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study addresses two aspects of the mechanism of carbon                     oxidation reactions:  the role of surface diffusion and the                     nature of the \"strong sites\" on carbon.  Diffusion of oxygen                    across the surface is studied using an argon-flush experiment                   in which the continued growth after reaction of monolayer etch                  pits on the basal plane of graphite is measured in an inert                     atmosphere.  The second topic is investigated with high-                        temperature (1000-1500\u001aC) temperature-programmed desorption of                  surface oxygen complexes; exploratory experiments show                          significant amounts of carbon monoxide desorb in this range.                    In addition, monolayer channeling and monolayer edge recession                  studies will be extended to carbon/carbon dioxide and                           carbon/water reactions catalyzed by alkali and alkaline earth                   catalysts; experimental techniques include gold-decoration                      transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,                   and spectroscopic analysis.                                                                                                                                     Oxidation of carbon is one of the most important processes                      underlying civilization and is also one of the least                            understood.  It is a classical fundamental problem involving                    gas-solid kinetics, catalysis, diffusion, morphology, and heat                  transfer.  It is also of practical importance for combustion,                   synthetic fuels, and particulate control.",
