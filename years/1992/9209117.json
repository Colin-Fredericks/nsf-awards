This effort              would be applied to areas relevant to NREN that include (but not                limited to) defac to and official standards and processes, network              and relevant host based security, naming and addressing, routing,               acceptable use policies and how they may be implemented via                     protocols, accelerating the privatization of commodity                          network services via well structured networks and protocol support,             and peering at inter network exchange points.  Mr. Rosenthal would              join two other highly respected and competent individuals who                   currently perform the same function as members of the NSF                       Engineering Group (NEG), which reports to Bob Aiken, the DNCRI NREN             program manager.",
