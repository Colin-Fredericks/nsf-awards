 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine macroalgae exhibit phenotypic responses of their                         photosynthetic metabolism when grown at different temperatures.                 This thermal acclimation involves changes in cellular contents of               photosynthetic enzymes and pigments that enable seaweeds to                     maintain similar rates of light-limited and light-saturated                     photosynthesis over a range of growth temperatures.  Although these             responses are undoubtedly a major reason for the biological success             of seaweeds in low temperature environments, little is known about              either the effect of temperature on the organization of the                     photochemical apparatus (e.g., number and size of chlorophyll-                  pigment complexes), or the processes that regulate thermal                      acclimation.  This project will permit Dr. Davison to spend a                   year's sabbatical in 1993 working in the laboratories of Dr. P. G.              Falkowski (Brookhaven National Laboratory) and Dr. E. Gantt                     (university of Maryland) to learn modern molecular, biochemical and             biophysical techniques.  These techniques will then be used to                  address the following questions about thermal acclimation of                    photosynthesis. 1.  How is thermal acclimation regulated at the                 molecular level (i.e., transcription or translation)?  2.  How                  rapidly does the acclimation response occur.  3.  How does thermal              acclimation affect the organization and function of the                         photochemical apparatus?  For example, how does temperature affect              the stoichiometry of the various components of the photosystems and             the size and efficiency of energy transfer within the light-                    harvesting chlorophyll protein complexes? 4.  Does the apparent                 similarity between thermal acclimation and photoacclimation                     indicate that they are regulated by the same mechanism?  In                     particular, this project will test the hypothesis that thermal                  acclimation and photoacclimation are both regulated by the cellular             energy budget.  The techniques used will include:  (i) antibodies               and cDNA probes for measuring the cellular content and rates of                 synthesis (transcription) of mRNA that codes for the key proteins               of the photosynthetic apparatus and contents and synthesis                      (translation) of these proteins, (ii) a pump-probe fluorometer and              other biophysical techniques to measure the functional size of the              light-harvesting antennae associated with photosystems I and II and             to study energy transfer within and between chlorophyll-protein                 complexes, and (iii) immunocytochemistry to study the localization              of components of the photochemical apparatus on the thylakoid                   membranes.  The information obtained through this research should               substantially increase our understanding of the physiological                   processes that enable seaweeds to achieve high rates of                         productivity in low temperature environments.",
