 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lepidoptera Collection of the Milwaukee Public Museum                  (total holdings of 195,000 specimens) has grown significantly over              the past decade through acquisition of several significant donated              collections.  The Niedhofer Collection (95,000 specimens, 30,000                from Brazil) and the Sieker Collection (17,000 Neotropical                      specimens), as well as several smaller donated collections, are                 relatively inaccessible and have not been integrated with the rest              of the Department's holdings.  Dr. Allen Young, Curator of the                  Collection, proposes to integrate these collections into one                    comprehensive resource, and to improve the overall curation of the              collection.                                                                          The donated collections represent endangered habitats or areas             that have already been developed for human use.  Making these                   specimens accessible to scientists would have a significant impact              on current research on biodiversity, global climate change,                     biogeography, evolutionary biology, ecology, and conservation                   biology in tropical regions.  Supporting the growth and improvement             of natural history collections such as this are essential for                   future generations of biological research.",
