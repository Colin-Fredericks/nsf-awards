 "awd_abstract_narration": "Borough of Manhattan Community College is a large urban two-                    year college whose student body is two-third female, and over                   80% minority.  With a 1989-91 NSF Calculus Reform Grant they                    have succeeded in attracting and retaining more women and                       minorities in the Calculus sequence.  This was accomplished by                  adding computer-based collaborative workshops, based on the                     Treismann model, to Calculus I, II, and III.  It has become                     increasingly clear that to recruit and retain women and                         minorities the program must begin at an earlier level; so they                  are pushing their successful efforts back to the precalculus                    level.  With increased computer support they are attracting and                 preparing more women and minorities for careers in mathematics,                 science, and the technologies.",
