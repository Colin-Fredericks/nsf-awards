 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past 150 years, organic chemists were concerned with the                understanding of the covalent bond.  Recently, research on                      molecular recognition (generated by weak, non-covalent                          interactions) has been recognized worldwide as an important                     intellectual and technological frontier.  Endo- (generated by                   convergent cavities) and exo (generated by larger bodies of similar             size and shapes, or surfaces) molecular recognition,                            preorganization and self-organization provide the basis of                      spontaneous generation of functional supramolecular architectures               via self-assembly from their components.  It is now accepted that               molecular recognition directed synthesis and self-assembly are                  responsible for the generation and properties of biological                     systems.  This research aims to use molecular recognition both to               self-assemble synthetic supramolecular liquid crystalline polymers              and to direct their phase behavior.  Two novel classes of polymers              will be investigated:  functional supramolecular polymers which                 self-assemble by using principles that resemble those of tobacco                mosaic virus, and both cyclic main-chain polymers, as well as                   polymers containing liquid crystalline cyclophane (i.e., cyclic                 derivatives of main-chain liquid-crystalline oligomers) receptors               as structural units.  The second class of liquid-crystalline                    polymers will display molecular recognition directed phase                      transitions.  It is expected that this research will produce                    molecular devices such as self-assembled supramolecular synthetic               ion channels and various other systems which, by analogy with                   natural biological systems, will combine selective recognition with             external regulation.  Most important, this research will enable a               step ahead in understanding some of the processes that nature uses              and about which we know so little, and transplant them to the field             of synthetic su                                                                 pramolecular polymers.",
