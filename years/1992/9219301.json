 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is directed to the study of presynaptic NMDA-type                 glutamate receptors that are likely to be involved in the                       autoregulation of synaptic transmitter release.  NMDA receptors are             widely distributed in the central nervous system of all animals and             are intimately involved in normal neural processes such as learning             and memory as well as a number of pathological processes.  Little               is known of the presynaptic receptor function or structure since                there has not been an available source of receptors that are not                contaminated by the presence of the postsynaptic receptors in mixed             and complex neural tissues.  Because the olfactory epithelium is                composed of a pure population of neuronal cells and that it is a                presynaptic element the epithelium neurons can be a unique source               of the genetic message and receptor proteins that can be used to                generate the molecular tools to study presynaptic structure and                 function of the various neurotransmitter and modulator receptors                that may exist there.",
