 "awd_abstract_narration": "Repetitive movements such as chewing, walking, and swimming, which              are done relatively unconsciously, are controlled by groups of                  connected nerve cells known as central pattern generators (CPG).                The subject of this award to Dr. Peter Rowat will be modeling of                a CPG which controls buccal movements in an invertebrate; this                  system has been studied extensively over the past two decades and               a large amount of experimental data are available that can be used              for modeling the underlying mechanisms of this CPG. To investigate              these mechanisms, simplified, but biologically relevant,                        mathematical models will be developed; the output of these models               will then be compared with the experimentally observed CPG output.              The influence of neuromodulatory substances on the model will be                tested. Prediction of the most important biological components of               this CPG can be made by varying the strengths of components of the              model in computer simulations and by mathematical analysis. This                research will contribute to understanding the way in which                      repetitive movements are controlled by the central nervous system.",
