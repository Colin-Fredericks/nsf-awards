 "awd_abstract_narration": "International comparisons of prices,  real income,                         output and productivity have attracted considerable interest                    over the last two decades.  Much of the research in this area                   was initiated through the International Comparisons Project                     (ICP),  with funds from the World Bank.  Currently,  the                        Project is continuing its work under other governmental                         auspices,  notably,  the statistical offices of the United                      Nations and the European Economic Community. Its output is                      being used by a growing number of researchers as well as                        decision-makers,  but general understanding of the concepts                     and processes involved in producing these international                         indicators of economic performance remains modest.                                   The present proposal seeks support for conference on                       international economic comparisons to be held in the fall of                    1992.  The meeting will take place at the Center for Economic                   Research of Florida International University in Miami,                          Florida.  Its purpose is to elucidate recent methodological                     trends in the area of quantitative economic comparisons                         across countries and to expand the interaction of academic                      researchers with governmental as well as non-governmental                       specialists.  Papers will be presented under six broad                          topics:  economic theoretic approaches to international                         comparisons,  aggregation methods,  consistent temporal                         spatial comparisons, sectoral productivity comparisons,                         regional comparisons, and applications and policy issues.                            The distinguished group of participants in the proposed                    conference can be expected to contribute new insights and new                   momentum to an important area in international economics.                       Their discussions also promise to enhance general                               understanding of the current  \"state of the art\".",
