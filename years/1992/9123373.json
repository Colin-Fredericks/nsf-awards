 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Paul Goodey of the                                University of Oklahoma to collaborate with Professor                            Wolfgang Weil of the Mathematics Institute of the                               University of Karlsruhe, Germany.  Their collaboration                          focusses on problems which frequently have a three-                             dimensional motivation and involve the reconstruction of                        sets from knowledge of their cross sections or                                  projections into other sets.  Professor Goodey brings to                        the collaboration particular expertise in convexity and                         stereology while Professor Weil has made substantial                            contributions in stochastic geometry.                                                                                                                           The specific research problems to be discussed involve                          interactions between convex geometry and the Radon                              transform, and questions regarding translative integral                         geometry and stochastic geometry.  These problems can                           lead to various applications in mathematics as well as                          engineering, biology and medicine.  U.S. mathematics                            will benefit from exposure to significant research                              directions in Europe in this area, which has been                               dominated by Europeans.  The research proposed here                             includes important and difficult state-of-the-art                               problems and links two outstanding mathematicians who                           are contributing fundamental advances through their                             approach.",
