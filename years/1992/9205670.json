 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to investigate the                         petrographic and palynologic characteristics, surficial processes               of formation, and early stages of coalification of several                      contrasting tropical and subtropical peat deposits located in the               Caribbean/S. Florida region.  This research represents a                        continuation of work previously supported by NSF, with emphasis on              new and/or follow-up studies of certain sites and on certain                    promising new analytical techniques developed during the course of              the previous work (such as, artificial coalification experiments).                   Three tropical and one subtropical coal-forming settings have              been selected for study :1) the Moin coastal, palm swamp of Costa               Rica; 2) the Changuinola swamp-marsh complex of Panama; 3) the                  Arecibo sawgrass-mangrove swamp of Puerto Rico; and 4) the                      Everglades-mangrove swamp-marsh complex of Florida.  Although all               of these settings have similarities, each exhibits one or more                  significant differences from the others and was selected because                it is expected to yield new and essential information with which                to interpret and predict the composition and geometry of the many               ancient coals that have been reported in the literature to have                 formed in tropical shoreline-related settings.  Since the focus of              the previous grant was on the deposits in Panama and Costa Rica,                this proposal puts more emphasis on the Arecibo and Everglades                  deposits.                                                                            The methodology to be employed in this study will include: 1)              field measurements of pH, salinity and other surface conditions;                2) field descriptions of peat sequences: 3) collection of surface               litter and surface samples; 4) collection of oriented piston cores;             5) transmitted, reflected, and fluorescent light microscopy from                microtome thin sections; 6) low temperature ashing and x-ray                    diffraction for assessment of mineralogic content; and 7) pollen                analysis of surface and subsurface samples combined with                        radiocarbon dating, for interpreting the paleoecological and                    developmental history of the deposits.",
