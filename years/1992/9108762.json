 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                      (EPSCoR) in the state of Arkansas will enhance the research                     competitiveness of approximately 35 scientists in three                         research clusters: (1) Arkansas Neurobiology Research                           Center; (2) Center for Cellular and Molecular Studies on                        Biological Aging; and (3) Center for Protein Dynamics.                          Arkansas' effort is directed toward bringing three groups of                    scientists to a nationally-competitive level by funding                         equipment, graduate students, common facilities, and post-                      doctoral scientists, and by recruiting new faculty members.                     Outreach components of each group will draw undergraduate                       students and faculty from other institutions in the state to                    conduct research under as the direction of the nationally-                      competitive group leaders.   In addition to the clusters'                       outreach programs, the statewide EPSCoR Committee will                          administer the Visiting Scientists Program, providing                           funding for continued research at primarily undergraduate                       institutions.  A Public Awareness Program is funding the                        production of six half-hour documentaries featuring Arkansas                    scientists.  These documentaries, produced by the Arkansas                      Educational Television Network, will be shown on the public                     television stations and include corresponding educational                       materials so that the programs may be used in the public                        schools.  During the three year period of the award, state                      and institutions will contribute $3 million in support of                       EPSCoR'S objectives.",
