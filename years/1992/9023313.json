 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's primary areas of research interest are interactive proof               systems, fault tolerant distributed computation, cryptography.                  Research is projected in these areas.                                                                                                                           Interactive proofs, introduced by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff, are           an extension of the classical NP notion of what can be efficiently              verified.  Two new ingredients are added:  The verifier may be                  probabilistic and err slightly, and the verifier can interact with the          prover.  The PI plans to investigate for which class of problems it is          sufficient for the prover to be able to solve the problem itself.               This problem has direct application to program testing which will be            explored.                                                                                                                                                       The rapid development of distributed systems raises the natural                 question of what tasks can be performed by them (especially when                faults occur).  In the last four years it has been extensively                  studied, and to a large extent understood, how to perform any                   probabilistic computation on inputs distributed among processors in a           complete network so that no faulty subset of the processors gets any            additional information or can disrupt the computation.                                                                                                          Cryptography has recently developed from a primarily empirical field            of ad-hoc techniques to a formal discipline.  This rigor was                    accompanied by concrete and practical proposals of systems which were           shown, under a variety of candidate hard problems from number theory,           to comply with the new security standards.  At this time in the                 development of the field two projects should be undertaken: first,              the definitions for the different cryptographic tasks must be unified.          And second, new hard problems should be found (possibly from coding             theory or the geometry of numbers domain) on which to base                      cryptographic schemes.",
