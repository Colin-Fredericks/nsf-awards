Economic crisis in Latin America has forced both                                urban and rural households to explore ways to survive.                          These strategies include women entering the labor                               market in growing numbers, micro-enterprises,                                   production cooperatives, and community-based emergency                          organizations.  This new community activism, in which                           women have been prominent, has given rise to                                    substantial research by Latin and North American                                scholars.  This workshop will bring together 21                                 regional scholars from various disciplines to discuss                           current topics and compare North and South American                             perspectives.  It will also explore how responses of                            Latin American women to persistent poverty pertain to                           U.S. poverty workers.  Participants will meet with                              leaders of Los Angeles Latina communities and discuss                           women's experiences in confronting poverty through                              local efforts to ensure the social reproduction of new                          immigrant households.",
