 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research focusing on the               properties and applications of what is generally referred to as                 'lifting.'  By this one understands a framework in which a                      mathematical operation, applied to a certain set, can be shown to               be the restriction of another mathematical operation applied to a               larger set.  In many important cases, the lifting clarifies                     properties of the original operation and allows one to predict                  other characteristics which were not evident in the restricted                  environment.  Lifting can also show how disparate theories are                  parts of a larger whole.                                                             Work on this project concerns lifting properties of bilinear               forms known as Hankel forms.  Recent work established links                     between Krein's method of eigenfunction expansions in the                       integral representations of lifted forms to the Sz.Nagy-Foias                   lifting theory of positive operators.  The approach to the                      research brings together the Lebesgue spaces in which the Hilbert               transform acts continuously and dilation and lifting properties                 associated with scattering theory.  A fundamental result                        motivating this investigation is the n-conditional lifting                      theorem which leads to an opportunity to attack the classical                   interpolation problems in product spaces, where the main tools of               the theory of bounded analytic functions in one variable are just               not available.  A second group of problems centers on the band                  extension problem for matrices and related problems in control.                 This work seeks to extend the one-dimensional results of Gohberg                which tell when bounded functions with prescribed negative                      Fourier coefficients exist.  The question addressed in this work                will be the multiparametric case, which can be phrased entirely                 as a problem in lifting theory.  Other applications will be made                to Hankel operators and the Hilbert transform on the n-torus, on                the symplectic space, on the Heisenberg group and to the theory                 of non-stationary stochastic processes.",
