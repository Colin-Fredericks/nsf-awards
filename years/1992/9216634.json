 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this SGER proposal is to extend a truly novel                     observation of actin-based motility in axoplasmic extracts. The                 project calls for the histochemical characterization of the                     movement system via immunofluorescence and immunogold labelling. S1             decoration will be used to determine actin filament polarity in the             context of vectoral particle movement. In addition, the project                 aims toward the biochemical purification of the motor and its                   subsequent characterization in terms of its molecular structure,                and enzymatic properties in a longer-term aim of establishing its               ability to move particles along actin filaments in a totally-                   characterized system.                                                           %%%                                                                                 This project has the potential to alter our perception of                   axoplasmic particle movement significantly. During the last decade,             a growing literature has developed in favor of a microtubule-based              motility system for axoplasmic transport. Unidirectional motors                 that interact with microtubules and operate in anterograde or                   retrograde particle movement have dominated our thinking about the              process. Actin-based motility has received far less attention in                this process, though microfilaments have long been known to be                  present in the axoplasmic extracts that have served as the starting             material for the particle movement assays. It is now clear that                 microfilaments may also serve in particle movement. The clear                   demonstration that actin-based motility is vectorial, and dependent             on the polarity of the actin filaments under physiologically-                   relevant conditions would be a major contribution to our                        understanding of cell motility.",
