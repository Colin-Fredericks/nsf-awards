 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analysis of homologous gene sequences among closely related                mammalian species reveals that different genes within a genome                  evolve at different rates.  The rate of gene variation is related               to the nucleotide composition of the gene, specifically, to the                 guanine+cytosine content.  In mammalian cells dGTP is almost                    invariably the least abundant deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate                  (dNTP) in the proximal DNA precursor pool.  If dGTP levels are                  subsaturating for replicative DNA polymerases, replication fidelity             can be affected, both by competition with more abundant nucleotides             for insertion opposite template cytosines, and by increased                     proofreading upstream from dGMP in newly synthesized DNA.  We will              analyze replication fidelity in vitro in a forward mutation assay               system developed by Roberts and Kunkel (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA              85, 7064 (1988).  This system uses a modified M13 phage template                that contains an SV40 viral replication origin and a portion of the             E. coli lacZ gene and control region.  Mutations in the lac                     sequence target, arising during replication by a HeLa cell extract,             are scored by a plaque assay in the presence of a chromogenic                   substrate.  First we will ask whether this system, when provided                with dNTP mixtures that approximate the intranuclear environment,               yields mutation frequencies significantly different from those seen             with an equimolar dNTP mixture.  The critical test, however, will               be to systematically vary the GC content of the target DNA sequence             without changing its coding properties, and to ask whether mutation             frequencies vary as a function of GC content when replicated in the             presence of asymmetric dNTP mixtures.  The GC content variation                 will involve substitution of chemically synthesized                             oligonucleotides for portions of the natural lacZ sequence.                     %%%                                                                             It is important to know the parameters which are associated with                mutations in mammalian cells in order to better control them.  The              information from this study will advance our ability to do so.",
