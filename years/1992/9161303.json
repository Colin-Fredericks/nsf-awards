 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed at development of a method for                            combustion- flame production of diamond films; this method has                  the potential for deposition of large area films on complex                     shapes.  In this work, flames will be supported in a                            combustion chamber wivh subsequent expansion of the product                     flame gases through  a converging-diverging nozzle to form a                    supersonic jet which will be directed against a substrate for                   deposition of the desired films.  This approach has the                         potential to mitigate previous problems associated with                         diamond-film deposition such as poor uniformity and high                        levels of grain impurities via control of the chemical                          reactions and transport phenomena, thus leading to efficient                    and uniform utilization of the combustion-generated active                      species in production of high-quality diamond films.  The                       basic principles involved in this approach are: isolate the                     active portion of the fuel-rich combustion product cloud                        (which contains high levels of species which lead to diamond                    deposition); freeze the chemistry in that cloud through the                     rapid nozzle expansion process; transport this \"frozen\" stream                  rapidly to the surface to be coated; modify the                                 uniformity/composition/temperature in an optimum fashion in                     transit; and establish a thin, uniform boundary layer at the                    substrate surface across which the active species can diffuse                   to strike the growing diamond film.                                                                                                                             The proposed method for applying combustion-generated diamond                   films will significantly impact a potential billion dollar                      market.  When perfected, this new technique will provide a                      practical, portable, low-cost method of applying diamond                        coatings to materials as diverse as machine tools and                           electronic parts.",
