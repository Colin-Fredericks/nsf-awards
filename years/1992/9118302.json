 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two approaches are proposed to investigate substrate specificity                and catalytic mechanisms of two different enzymes, citrate synthase             (CS) and serine carboxypeptidase (CPD).  The first will be an X-ray             crystallographic analysis of the structures of the enzymes and to               compare ligand affinities and catalytic activity of related or                  mutant forms of the enzymes.  The second will be to investigate the             role of electrostatic fields in the mechanisms by use of                        theoretical calculations.                                                                                                                                       Citrate synthase is one of few enzymes capable of directly forming              a carbon bond.   A detailed mechanism for part of the reaction has              been proposed.  Site-directed mutants of CS with differing activity             have been constructed.  Their structures will be analyzed by                    crystallographic techniques, enzyme kinetics and electrostatic                  field calculations to study the roles of selected side chains.                                                                                                  Serine carboxypeptidases are highly specific proteinases which are              essential for the maturation of peptide hormones.  They are                     unrelated to other serine proteinases, but have the same active                 site groups.  Analysis of inhibitor binding will determine the                  basis for substrate specificity.  Selected mutants of yeast CPD                 will be studied to determine the basis for the unusual pH                       dependence of the reaction and to test whether the enzymatic                    mechanism is similar to that proposed for other serine proteinases.",
