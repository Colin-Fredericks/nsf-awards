 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on the occurrence of                       chelating agents in surface waters and the role they play                       in determining the quality of natural surface waters.  The                      investigator plans to obtain direct experimental data on                        the role played by phytochelatins, newly discovered, water                      soluble, metal sequestering compounds, naturally occurring                      in phytoplankton that may provide the dominant source of                        strong chelating agents in natural waters that in turn                          influence water quality.  Following development and                             application of the analytical techniques, the project will                      involve field studies of sources and sinks of chelating                         agents, and systematic determination of their                                   thermodynamic and kinetic properties.                                                                                                                           Results of this project are expected to provide a basis                         for determining the role of natural chelating agents in                         affecting the fate and biological effects of trace metals                       such as copper, zinc and cadmium in natural waters.                             Knowledge of this may have a significant effect on                              engineering design and location of wastewater treatment                         facilities to minimize their undesirable impact on water                        quality such as initiation of algal blooms.",
