 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three of the four carbon chemistry properties in seawater will be               determined during the JGOFS time-series expeditions in the                      Central Equatorial Pacific Ocean, which have been scheduled for                 March 1992 and November 1992, a total of 67 days at sea.                                                                                                        The total inorganic carbon concentration will be determined using               an automated coulometric system; the CO2 fugacity using an                      equilibrator/infra-red procedure; and the total alkalinity using                the potentiometric acid titration.  The total inorganic carbon                  and the total alkalinity will be measured at sea in discrete                    seawater samples collected throughout the water column at the                   time-series stations.  Furthermore, the measurement of these                    three parameters in surface seawater will provide the means to                  critically evaluate the consistency and reliability of each of                  these data sets.  The accuracy of both total CO2 and total                      alkalinity will be controlled by measuring reference solutions by               A. Dickson.                                                                                                                                                     The processed data will be (1) quality controlled according to                  the criteria that soon will be established by the DOE sponsored                 committee responsible for CO2 data quality management, (2)                      tabulated and added to the JGOFS data base for distribution to                  the scientific community, and (3) used in conjunction with                      associated measurements both to give a descriptive account of the               results and to quantify the processes involved in the                           spatiotemporal variations of the properties of the oceanic carbon               cycle.",
