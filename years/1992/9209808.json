 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a rising need for high-performance, multi-variable                     control in the chemical process industries to enable                            corporations to maintain a competitive edge during rapidly                      changing market conditions and increasing concerns for energy                   conservation and environmental protection.  These new                           controllers will have to deal with the following factors:  (1)                  more control problems involving highly interactive processes                    with a large number of inputs and outputs will result from                      increased plant integration; (2) more control problems will                     involve constraints since the economic optimization forces the                  plant to be operated close to the intersection of constraints;                  and (3) control problems will embody more nonlinear/time-                       varying aspects because of frequently changing operating                        conditions and increased number of sensors and actuators.                       Three serious issues arise for designing control systems for                    large-scale, interactive processes subject to constraints:                      ensuring robustness to model uncertainty, minimizing the                        effects of constraints and monitoring and maintaining                           performance of the control system in the face of a changing                     plant environment with minimal human intervention.                                                                                                              The objective of this project is to develop an integrated                       recursive-identification/control technique that is needed to                    generate high-performance, multi-variable controllers with the                  capability of adapting to changes in the environment.  A                        recursive identification algorithm that provides a family of                    possible models and a predictive control algorithm minimizing                   the \"worst-case\" error for all possible models are to be                        developed.  The recursive identification algorithm is to be                     equipped with the intelligence to reset the model parameters                    and uncertainty bounds appropriately from on-line data when a                   sudden change in the plant dynamics occurs.  Together they                      comprise a multi-variable, self-tuning control algorithm that                   can maintain high and robust performance despite little a                       priori information on the plant dynamics and changing                           operating conditions.  A novel model uncertainty                                quantification method based on the \"finite impulse response                     (FIR)\" model structure is to be employed.  The research effort                  will span a wide array of system and control technology                         including identification, robust control, predictive control,                   robust control and artificial intelligence, and involve a                       comprehensive blend of theory, experimentation and simulation.",
