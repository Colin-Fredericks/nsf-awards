 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the basic goals of evolutionary biology is to assess the                 extent and the nature of the genetic variability that occurs in                 natural populations and to determine the roles that different types             if variants play in adaptive evolutionary change.  In recent years,             a great deal of information has been obtained about the variability             of DNA sequences in natural populations.  However, there is still               very little information about the possible effects of the sequence              variants on the phenotype of the organism.  The general goal of                 this project is to begin to fill this gap by determining the                    molecular basis (in terms of DNA sequence variations) of naturally              occurring variation in the expression of the enzyme alcohol                     dehydrogenase (Adh) in model organism, the fruit fly Drosophila.The             specific goals of the project are briefly summarized below.Previous             studies have shown that a large part of the genetic variation of                ADH activity levels within D. melanogaster populations is                       associated with the segregation of two common allozymes, which                  differ by a single amino acid,  Fast homozygotes generally have a               two to three fold higher activity level than Slow homozygotes for               two reasons:  they have a higher concentration of ADH protein and               the Fast protein has a higher catalytic efficiency.  One specific               goal of the proposed work is to determine what DNA sequence                     alteration(s) cause this ADH concentration difference between the               allozymic classes.  A second specific goal is to investigate the                genetic and molecular of a threefold difference in ADH expression               between two species, D. simulans and sechellia.",
