 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a research collaboration                                between Professor Fletcher of East Carolina University                          and Professor Lourival D. Possani of the Universidad                            Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in Mexico City.  The                                investigators intend to specifically identify the                               receptor proteins in mammalian pancreas that are                                targeted by scorpion venom toxic proteins to activate                           exocrine secretory discharge.  Identification will                              measure venom protein binding and localize the                                  receptors at the cellular level.  The work is expected                          to lead to the isolation and characterization of these                          receptors.                                                                                                                                                      The U.S. laboratory will supply the Mexican laboratory                          with biotinylated and radiolabled scorpion venom                                proteins while the Mexican laboratory will provide                              synthetic peptide analogs of the venom proteins.  Both                          laboratories will use scorpion venom supplied by the                            Buntanton Institute in Brazil.  Interest in exploring                           these venoms and their effect on the pancreas is high                           because they share no features in common with proteins                          and peptides previously described that are also known                           to act on the exocrine pancreas.  These studies seem                            to include that certain excitatory behavior, usually                            associated with nerve and muscle cells, may also occur                          in epithelial tissue and thus may increase our                                  understanding of receptor-mediated secretory activity                           of these tissues.",
