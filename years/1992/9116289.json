 "awd_abstract_narration": "Of all the mineral phases found in the marine environment,                      carbonates of various biological origins have proven to be the                  richest repository of paleoceanographic/paleoclimatic                           information.  Two classes of chemical indicators, stable isotopes               and trace elements, have been developed in two principal host                   phases, foraminiferal calcite and coral aragonite.  As biological               systems, however, foraminifera and reef corals are capable of                   leaving metabolic imprints on top of chemical signals which                     record environmental change.  The nature of these imprints must                 be understood to accurately reconstruct oceanic conditions during               Earth's history.  Over the last several decades, a process                      framework has evolved to permit the interpretation of such                      signals in ancient foraminifera.  The intent of this proposal is                to initiate a similar framework for metal incorporation by                      corals.                                                                                                                                                         4 fundamental process issues and their effect on metal (including               Cd, Mn, Pb, V, Ba, U) and isotopic precipitation (18O and 13C)                  will be addressed in this work: (1) growth rate, (2)                            species variability, (3) reef spatial variability, and (4)                      digenetic influences on thousand year timescales, taking                        advantage of existing samples and the ease of cross dating short                growth intervals within specimens from a single reef to form                    detailed comparisons.  This approach offers many advantages to a                difficult and costly culturing study.  Numerous species collected               live from Pacific, Atlantic, and Caribbean sites will form the                  sample basis.  The diagenesis study component will utilize                      precisely dated (U-Th) materials from Barbados to address the                   feasibility of interpreting Pleistocene trace metal records in                  fossil corals.",
