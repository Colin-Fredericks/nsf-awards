 "awd_abstract_narration": "Late Carboniferous (Stephanian B-C) collections at Ohio                    University include over 7,000 three-dimensional, cellularly                     preserved plant fossils from North American midcontinent                        cyclothems.  This is the best preserved and most stratigraphically              complete collection of Stephanian plant fossils in the world.  The              plants from each cyclothem are preserved in offshore marine shales              and constitute an assemblage from a diverse suite of terrestrial                environments.  Systematic analysis using thin sectioning, peel                  techniques and scanning electron microscopy to document the                     cellular features will determine which Stephanian plant groups are              present and identify new taxa.                                                       Typically, very few offshore marine units contain well                     preserved terrestrial plant debris.  The taphonomic constraints                 influencing preservation of these Stephanian plants deposited in                cyclothem beds of middle to outer shelf offshore marine                         environments have not been fully determined.  Marine organism                   interaction with the transported plant debris and an understanding              of the depositional conditions will resolve the taphonomic pathways             involved.                                                                            This combined research on plant systematics and marine                     taphonomic constraints is significant because it allows the first               extensive documentation and analysis of terrestrial floras in the               offshore marine environment.  This data base will allow detailed                comparison with rare Stephanian floral communities from coal swamps             and the drier  upland environments.",
