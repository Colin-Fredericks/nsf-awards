 "awd_abstract_narration": "This continuing investigation of geometric structures on                   manifolds and discrete groups will concentrate on complex                       hyperbolic geometry, spherical CR geometry, flat Lorentzian                     geometry, conformal 3-dimensional geometry, and real projective                 geometry.  These geometries are intimately interrelated, yet each               displays its own characteristic personality.  Direct constructions              of discrete groups by fundamental polyhedra (in the spirit of                   Poincare) in geometries in which totally geodesic hypersurfaces                 either do not exist or are not sufficiently flexible to build                   fundamental polyhedra, have led to alternate notions of half-spaces             and hypersurfaces.  The investigator has analyzed how such                      hypersurfaces intersect and the possible combinatorial types for                polyhedra built from these objects.  He applies this theory to the              geometry and topology of moduli spaces of geometric structures on               a manifold, these spaces being closely related to the better known              moduli space of representations of a manifold's fundamental group,              a structure profitably studied using gauge-theoretic techniques.                The prototype of such moduli spaces is Teichmueller space, and one              objective of this project is to see how the geometry of                         Teichmueller space extends to these more general moduli spaces.                      Despite the fact that we live in a 3-dimensional manifold, our             intuition quickly fails us as a guide to the truth or falsity of                fairly simple questions about their general geometric and                       topological properties.  Nor is it terribly helpful in telling us               where to look for answers.  An elaborate theory has been developed              which is growing by leaps and bounds and has been far more                      successful than raw intuition, one of the most surprising features              of the theory being the prominent role that a non-Euclidean                     geometry, so-called hyperbolic geometry, occupies in this theory.               Other special geometric structures also have been exploited in                  similar ways, somewhat as a scaffolding is used in constructing a               building:  One asks a topological question about a manifold,                    something intrinsically independent of geometry.  One then imposes              a geometric structure, deduces properties that seem to depend upon              this geometric structure (and some of which, as intermediate steps,             actually do depend upon it), and finally in a sense kicks away the              scaffolding to reveal the desired answer to the original question.              By this I mean that one observes that one has deduced a result that             does not mention the geometric structure explicitly, and that one               then succeeds in showing that any other choice for the geometric                structure would have led to the same final result.  This is only                one intriguing aspect of such research, for it is true that the                 geometric structures involved have now attracted a considerable                 amount of interest in their own right.",
