 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agricultural ecosystems are key elements of the life support               systems of all developed societies.  These systems are so                       dominated by human factors that a reasonable understanding of                   their responses to large-scale changes in the physical                          environment necessarily requires consideration of economic                      influences on human decision making, which modulate the                         biophysical aspects of agricultural production.  The economics,                 in turn, are critically influenced by the biological responses to               the physical environment, which determine yield potential and                   commodity supplies.  A credible treatment of these interactions                 requires integration of physical, biological and social science                 approaches and tools.                                                                This research project will jointly assess the predicted                    economic and agricultural impacts of evolving climate changes                   caused by gradually increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.  A                recently developed methodology, which focuses on the response of                farm-level decisions to changes in the physical environment, will               form the basis of the study.  The project will consider the major               grain crops of North America, for which reasonably comprehensive                agronomic, climatological and economic data are available.                           The proposed research will contribute to the scientific                    understanding of interactions between human and biophysical                     determinants of food production and prices in the context of a                  changing climate.  It will track the effects of gradual climate                 changes through a set of physiological crop models to a                         sequential linear programming model of farm-level decision                      making, and is thus truly interdisciplinary in nature.  The                     results will provide tools which can contribute usefully to                     informed decisions regarding the consequences of both energy and                agricultural policy on landscape patterns, food production and                  prices.",
