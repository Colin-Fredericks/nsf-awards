 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the classic model compounds for membrane ion channel                     permeation is Amphotericin B, although the structure of the channel             is still unknown.  This polyene macrolide is thought to form ion                permeable pores in lipid membranes by organizing into a barrel                  stave like arrangement of molecules with the polar polyol region in             the middle.  However, the size and nature of the channels seem to               vary depending upon which sterol, ergosterol or cholesterol, is                 present in the phospholipid membrane.  The supramolecular structure             of such channels may be revealed by studying its ion permeation                 properties, especially the selectivity sequence of related ions                 (e.g. the alkali metal series).  The three basic goals for this                 research are: 1)Obtain complete Group IA and IIA metal cation and               halide selectivity sequences for Amphotericin channels in different             phospholipid and sterol membrane environments, 2) Determine the                 temperature dependence, aggregation state and molecularity of                   channel formation in these environments, 3) Using these data in                 conjunction with electrostatic molecular modeling software, design              consistent models for Amphotericin channel structures.                          %%%                                                                             Biological membrane ion channels play a central role in many                    processes from neurotransmission to cystic fibrosis.  This research             should advance on knowledge of Amphotericin channels and ion                    channels in general.",
