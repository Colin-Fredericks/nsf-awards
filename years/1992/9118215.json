 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regulation of differential mRNA stability is an important control               step in plastid gene expression.  Dr. Gruissem has shown that                   ribosome association and structures in the mRNA are important                   determinants for the decay of chloroplast mRNAs.  Inverted repeat               sequences (IR-RNAs) in the 3' untranslated region of chloroplast                mRNAs function as cis-regulatory determinants for mRNA 3' end                   processing and stability , and interact with RNA-binding proteins.              Three of the RNA-binding proteins have been purified and sequenced              and the gene for the proteins has been cloned.  Two RNA-binding                 proteins have been identified and partially purified that                       specifically interact with the 3' IR-RNA of one mRNA.  It is                    proposed to continue the functional analysis of the RNA-binding                 proteins in chloroplast mRNA metabolism and stability using in                  vitro reconstituted systems, and by genetic interference of the                 expression of their genes in Arabidopsis.  A biochemical and                    molecular approach is presented to determine how ribosome                       association contributes to the different half-lives of chloroplast              mRNAs.                                                                          %%%                                                                             Dissection of the molecular mechanisms by which chloroplast                     mRNA stability is accomplished will provide novel and general                   information about the nuclear control of organelle gene expression.             Regulation of mRNA processing and stability is an important                     mechanism in control of gene expression in virtually all organisms.             Despite the wide-spread occurrence of mRNA stability control, our               understanding of this type of regulation is still cryptic and                   incomplete.//",
