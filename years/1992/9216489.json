 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural                   anthropologist from Stanford University studying how costume is                 used by people in the Ecuadorian Andes to express ethnic                        identity.  Using participant observation and the analysis of                    media in four areas of Ecuador varying in the degree of                         indigenous dress as well as wealth and commercialization, the                   project will analyze changes in indigenous costume and how native               dress is used as a political symbol.                                                                                                                            This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of how people manipulate symbols of ethnic identity               to achieve goals with respect to local and regional governments.                Local costume is used as an ethnic marker in many parts of the                  world, and rather than disappearing as people \"modernize\", is                   increasing in selective ways.  This project will advance our                    understanding of how material culture is manipulated by people                  for political and social goals. By showing how outsiders'                       representations of ethnic groups perpetuate ethnic stereotypes                  and exacerbate racial tensions, the research can provide valuable               information on how to alleviate these tensions.",
