 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will address the evolutionary dynamics of                 colonization in newly-founded populations of Lupinus lepidus var.               lobii, an important plant colonist of the blast zone at Mt. Saint               Helens.  Preliminary data indicate that these populations are                   genetically differentiated from each other over small spatial                   scales.  The scale and magnitude of this differentiation will be                documented, and the ecological and demographic factors which may                affect future differentiation will be studied.  Measurements of                 population growth rate, age structure, seedbank dynamics, and                   outcrossing rates will be made in different aged populations, and               in artificial founder populations.  These parameters and genetic                data will allow estimation of a key evolutionary parameter,                     effective population size, and its rate of growth after a                       population bottleneck.  Gene flow between populations will be                   measured using genetic data for small populations.  Effective size,             gene flow, and estimates of patch turnover will be incorporated in              simulations of metapopulation genetic models.  Finally, the                     potential for stochastic differentiation will be compared to                    results from transplant experiments designed to elucidate the                   magnitude of and spatial variation in selection pressures.  This                research will provide insight into the relative importance of drift             and selection during the founding of populations, and information               of central value in understanding the recovery of naturally or                  artificially damaged ecological systems.",
