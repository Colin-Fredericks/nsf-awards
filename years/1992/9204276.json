 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research of Andreas Blass is in three areas:  (1)                      combinatorial set theory, particularly the study of cardinal                    characteristics of the continuum;  (2) logic of topoi, particularly             connections between geometric morphisms of topoi, the internal                  higher-order logic, and domains for denotational semantics; and                 (3) game semantics for linear logic and related systems.                             Set theory provides the popular way to lay the foundations for             all of mathematics, the best known systematic attempt to do this                being Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, dating from                the early days of the 20th Century.  Important foundational                     questions concern the independence and the consistency of the                   axioms used to establish set theory.  Zermelo and Fraenkel's axioms             (ZF for short) are one of the most convenient sets of basic axioms.             However, it has been known since the work of Kurt Goedel in the                 1930's that no axioms for set theory can be complete as well as                 consistent.  This means that no set of axioms can be powerful                   enough to prove every possible proposition or else its negation,                but not both.  Upon this startling theorem has been erected a rich              theory, treating possible propositions P such that either P or Not              P can be added to ZF without resulting in a contradiction.  Any                 such proposition P is said to be independent of ZF and can be taken             as an additional axiom of set theory.  The principal technique for              finding such independent propositions is Paul J. Cohen's so-called              method of forcing and its offspring.  This is the circle of ideas               involved in and motivating a large part of the investigator's                   research.",
