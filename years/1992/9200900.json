 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tolerance synthesis is a major task of product and process                 design and is in a period of extensive study due both to increased              demands for quality products and to increasing automation of                    machining and assembly.  Optimum tolerance design and synthesis                 ensures good quality product at low cost.  The primary goal of this             research project is to develop an analytical methodology for                    concurrent optimization of design and manufacturing tolerance                   syntheses to enhance product manufacturability, quality and cost                effectiveness.  Based on a more complete understanding of the                   relationships between dimensional tolerance and machining cost,                 process capability and tolerance, mathematical models for these                 relationships are to be formulated.  As its objective function the              minimum manufacturing cost, and optimization model for concurrent               tolerance syntheses will then be developed based on the above                   relationships.  The project will extend and augment previous                    research on the development of solution procedures for the                      tolerance optimization model.  In particular, simulated annealing               algorithm and discrete optimization techniques will be investigated             and implement.                                                                        This research project will tie together disparate efforts                 that tend to treat design tolerance synthesis and manufacturing                 tolerance allocation as separate problems.  The goal is to achieve              more economical manufacturing                                                   through tolerance optimization.",
