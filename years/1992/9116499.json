 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal goal of the proposed research is a fundamental                    understanding of the structural and catalytic roles played by the               metal ions and protein moieties in nitrite and nitrous oxide                    reductases.  Extensive spectroscopic and chemical studies on                    these reductases are proposed.  These classes of multicopper                    redox enzymes provide new opportunities to investigate                          structure/function relationships in copper-containing enzymes                   that are involved in denitrification.  Dr. Dooley will also                     address questions concerning the possible regulation of theses                  enzymes by intermediates in the denitrification pathway.  In                    addition a partially copper-depleted form of N2O reductase,                     isolated from a mutant strain of Pseudomonas stutzeri, will be                  thoroughly characterized.  The spectroscopic properties of Cu(II)               will be exploited as a built-in probe of the active site by                     variable temperature X-ray absorption spectroscopy circular                     dichroism, magnetic circular dichroism resonance Raman, and EPR                 spectroscopy.  Dr. Dooley plans to develop a N2O-specific                       electrode assay for activity which would facilitate kinetics and                mechanism studies of N2O reductase.  Effects of exogenous ligands               (inhibitors, denitrification intermediates, substrate analogs)                  and pH on the spectral properties and kinetics of the copper                    reductases will also be investigated.  Integrating results from                 spectroscopic experiments and mechanistic studies will permit new               structure/reactivity/function correlations among multicopper                    oxidases and reductases to be formulated.  Understanding the                    relationships between the structures and mechanisms of nitrite                  and N2O reductases is expected to play an essential role in                     developing rational strategies to control and exploit biological                denitrification.",
