 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric deposition, as rainfall and dryfall, is an                          increasingly important source of biologically-utilizable nitrogen               in estuarine and coastal regions: about 30% of their combined                   nitrogen loading comes from atmospheric sources.  Nitrogen from                 atmospheric deposition may be a unique source of nitrogen in                    coastal waters, as direct surface water deposition may occur                    downstream of estuarine nutrient stripping zones that assimilate                the majority of terrigenous nitrogen loading.  Moreover, analyses               of rainwater reveals that dissolved organic matter can be a                     significant fraction of the total dissolved nitrogen in                         precipitation from both continental and oceanic origins.  This                  nitrogen from rainfall has been shown to stimulate primary                      production in coastal waters adjacent to North Carolina.  Impacts               of atmospheric nitrogen deposition will be elucidated by assessing              algal primary production and trophic responses with complementary               bioassays and stable isotope tracers measurements at the natural                abundance level.  The three sources of nitrogen in rainwater                    (nitrate, ammonium, and dissolved organic nitrogen) will be                     followed into primary producers with stable isotopes, while                     species composition and photosynthetic rates are monitored.  The                transfer of primary products from algae to both microbial and                   zooplankton populations will be assayed to investigate the                      response of grazing and the microbial loop to increased                         productivity.  A quantitative model and budget of nitrogen                      entering the area from atmospheric deposition will be the final                 result of the study.  Results may be useful to global modelers                  attempting to assess the importance of atmospheric deposition on                climate and species diversity.",
