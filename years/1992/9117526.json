 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this project is to examine how reduction               of dimensionality, electrostatic potentials, and other physical                 factors affect the production of second messengers.                             Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cs (PLC's), which are                   found both in the cytoplasm and the membrane hydrolyze                          phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a lipid found on                  the cytoplasmic surface of cell membranes, to produce the second                messengers inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylgercerol.  The                 working hypothesis is that PLC's bind to acidic lipids in                       biological membranes, producing a loss of dimensionality that                   increases the binding of the PLC's to other membrane proteins and               to their substrate, PIP2.  Preliminary work has demonstrated that               PLC's bind with high affinity to acidic lipids in phospholipid                  bilayers. Gel filtration, a novel centrifugation separation                     technique, microelectrophoresis, fluorescence quenching, stopped                flow, and surface radioactivity experiments will be used to                     measure the equilibrium and kinetic aspects of the binding with                 phospholipid vesicles and monolayers.  The novel theoretical                    prediction that dimensionality and electrostatics can produce                   apparent cooperativity when basic residues on proteins bind to                  acidic lipids in membranes will be tested with small basic                      peptides and phospholipid vesicles.  Dialysis, filtration,                      mobility, fluorescence and stopped flow measurements will be used               to examine the equilibrium and kinetic aspects of the binding and               to search for lateral phase separation of acidic lipids.",
