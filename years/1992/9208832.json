 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Lawrence Straus and               his collaborators will continue research at two paleolithic                     archaeological sites, both located in Southern Belgium.                         Preliminary work was conducted at both in 1990 and excavation                   indicated that in situ archaeological materials were present.                   Trou Magrite is a cave which contains an extended sequence which                spans Mousterian (prior to ca. 40,000 years ago) through                        following Upper Paleolithic times. A second site, Huccorgne, is                 located in open air and contains a single archaeological horizon                which dates to Gravettian times ca. 23,000 years ago. This marks                an extremely cold period when glaciers extended far South in                    Europe. Both sites are rich in cultural materials including well                preserved faunal material. Dr. Straus and his collaborators will                return to both in the summer of 1992 and conduct archaeological                 excavations. A variety of materials will then be analyzed to                    reconstruct the changing environment and human adaptation to it.                                                                                                Archaeologists are extremely interested in this time period in                  Europe for several reasons. First, approximately 40,000 years ago               a major transition in both culture and human physical type took                 place. Neanderthal peoples who manufactured distinctive                         Mousterian type stone tools disappeared from the archaeological                 record. About this time the first anatomically modern humans (as                determined through skeletal remains) first appear in Europe. A                  different type of culture with a new stone tool technology and                  practices such as the production of art accompany this                          transition. Although this change can be observed, the underlying                processes responsible for it are little understood. It is unclear               whether one group replaced another or whether in situ development               took place. Dr. Straus excavations should shed light on this                    question. They should also provide additional insight into the                  methods humans with a simple technology employed to cope with a                 harsh and changing environment.                                                                                                                                 This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to a large number of archaeologists. It will                   increase our understanding of the emergence of modern humans and                the adaptive strategies associated with this.",
