 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research program for a novel electron                                         cyclotron resonance (ECR) reactor for                                           dry etching and deposition is proposed.                                         The toroidal ECR reactor (TECR) uses a                                          unique magnetic geometry which offers                                           great potential benefits; (1) greatly                                           reduced exposure of the wafer to high-                                          energy photon radiation and associated                                          wafer heating, (2) uniformity of etching                                        over 8-inch wafers while maintaining                                            etching rates which are comparable to                                           conventional ECR sources (on the order                                          of 1 micron/minute. (3) the ability to                                          separate the ion composition from that                                          of the neutral composition striking the                                         wafer, and (4) very directional ion                                             fluxes that reduce pattern dependencies                                         in the etching of submicron features.                                           The design permits the separation of the                                        glow discharge from the wafer by using                                          magnetic field lines to guide the                                               transport of electrons and ions to the                                          wafer.  The etching uniformity across                                           the wafer can be adjusted by trimming                                           the solenoidal magnetic field, and thus,                                        can be controlled independently of the                                          process chemistry and discharge                                                 kinetics.  In Phase I, the basic physics                                        of the reactor will be modelled, a                                              prototype reactor be designed and                                               engineering drawings produced.",
