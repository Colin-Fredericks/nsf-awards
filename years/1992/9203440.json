 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project continues mathematical research on the                application of viscosity solutions to problems arising in the                   theory of nonlinear partial differential equations.  One                        particularly interesting direction the research has led to                      involves the geometric problem of describing how a surface                      evolves in the direction of the normal at each point if the rate                of evolution is proportional to the curvature (at the point).                   The physical counterparts of such questions can be found in                     studies of phase transition and wave front propagation.  Recent                 results show that weak solutions describe the evolution to the                  point where regularity breaks down.  Work still must be done                    analyzing solutions at the onset of breakdown.                                       Other work concerns the regularity of harmonic maps.  Here                 efforts will be made to expand a new regularity result valid for                maps to the sphere to one for stationary harmonic maps into                     general target manifolds.  As examples of regularity failure                    exist for domains in dimension greater than two, one cannot                     expect any results of complete generality here.  Work will also                 be done on two-dimensional Euler equations with vortex sheet                    initial data.  Of interest is the occurrence of weak convergence                of sequences of solutions to the 2-D incompressible Euler under                 physically reasonable assumptions on the velocity and vorticity.                The issue is whether or not a weak limit of solutions is still a                solution.  Informal calculations suggest that a tractable                       solution to this question is possible.",
