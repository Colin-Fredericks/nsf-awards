 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wade Sherbrooke is the Director of the Southwestern                    Research Station, which is owned and administered by the American               Museum of Natural History.  The Station is located in the                       Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona in an area of                      diverse desert and montane habitats.  Research projects conducted               at the Station focus on a broad spectrum of species and topics.                 Dr. Sherbrooke proposes construction of enclosures for behavioral               studies and acquisition of museum storage cabinets for specimens                collected during research projects, specimen freezer, analytical                balance, and electric current stabilizer.                                            The behavioral enclosures will facilitate research by a                    large number of visiting investigators, and will open up new                    research projects on diverse organisms.  The specimen storage                   equipment is critical for the proper curation of reference                      specimens and for preservation of frozen tissues for biochemical                analyses.  These items of equipment will provide significant                    benefits to a variety of research projects.",
