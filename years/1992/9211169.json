 "awd_abstract_narration": "A successful controller design paradigm must take                               into account both model uncertainty and                                         performance specifications.  Model uncertainty can                              be used successfully addressed using the Hoo robust                             control framework.  However, this framework                                     cannot accommodate the realistic case where in                                  addition to robustness considerations, the system is                            subject to both time and frequency domain                                       performance specifications.  In this research we                                propose to develop a robust control framework that                              takes explicitly into account these specifications.                             Specifically, the objectives of the proposed research                           are:  1) Development of a set of simple measures                                to describe how well a given set of performance                                 specifications is satisfied in the presence of                                  uncertainty.  2) Development of a controller                                    synthesis procedure that uses extra degrees of                                  freedom available in the problem to maximize an                                 appropriate performance measure over the set of                                 controllers that achieve a desired robustness level.                            This research will use the Youla parametrization to                             cast the problem into constrained optimization                                  form.  This research effort will result in an                                   expanded Hoo framework, capable of addressing                                   realistic problems without necessitating                                        approximations nor multiple trial and error type                                iterations, thus leading to improved and less costly                            designs.  The resulting framework will be used to                               design controllers for thermal power plants and                                 flexible structures.  As part of the research effort,                           these controllers will be tested both using                                     simulations and prototype structure.",
