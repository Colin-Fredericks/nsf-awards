 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will provide funding to employ and train a                         total of 61 minority participants, who will enter into one                      of three different program categories.  The first category                      will be for 11 young professionals - minority individuals                       who have both special needs and abilities.  Their needs are                     for continued specialized training to facilitate career                         advancement and they would, as would the other two classes                      of interns, benefit greatly from the establishment of a                         support network encompassing other minority individuals                         interested in careers in science museums.  They also have                       unique abilities, stemming from their prior experience in                       science centers or other science-related institutions, that                     will allow them to serve as models for participants in the                      other two categories in the program.  Their component of the                    program will span two full years.  The second program                           category is for 10 post-baccalaureate minority individuals                      who are just entering the job market and who, with the                          proper training and support, are likely to pursue a career                      in science museums.  They will participate in an 18 month                       program that will provide them with both specific career                        skills as well as an overall introduction to careers in the                     museum context.  The third program category will provide                        half-time internships for two cohorts of 20 minority                            individuals who are currently enrolled in college.  Each                        cohort will participate.  The total cost of the project is                      $2,041,485.00.  The National Science Foundation is asked to                     provide $1,051,298.00 and the members of the consortium will                    fund $990,187.00.  The cost to the National Science                             Foundation, approximately fifty percent of the project cost,                    is about $8600.00 per minority participant per year.",
