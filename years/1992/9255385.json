The conference will highlight the efforts of the National                       Science Foundation to strenghten science, mathematics and                       engineering education at the pre-college, undergraduate and                     graduate levels.  Small working sessions will allow                             professional educators from a broad range of institutions in                    the New York metroplitan area to discuss with the NSF staff the                 adequacy of existing programs and to discuss ideas for future                   programs that focus on such issues as recruitment and retention                 of minorities and preparation of mathematics and science                        teachers.",
