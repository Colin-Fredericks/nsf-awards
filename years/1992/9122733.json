 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves an in-depth investigation of the American                public's perceptions of an feelings toward Congress.  Popular                   accounts frequently stress the public's unhappiness with Congress,              but the sources of this unhappines and variations across the                    population in levels of unhappiness are seldom analyzed with                    care.  Given the importance of public attitudes toward political                institutions like Congress, and given the potential for unhappiness             to be translated into reforms with serious implications, such as                term limitations, it is essential that a deeper systematic                      appreciation of of public sentiments is obtained.                                                                                                               In this research investigation, the researchers employ both a                   national telephone survey and intensive focus group interviews to               probe systematically the nature of the American public's beliefs                about Congress; beliefs such as what the institution should be                  doing, what it is doing, and whether reforms are needed to bring                expectations and reality into line.  As such, this research                     provides a unique social science data base on perceptions of                    Congress and its members.  Analysis of these data helps to lay the              foundation for a theory of public attitudes toward, not just                    Congress, but political institutions generally.",
