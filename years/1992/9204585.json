 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will have three major impacts: (1) Add new                 algorithms and methodologies to the repertoire of computational                 geometry techniques, including new approximation methods and new                algorithms that are simpler and easier to implement than existing               ones; (2) Formulate precise algorithmic versions of a large body of             geometric problems from allied fields, in such a way that the methods           of computational geometry can be applied successfully and so that the           community of largely theoretical computational geometers can be                 properly exposed to the more practical applications of the field                (allied fields include cartography, computer vision, computer-aided             design, graphics, manufacturing, etc); and (3) Disseminate                      methodologies of computational geometry to applied researchers who              work in allied fields but who have been largely unaware of progress in          computational geometry, particularly since it has been construed as a           primarily theoretical instrument.  This third impact will be made               through discussions of research directions with contacts in industrial          research labs and through publishing papers for conferences and in              journals whose readership includes a breadth of engineering                     disciplines.",
