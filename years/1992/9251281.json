 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide partial funding to equip a teaching                   laboratory with 14 workstations for twelve students and two                     instructors.  The project will provide for a number of                          improvements in the curriculum:  1) The courses in the                          curriculum for majors will be taught in an interactive, hands-                  on, doing instead of listening manner.  Laboratory sessions                     will provide for more one on one time with professors and                       knowledgeable proctors; 2) The curriculum will become more real                 world.  The students will do their learning in a production                     type environment using state-of-the-art software engineering                    and development tools.  The environment includes UNIX  and X-                   Windows based tools; 3) The computer learning environment will                  become more graphical.  The students will be able to better                     learn about program execution and structure because of                          graphical tools that trace execution, that measure execution,                   and show the structure of programs and systems of programs; 4)                  The project will allow for group learning managed by the                        instructor using the environment's revision control system and                  module library capability; and 5) The project will allow for                    presentation of the content of the curriculum along side the                    practice of the field.  This is accomplished by allowing                        students to reuse their own previously developed programs,                      techniques, and experiences in a software environment in later                  courses in the curriculum thereby reinforcing the usefulness                    and importance of their previous work and courses.",
