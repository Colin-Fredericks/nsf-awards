These projects will include: (1) Investigation of the                   mechanism and kinetics of formation of sulfur gases and                         hydrogen chloride during combustion and gasification of spent                   pulping liquors and other biomass-containing process wastes;                    (2) Studies of the mechanism and kinetics of formation of                       nitrogen oxides during combustion of spent pulping liquors and                  other biomass-containing process wastes; and, (3)                               Investigation of the kinetics of gasification of biomass                        materials including spent pulping liquors, biomass-containing                   process wastes, wheat straw, and wood waste, including studies                  of the formation of such acid gases as sulfur dioxide and                       hydrogen chloride during gasification.                                                                                                                          The research program in combustion and gasification is                          directed at minimizing the environmental impact of combustion                   processes through in-process control and at improved energy                     conversion efficiency and energy recovery from low-grade non-                   conventional fuels and process wastes.  Thus, the program has                   the potential to aid in three national-need areas: reduction                    of air pollution, improved resource utilization, and reduction                  of solid and liquid waste disposal problems.",
