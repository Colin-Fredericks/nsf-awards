 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on analytical and numerical aspects               of inverse problems for partial differential equations, and in                  particular:  1) inverse \"source\" problems for semilinear elliptic               equations, and 2) inverse \"coefficient\" problems for linear                     elliptic equations with spatially varying coefficients.  The data               used for reconstruction in both cases consists of overdetermined                (Dirichlet or Neumann) boundary data.  The analytical component                 of the work concerns such questions as identifiability and                      continuous dependence.  For the inverse \"source problem\", the PI                furthermore will investigate the relation to the well known                     Schiffer (or Pompeiu) conjecture; for the inverse \"coefficient\"                 problem the PI will continue his investigation of bounds as well                as the relation between the isotropic and aniostropic cases. The                numerical work will be devoted to the design of effective                       reconstruction methods which to the largest extent possible rely                on structural information about the solutions of the underlying                 PDE.                                                                                 The research has direct applications to several important                  practical problems, for instance:  1) the interpretation of                     magnetic diagnostics for Tokamak (fusion) devices,  2) medical                  impedance imaging, and 3) nondestructive testing of mechanical                  parts.  Part of the research is concerned with determining the                  sufficiency of the proposed boundary data for the various                       reconstructions (proving uniqueness and continuous dependence                   results).  Another part of the research involves the design of                  effective algorithms, for instance for the detection and location               of cracks using real experimental data.  There will be an active                involvement of post-doctoral researchers as well graduate                       students and hopefully even some advanced undergraduate students                in various aspects of the research.",
