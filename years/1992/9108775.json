The selected research areas:  (1)                           Development of a Marine Biotechnology Center: Molecular                         Regulation of Biotic Interactions, Response, and Production;                    (2) Molecular Biology of Parasites Group; (3) Research in                       Cellular and Molecular Mechanism of Nervous System                              Regeneration Group; (4) Computational Mathematics Group; (5)                    Development of an Engineering Infrastructure Research Center;                   (6) Development of a Materials Research Center; and (7)                         Development of an Interdisciplinary Group of Research on Metal                  Clusters: Their Structure, Bonding, and Reactivity.  Each of                    the projects have identified short, intermediate, and long                      range goals (up to the year 2000) and devised strategies to:                    achieve national and international levels of excellence;                        strengthen human resources in S&E, including the development                    of two new Ph.D.s, and provide for the involvement of four-                     year institutions faculty and students in their research                        project; create advisory councils of distinguished researchers                  to guide project development; establish collaborative                           agreement with national and international groups and                            laboratories; and vigorously seek additional funds to build                     on the base provided by EPSCoR.  Collaborative agreements have                  been made with the Industry/University/Research Center                          (INDUNIV), the Corporation for the Technological Development                    of Tropical Resources (TROPICO), and the Puerto Rico                            Scientific Community Council (SCC) to promote and advocate for                  the strengthening of the S&E community and the development of                   R&D in the private and government sectors.  Institutional                       commitments to EPSCoR include, $4.5 million contributed by                      UPR from Commonwealth funds, a waiver of indirect cost                          amounting to $2.1 million; as well as commitments to                            incrementally hire 35 new tenure-track S&E researchers.  From                   the private sector $900,000 from TROPICO, and $45,00 from                       INDUNIV were secured to contribute to EPSCoR efforts.",
