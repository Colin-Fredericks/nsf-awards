 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first of a three year continuing award.  The                        increasing size and decreasing cost of semiconductor memory has                 prompted research into databases which are memory resident.                     These Main Memory DataBase (MMDB) systems are aimed at high                     throughput applications such as airline reservation systems,                    phone switching databases, and other real time systems where the                availability of the memory resident data is crucial.  To achieve                this high availability with volatile RAM requires a backup                      archive database on disk as well as efficient algorithms to                     checkpoint the database to the archive and to recover it from the               archive to main memory after a system failure.  It has been shown               that MMDB systems often perform better with deferred update                     techniques where data to be updated is first placed in a special                nonvolatile shadow area and only at transaction commit time is                  placed in main memory.  The authors are investigating both                      checkpointing and reloading of MMDB databases with the use of                   more conventional immediate update (IU) techniques as well as                   deferred update (DU) strategies.  The best checkpointing                        approaches are to be determined as are partial reloading                        strategies.  A partial reload allows the database to be brought                 online after a system failure faster because not all of the MMDB                is reloaded prior to bringing the system up.  This research                     represents the first examination of techniques for partial                      reloading of MMDB systems.  Due to the volatility of RAM, the                   high throughput needs of MMDB applications, and the potential for               partial reloading to dramatically increase the uptime of database               systems, the results and impact of this research are both                       widespread and significant.",
