The meeting will be chaired by Dr. Bertil Hille of the                          University of Washington and Academician Platon Kostyuk of                      the Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology in Kiev.  The                            workshop will bring together scientists working at the                          forefront of research in the area of biological membranes.                      Specific subjects to be addressed are:  biophysical and                         structural analysis of ion permeation and channel gating,                       calcium channels and their regulation through G-protein-                        coupled receptors; fast, ligand-gated channels of fast                          chemical synapses and sensory receptors; and broader cell                       biological approaches to neurosecretion and learning.                                                                                                           This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the United States and the Russia to combine complementary                       efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual                              interest and competence in the field of basic scientific                        research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and                             mutuality of benefit.",
