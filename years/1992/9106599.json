 "awd_abstract_narration": "An experimental research program will be undertaken                             to realize in the laboratory the process of photon                              duplication, a novel process in which the photon                                statistics of an input beam of light is duplicated into                         two output beams, one of which can be measured                                  while leaving the other for further manipulation.                               This process is of interest from a number of                                    standpoints that are both fundamental and applied.                              Fundamentally, photon duplication is a phenomenon                               that has never been observed; it requires quantum-                              optic experimentation in a regime that has never                                been explored.  It also leads to novel quantum                                  nondemolition detection strategies that are efficient                           and do not require largepump power or explicit                                  phase-sensitive measurements.  From an applied                                  standpoint, a photon duplicator can be used in a                                communication network as a transparent optical tap.                             Specifically, we propose to analyze the detailed                                physics of photon duplication and to perform an                                 experiment that will demonstrate the process.  A                                four-wave mixing experiment will be carried out in a                            regime where photon duplication is predicted to                                 occur.  A platelet of CdTe, pumped by a mode-                                   locked and Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, will be used as                             the nonlinear medium.  CdTe is chosen because it                                has been shown to have a large third-order                                      nonlinearity with a sub-nanosecond response time.                               Photon correlations will be measured using a novel                              pulsed shot-noise detection scheme that we have                                 developed.  In addition, we will investigate avenues                            toward implementation of the process of photon                                  duplication in nonlinear optical waveguides.",
