Frederick and                               members of his research group at Oregon State                                   University to collaborate in chemical engineering                               research with two groups of engineers from Finland.                             The objectives of their cooperative research are to                             provide basic experimental data and fundamental models                          for the processes involved in sodium aerosol formation                          and deposition and also sulfur volatilization and                               capture in the combustion and gasification of high                              sodium and/or sulfur content fuels.  Their research                             plan links the complementary expertise and                                      experimental capabilities of three research groups: 1)                          Dr. Frederick's group in the Chemical Engineering                               Department of Oregon State University, with expertise                           in rate processes and combustion of high sulfur/sodium                          fuels; 2) the Combustion Chemistry Group led by Dr. M.                          M. Hupa at the Abo Academy University, in Turku,                                Finland, which offers expertise in combustion                                   chemistry; and 3) the Aerosol Technology Group of the                           Technical Research Center of Finland, in Espoo, led by                          E. I. Kauppinen, which brings particularly strong                               theoretical and experimental capabilities in aerosol                            science.                                                                                                                                                        The high sodium and sulfur content fuels being studied                          in this project are of industrial importance to both                            the U.S. and Finland.  This is reflected in the                                 development of fluidized bed and pressurized                                    gasification processes for coal and spent pulping                               liquors in both countries.  The results of the                                  proposed research are expected to be useful in the                              design of new processes such as pressurized                                     gasification of high-sulfur coals or spent pulping                              liquors as well as in the optimization of existing                              technologies.",
