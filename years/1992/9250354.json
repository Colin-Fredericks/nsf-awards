 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops an undergraduate course in reactor                        concepts utilized in most environmental engineering processes,                  and demonstrates these principles using advanced laboratory                     methods.  The environmental engineering field is currently                      undergoing dramatic increases in the demand for engineers with                  the sophistication to design treatment processes and implement                  site remediation strategies.  These increases have resulted                     from the promulgation of federal standards for the remediation                  of contaminated sites and the removal of trace concentrations                   of hazardous compounds from water supplies.  Improvements in                    environmental engineering education to meet these challenges                    has lagged behind the increased sophistication in environmental                 engineering technology.  The objective of this project is to                    provide students with a more diverse environmental engineering                  background through the development of the course and its                        laboratory component.  Specifically, an Ion Chromatography                      System, pH/Ion Selective Electrode Meters and an Atomic                         Absorption Spectrophotometer are being incorporated into the                    laboratory to address this issue.",
