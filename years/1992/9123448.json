 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the dynamics of matrix                     differential equations and their applications.  The equations are               cast in a fairly general framework, generalizing special                        instances found in some important numerical algorithms.  The                    dynamics of each matrix differential equation will be explored                  via computer experiments, high resolution graphics and symbolic                 manipulations, in conjunction with analysis.  The objective is to               better understand the dynamics of matrix differential equations,                and to study the closely related questions regarding the                        eigenvalues and singular values of specially structured matrices.                    This study is expected to find important applications                      ranging from development of novel computational algorithms to                   theoretic solutions of new problems in differential equations and               linear algebra.",
