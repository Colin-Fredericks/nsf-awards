 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to support a study of the mechanisms               that regulate the concentration of the intracellular osmolyte,                  glycine betaine, in response to hyperosmotic stress. Glycine                    betaine is an extremely common and important osmolyte in a wide                 variety of species ranging from bacteria to plants and animals.                 Although a great deal is known about the salinity induced                       regulation of glycine betaine in bacteria, far less is known about              its regulation in plants and even less in animals. We have found                that oysters (Cassostrea virginica) from the Atlantic coast utilize             substantial amounts of glycine betaine to regulate intracellular                osmotic concentrations following hyperosmotic stress. Conspecific               oysters from the Chesapeake Bay have much smaller levels of glycine             betaine that do not change following high salinity stress, and the              Bay oysters are not as salinity tolerant. Since the mitochondrion               is usually the site of  glycine betaine synthesis, these results                suggest that these two populations of oysters differ at the                     mitochondrial level. This proposal contains experiments designed                to test that possibility by comparing several aspects of the                    mechanism of salinity induced glycine betaine synthesis between the             Bay and Atlantic oysters. The results will contribute a great deal              to the understanding of glycine betaine regulation and, in                      addition, should resolve whether the differences between the oyster             populations are genetic or environmentally founded.",
