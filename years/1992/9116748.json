This type of disorder is usually created in                          heterostructures with large spacer width by randomly distributed                remote impurity ions.  Screening by the two-dimensional electron                liquid competes effectively with the resultant random potential.                However, in some cases this screening is not effective and the two-             dimensional electron liquid becomes very inhomogeneous.  In a                   strong magnetic field this state occurs each time the filling                   factor of the Landau level corresponds to an integer or a                       fractional gap.  Different manifestations of the inhomogeneous                  state will be studied: the low temperature behavior of the                      conductivity tensor in the filling factor range where all gaps are              destroyed by disorder; the width of the plateau of the quantum Hall             effect; the attenuation of the surface acoustic waves; the Wigner               crystal formation in the presence of the long range disorder.                   %%%                                                                             Theoretical studies will be made on the physics of mesoscopic                   systems where quantum effects are manifest on a macroscopic scale.              In particular, studies will be made on the effects of disorder on               the properties of the two-dimensional electron liquid which forms               at junctions between semiconductors.",
