 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, MS. Marcia-Anne Dobres                will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will examine               bone and antler artifacts from 16 archaeological sites from the                 Pyrenees region of France which date from the end of the last Ice               Age. This wide variety of artifacts include tool types such as                  harpoons, needles, points and spear throwers. On a macro level she              will describe the formal attributes of these tools: their size and              conformation. Using microscopic techniques she will also attempt to             reconstruct the processes by which they were made. Through study of             resharpening and breakage she should be able to trace the                       functional history of individual objects. By comparison of                      sequential levels within a single site as well as roughly                       synchronic assemblages between sites she will attempt to set the                use of these objects into a broader regional perspective and show               how this pattern changed over time.                                                                                                                             The cultural achievements of Magdalenian and related peoples set                the stage for the emergence of complex societies. The Magdalenians              are responsible for the magnificent cave paintings in Southern                  France and adjacent regions of Spain. They developed specialized                subsistence economies which focussed on seasonal resources such as              salmon and they fabricated finely made bone objects. While many                 Magdalenian sites have been excavated no reseacher has looked in                detail at bone working from a cross-site perspective. The goal of               this work is not to understand bone working per se but rather use               indicators such as variation in form and manufacturing technique to             gain insight into Magdalenian social, subsistence and technological             organization.                                                                                                                                                   This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed light on the              emergence of complex societies and will assist in the training of               an extremely promising student.",
