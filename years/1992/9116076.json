 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in              condensed matter physics between Jean Toulouse of Lehigh                        University and Michel Rousseau, University of Maine in LeMans,                  France.  The investigators will study structural phase transitions              fluorides with perovskite structure.  The objectives of their                   collaboration are to investigate the physical mechanism involved in             structural phase transitions (SPT) and to understand the properties             of these materials during the phase transitions.  The Lehigh group              brings to this collaboration a solid background in defect studies and           experience in ultrasonic, dielectric and spectroscopic experimental             techniques.  This is complemented by the French investigators                   expertise in neutron scattering and x-ray studies and their ability to          grow high quality crystals.                                                                                                                                     Structural phase transition in mixed systems, especially oxides, is             an area of considerable current interest.  Mixed systems are                    important to the development of high Tc superconductors, optical                materials and structural materials.  Further knowledge about the                effects of structural phase transition on the composition of materials          could lead to the development of improved, high performance                     materials.",
