 "awd_abstract_narration": "Escherichia coli transcription termination protein rho employs                  an RNA-dependent ATPase activity to effect transcript release                   from paused transcription complexes.  The PI is studying the                    molecular mechanism of the rho ATPase reaction using                            enzymological, biochemical, and molecular biological                            techniques, in order to understand its role in transcription                    termination.  The knowledge gained will prove useful to the                     broader question of RNA-protein interactions and to the                         understanding of energy-transducing ATPases.  In the present                    proposal, studies of rho ATPase activity are continued, and an                  investigation of rho-RNA interactions is begun.  RHO is thought                 to use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move with respect to the                 RNA chain of transcription complexes.  Rho binds to this RNA                    and releases it from RNA polymerase and the DNA template.  The                  postulated mechanism for such movement is the ATP hydrolysis-                   dependent binding and release of the nascent RNA.  From earlier                 work on rho-ATP interactions it is predicted that RNA should                    bind to rho ATP complexes much more tightly than to rho.ADP.Pi                  complexes, and an experiment had been designed to test this                     prediction.  To test whether rho uses the energy of ATP                         hydrolysis to travel with respect to RNA, Dr. Stitt and co-                     workers have developed a system to measure the amount of ATP                    hydrolyzed per RNA chain released. This system is being used in                 a normal rho-dependent release; it will also be employed in a                   system in which an insert has been made between the rho binding                 site and the end of the transcript.  If rho used ATP energy to                  travel along RNA, it should use more ATP in the system where it                 has to travel further .  The sites on rho of its interaction                    with RNA have only vaguely been localized; RNA crosslinking                     experiments will be use to better define them.  Rho shows a                     requirement for RNA to activate its ATPase activity, although                   the DNA policy (dC) binds as well to rho as the RNA-DNA                         oligonucleotides of defined sequence will be used to identify                   the locations on RNA where the 2'OH is critical for rho ATPase                  activation.",
