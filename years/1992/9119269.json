 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists are increasingly realizing that patterns of                     storage and processing of energy and chemical elements in                       ecosystems are strongly influenced by the composition of the                    ecological communities present in the ecosystem.  In lakes, the                 abundance of \"top predators\" (i.e. fish-eating fish species like                bass) can have strong effects on all levels of the system,                      including the abundance and productivity of plant producers and                 the cycling of chemical elements.  This occurs because predatory                fish consume plankton-feeding fish, like minnows, which in turn                 influence herbivorous consumers (zooplankton).  Finally,                        zooplankton both regulate the abundance of plant producers                      (phytoplankton) and decomposers (bacteria) and recycle nutrients.               This project focusses on the effects of food web structure on the               relative availability of nutrient elements critical for microbial               growth (nitrogen and phosphorus).  It tests the predictions of a                recently-developed, physiologically-based theory designed to                    understand how different zooplankton species regenerate nitrogen                and phosphorus present in their food.  By altering the dynamics                 of these herbivorous zooplankton, fish predation can therefore                  influence the cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus.  Based at the                 Experimental Lakes Area in Canada, the main research approaches                 will in involve experimental manipulations of nutrients and                     zooplankton in large enclosures in lakes as well as whole-lake                  manipulations of food-web structure (via introduction of pike to                two lakes which lack such a fish-eating species).  THese studies                have direct application to understanding the processes                          controlling elemental cycling in ecosystems; such processes play                a critical role in various areas of direct societal, including                  global climate change, the dynamics of contaminants in the                      environment, and degradation of water supplies.",
