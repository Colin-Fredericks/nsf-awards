 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mathematical work supported by this grant lies in the                  area of systems of partial differential equations.  More                        specifically, boundary value problems in domains with nonsmooth                 boundaries for elliptic and parabolic systems and higher order                  equations will be investigated.  In addition work on                            homogenization will be carried out.  One of the particular                      problems of interest involves elliptic systems of elastostatics                 and parabolic systems with boundary data in the Lebesgue spaces.                It is not known, in dimension four and greater, what range of                   power norms of boundary data will yield solutions.                                   Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them.",
