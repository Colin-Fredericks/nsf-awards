 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional welding methods with a sequentially moving,                    localized heat input, offer limited simultaneous control over the               multiple features of weld quality and productivity.  This research              will focus on the invention of a novel parallel technique, scan                 welding, implemented by fast repetitive cycling of the torch along              the weld surface to provide a regulated continuous heat                         distribution.  This new method will produce the full bead length                simultaneously, and yield longitudinally uniform thermal properties             of the weld.  The dynamics of scan welding will be studied by                   analytical and numerical modeling of its temperature, phase and                 stress-strain field.  On this basis, a distributed adaptive control             system with in-process parameter identification will be designed                to modulate the torch power and motion, so as to obtain the                     specified thermal field.  Scan welding will also be implemented on              a robotic plasma welding system with thermal feedback from an                   infrared pyrometer, and experiments will be performed for model                 verification and comparison of scan welding to conventional                     techniques.                                                                          The expected advantages include high process speed and                     efficiency, elimination of preheat and annealing requirements, and              close simultaneous control of weld bead geometry, material                      microstructure and properties, and residual stresses and                        distortions of the joint.  These benefits provide the potential for             optimization of the welding productivity and quality, especially                in critical and highly demanding applications.",
