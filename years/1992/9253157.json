 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the learning of important but                         difficult scientific knowledge in biology using hypermedia                      learning systems based on a recent cognitive theory of case-                    based learning (Spiro, Feltovich, Coulson, & Anderson, 1988;                    Spiro & Jehng, 1990).  This approach to structuring                             hypertext and hypermedia systems provides a multidimension                      and nonlinear learning environment that explicitly                              demonstrates critical conceptual interrelationships in the                      instructional content.  The system has been tested in a                         number of different domains, such as biomedicine and                            military strategy (Spiro et al., 1988).  There have also                        been promising findings of knowledge transfer in a                              controlled experimental setting using a hypertext system of                     this type (Jacobson & Spiro, 1991).                                                                                                                             The proposed research represents the first application in                       biology classroom settings of this theory-based approach to                     structuring hypermedia learning technologies.  Scientists                       will validate the accuracy and currency of the biology                          content and practicing biology teachers will explore ways in                    which these hypermedia systems can be best integrated in                        real-world classroom settings.  These new instructional                         systems will be tested in public high school biology and                        life sciences courses with a wide range of students spanning                    from academically talented to underserved populations                           comprised of low income, minority, or academically low                          performing students.  These hypermedia learning systems are                     expected to help these different types of students both to                      learn difficult biology concepts and to be able to use their                    acquired knowledgen in new ways and in new situations.  This                    collaborative university-school research project will                           explore a number of issues related to the acquisition and                       transfer of biological knoweledge, cognitive learning                           theory, hypermedia instructional design, and the integration                    of hypermedia learning systems into the overall school-based                    science learning environment.",
