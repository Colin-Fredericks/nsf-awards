 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-term evolutionary adaptation to temperature will be measured               experimentally in the bacterium Escherichia coli.  Originally the               founding experimental line (the ancestor) was maintained at 37 C.               Subsequently, groups of replicated lines were obtained after 2000               generations of exposure to 32 C, 42 C, and a daily alternation                  between them, as well as control lines which were maintained at 37              C.  These experiments will determine the mechanisms by which each               of these groups adapted to their respective temperatures.  Measured             variables will include changes in synthetic and transport                       capacities, stress resistance, and population growth performance.               Lines will also be selected at higher (>42 C) temperatures to                   determine whether the upper thermal limit can be extended and the               correlated changes responsible for increased temperature tolerance.             The research proposes to address the following questions: --How                 rapidly can biological systems respond evolutionarily to                        environmental change? --Does prior evolutionary history in one                  environment condition or predispose ability to adapt to novel                   environments? --Does adaptation to a particular environment proceed             by similar mechanisms or are there as many solutions as adaptive                events?  Specific issues addressed by this research include the                 rate and limits of adaptation in diverse thermal environments, the              extent of trade-offs during adaptive evolution, the effect of                   historical environment on further adaptation, the concordance of                mechanistic adaptations during evolution in similar environments,               and environmental effects on mutational processes.",
