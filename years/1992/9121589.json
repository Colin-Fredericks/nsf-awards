Early                       transition metal metallocene-mediated, electrocatalytic oxygen                  atom transfer reactions will be studied. The goal of the                        research will be to develop electrocatalytic oxidation                          reactions by electrochemically, photochemically and chemically                  generating highly reactive organometallic species bound to a                    polymer support for use as oxygen atom transfer catalysts.                      Oxygen atom sources will be carbon dioxide and water and                        typical substrates will be olefins. Expected products will be                   epoxides and ketones. Catalyst species will be site-isolated on                 supported surfaces and spectroscopically characterized.                         Individual steps in the catalytic cycle will be defined by                      infrared and ESR spectroscopy.                                                  %%%                                                                             Catalytic oxygen atom transfer reactions are of great                           commercial importance. The epoxidation of olefins is currently                  carried out on a large scale. New, more efficient catalysts                     could have a major impact both on commercial technology as well                 as on understanding fundamental oxidation mechanisms.",
