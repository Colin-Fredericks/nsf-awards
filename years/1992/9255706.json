Student science training programs are designed to provide students              with educational opportunities in science, engineering, and                     mathematics beyond those normally available in course or laboratory             work in the students' schools.  The primary means of accomplishing              this is by bringing students into contact with the instructional                staff, research personel, and general resources of colleges,                    universities, and research institutions (private, industrial, and               governmental).                                                                                                                                                  In addition to publishing the \"Directory,\" Science Service conducts             an annual conference bringing directors of such programs together               so they can exchange ideas.  Each year many people aspiring to                  direct such programs attend and start their own programs in                     subsequent years.",
