 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will continue on parallel programs in stochastic                  geometry and stochastic Lyapunov stability theory.  In the former               direction research will involve the recurrence of isotropic                     transport processes and a project on eigenfunction expansions,                  both in the context of Riemannian manifolds.  The work on                       Lyapunov stability will investigate nonlinear oscillations and                  wave equations with boundary conditions.  Continued support is                  also being provided for the Midwest Probability Colloquium, which               now functions as a major annual event in the field of probability               theory.                                                                              Mathematical research in probability theory is used as a                   tool for modeling in both the physical and social sciences.  This               award will continue the development of these tools.  In addition                it will provide support for a meeting which has been very                       successful in bringing together research workers from many                      specialty areas.",
