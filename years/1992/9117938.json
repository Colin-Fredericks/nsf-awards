 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surface growth is a key feature of bacterial action in nature.  The             E. coli colony is an excellent model system of bacterial surface                populations.  It is a highly organized structure characterized by               differential gene expression.  Cell-cell interactions over                      distances of microns regulate the growth of individuals cells, and              gene expression patterns can be coordinated between populations                 separated by distances of millimeters.  Diffusible signals affect               several aspects of colony development. Genetic loci subject                     differential control during colony development have been identified             by spontaneous and transposon insertion mutations and the use of                lacZ fusions.  In addition, the cAMP system has been implicated in              activating the spatially localized replication of Mudiac elements.              The experimental program will extend these initial observations by              detailed study of three systems:(1) developmental regulation of the             dev1891::lacZ fusion.  (2) the role of DNA polymerase 1, the cAMP               system, and diffusible substances in the control of Mudiac                      replication, and (3) the dev2137 and dev2137 mutations located in               the oriC region of the chromosome.  The results will specify gene               products involved in colony morphogenesis, provide a more detailed              picture of differential gene expression during growth on an agar                surface, and identify diffusible signals that affect colony                     developments.",
