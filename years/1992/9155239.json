 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clark County School District(CCSD) will provide staff                           development for elementary teachers (72 in mathematics, 72 in                   science) and administrators to become leaders and agents of                     change. By means of this systematic plan to empower educators                   an opportunity will be created for every K-6 grade student to                   become an active learner and scientifically and mathematically                  literate.                                                                                                                                                       The participants are well prepared teachers who are                             knowledgeable about content and conversant with current                         instructional strategies on how children learn mathematics and                  science.                                                                                                                                                        The staff for the project include nationally recognized                         experts from the Lawrence Hall of Science(U.C Berkeley),The                     Math Learning Center(Portland State University), The Center                     for Excellence in Mathematics Education(Western Washington                      University) and TERC. The materials to be adopted stress the                    use of manipulatives and hands on learning and include Math                     and the Mind's Eye, FOSS and SAVI/SELPH.                                                                                                                        The leadership component will be patterned on the California                    Mathematics Leadership Program(CMLP) an NSF funded project                      under the leadership of Ruth Parker who will serve as a                         consultant on this project. In the third and fourth years of                    the program the participants will assume their                                  responsibilities for leadership by teaching in Staff                            Development centers throughout the school district and working                  with peer teachers in schools.                                                                                                                                  A history of the project will be maintained by the co-                          directors.  This will serve to document the process of change                   and the consequences for teachers, administrators and students                  in a large and diverse school district which includes rural,                    suburban and inner city schools. This will serve as a model                     for other districts planning similar in depth staff                             development to empower teachers as agents of change.  Cost                      sharing is equal to 94% of NSF funding requested.//",
