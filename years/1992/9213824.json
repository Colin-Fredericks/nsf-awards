 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electronic structure of two classes of novel Mott insulators will               be studied under this Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative             grant: the crown-ether electrides and the layered transition metal              oxides.  Although these oxides are believed to be traditional Mott              insulators explained by the Hubbard model, in fact the ground state             of that model disagrees seriously with experimental Bragg neutron               scattering.  The assumptions of this model will be examined with                the objective of finding an appropriate replacement that will                   describe the observed spin density as well as the excited states.               A novel feature of the crown-ether electrides is that the anions                are simply the localized electrons themselves.  Calculations on                 isolated crown-ether molecules suggests that the localized                      electrons will trace their lineage to a highly diffuse Rydberg-like             orbital occupied by the unpaired electron.  The diffuse character               of these molecular electrons may permit them to become localized in             the cavities formed \"between\" the molecular ions.  This                         proposition, as well as the spatial distribution of the ordered                 magnetic moment in the transition metal oxides, will be explored                using ab initio Hartree-Fock theory as well as multi-band Hubbard               models using both variational and perturbation methods.                         %%%                                                                             Theoretical research will be conducted as part of the Materials                 Synthesis and Processing Initiative.  The primary focus will be on              a theoretical explanation of a new class of electride materials -               the crown-ethers.  These materials have been synthesized at                     Michigan State and a firm theoretical explanation is required.  In              addition, research will be conducted on a related material, the                 transition metal oxides, which is important as the precursor                    material for high temperature superconductors.",
