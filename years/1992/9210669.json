 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project develops a better understanding of competitive                      strategies of multiproduct firms in the specific context of                     retailers.  The research will involve both theoretical and                      empirical analysis of competitive strategies.  The theory relies                on a game theoretic framework with an important feature often                   absent in such cases.  Consumer decisions are endogenous to the                 theoretical model, and are predicated on information provided by                firms.  Where information is lacking, consumers have expectations               which are fulfilled in equilibrium, i.e., rational expectations.                Empirical work spans an examination of supermarket pricing and                  advertising strategies over a long time, and a study of consumer                patronage of supermarkets in the same market.  Thus, the                        empirical study follows the theory which treats both firms' and                 consumers' decisions as endogenous.  The empirical study provides               insights into specific institutional mechanisms.  However, the                  model is general, thus providing insights into the phenomena of                 multiproduct firms and multifaceted competition which are                       becoming increasingly important.  Finally, the research will move               marketing science away from its focus on a single brand to the                  case of multiproduct firms with multiple strategic options.",
