 "awd_abstract_narration": "There have been and continue to be a remarkable number of cases                 in which high-wage and low-wage countries have become partially                 integrated.  The increasing economic interdependence of the U.S.                and Japan beginning in the 1950's is one example.  The high-wage                European community has added Ireland, Spain, Greece and Portugal.               More recently there is the integration of West and East Germany;                and of Western and Eastern Europe generally.  Also there is the                 increasing integration of the U.S. and Mexico and the partial                   integration of the U.S. with the rest of Latin America.  This                   project studies theoretically and empirically the consequences of               partial economic integration of high-wage and low-wage countries.               The goal is to understand what happens to output mix, factor                    returns, employment, unemployment, and prices as two or more                    regions with different wages are partially or fully integrated.                                                                                                 One contribution of this research will be an assessment of the                  value of competing models as vehicles for understanding partial                 economic integration.  A variety of different economic models                   will be considered, differing in terms of their assumptions                     regarding the degree of factor mobility between industries and                  between countries, the nature of the production process and the                 character of competition in goods and factor markets.  Another                  contribution of this project will be the assessment of the impact               of various policy measures on the performance of an economy in                  the midst of an integration episode.  The possible policy                       measures include isolationist commercial policy, industrial                     subsidies, unemployment compensation, adjustment assistance, and                educational subsidies.",
