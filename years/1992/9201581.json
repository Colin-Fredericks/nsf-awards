 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main purpose of this research project is to understand                 the interactions in multiple space dimensions of nonlinear fluid                waves.  Shock waves, turbulent mixing zones, flame fronts,                      solidification fronts, and fluid and material interfaces provide                examples of the types of waves considered here.  The                            investigators analyze first the regular case, in which a small                  number of waves meet at a point and propagate in a self-similar                 fashion, as a traveling wave with definite velocity and with                    definite relativeangles.  This problem is related to, but more                  difficult than, the one-dimensional Riemann problem, with which                 the investigators and coworkers have prior experience.  Secondly,               they consider the case of chaotic higher dimensional wave                       interactions, characterized by unstable interfaces, mixing                      regions, and sensitive dependence on initial conditions.  In this               chaotic case, they identify elementary modes, which interact to                 form an effective statistical ensemble.  The study of the chaotic               case depends upon the renormalization group, and methods to                     reduce the number of effective degrees of freedom.  Fixed points                of the renormalization group found by the investigators and                     coworkers to characterize chaotic mixing regimes suggest                        directions for research.                                                        One of the most difficult aspects of the study of wave                          propagation is the computation of nonlinear wave interactions.                  This project is to study the mathematical structure of such                     interactions and to use this analysis to improve computer                       programs that model flows where wave interactions are important.                Flows of this type occur in a wide variety of industrial,                       military, and scientific applications, including supersonic                     flight, sheet metal forming and die pressing, weather prediction,               fluid turbulence, projectile penetration of armor, blast waves,                 and astrophysics.  All of these areas are characterized by                      sensitive dependence on the detailed structures produced by the                 nonlinear interaction of waves, and thus share many common                      mathematical aspects.  Knowledge gained in studying the abstract                properties of wave interactions can be applied to all of these                  areas, and will lead to improved computer simulations and a                     better understanding of the processes occurring during strong                   wave interactions.",
