The P.I. will                                              attempt to show that by using the                                               tools of interior point methods, a                                              neural network algorithm such as                                                back propagation can be improved                                                both in learning time and quality                                               of solution by optimizing the given                                             methods of learning.  As an                                                     introductory study, this proposal                                               will investigate the effects on                                                 learning in BP by studying a method                                             of analytical centers (Huard 1967,                                              Sonnevend 1985, Renegar 1989). A                                                similar approach was developed and                                              investigated by Trafalis (1989),                                                Abhyankar, Morin and Trafalis                                                   (1990) for multiobjective                                                       optimization problems.

The findings of the research will                                               then be generalized to cover more                                               general activation functions (e.g.                                              sigmoid functions); (2) To design,                                              implement and computationally test                                              the learning algorithms which were                                              developed in phase one of the                                                   research; (3) To test the developed                                             learning laws in vision problems                                                related to medical applications in                                              cancer diagnosis.",
