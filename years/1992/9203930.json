 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this mathematical research is the analysis of                certain singular integral transforms and their mapping properties               relative to various spaces of functions.  In particular, work                   will be done to establishing the boundedness of such mappings in                those cases where the kernel of the singular integral lacks the                 smoothness necessary to be treated by classical techniques.                     These include multilinear singular integrals called d-commutators               and operators which fail to carry the Hardy space into integrable               functions or bounded functions into BMO.  Some progress has                     already been made.  For example, a result similar to the now                    standard David-Journe T1-condition has been developed which                     permits consideration of very rough kernels.  The work also lends               itself to the consideration of commutators of singular integrals                with mixed homogeneity, in particular parabolic homogeneity.                         Singular integral transformations form the basis for much of               the important work under active consideration in modern harmonic                analysis.  Among the motivating forces behind these studies is                  the goal for finding comprehensive techniques for solving broad                 classes of partial differential equations.  These equations arise               as models of many important, nonlinear physical phenomena.",
