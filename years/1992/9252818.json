 "awd_abstract_narration": "MESA's Success Through Collaboration program expands to                         offer a science and mathematics summer camp for 40 American                     Indian middle school students from throughout California per                    year.  Held on the California Polytechnic University campus                     in San Luis Obispo and centering on an environmental theme,                     the camp is designed to:  develop a community of                                academically oriented rural and urban Indian students;                          excite students about science, mathematics and engineering                      and the career possibilities in those fields; bolster self-                     esteem; demonstrate the leadership training; increase                           critical thinking and communications skills; and deepen                         students' commitment to remain in school and obtain a                           college degree in science, mathematics or engineering.  The                     instructional approach includes cultural activities imbedded                    in an interdisciplinary environmental curriculum of hands-on                    mathematics and science and is facilitated by undergraduate                     role models and small group cooperative learning.  Students                     will complete environmental projects and present them                           through a conference-like forum to parents and peers.                           Professors and practicing engineers and scientists provide                      career counseling.  Academic year follow-up includes                            activities in MESA Academies, field trips, and guest                            speakers and MESA Clubs.  Camp graduates subsequently become                    members AISES and interact with AISES university student                        mentors.",
