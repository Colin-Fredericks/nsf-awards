 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the              molecular mechanisms by which nucleotide sugars are transported                 across intracellular membranes and how such transport systems                   regulate glycoconjugate biosynthesis in mammalian cells.  The                   proposed research will focus on determining how uridine nucleotide              sugars are transported across the Golgi apparatus membrane.  UDP-               galactose transport across the Golgi membrane will be characterized             using Golgi vesicles isolated from rat liver.  This                             characterization will include determination of the kinetic                      constants and driving force for UDP-galactose transport.  The UDP-              N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-galactose transporters will be                      solubilized and reconstituted into liposomes, as a first step                   toward the ultimate purification of these transporter proteins.  A              cDNA encoding for the UDP-galactose transporter will be isolated                utilizing an expression cloning strategy to clone by                            complementation analysis using a chinese hamster ovary cell mutant              which is defective in UDP-galactose transport.                                  %%%                                                                             Glycoconjugates, including glycoproteins and glycolipids, are                   critical to the life of all cells.  They are synthesized by the                 stepwise addition of covalently linked simple sugars to nascent                 structures (proteins or lipids).  These reactions generally proceed             by the transfer of the sugar moiety from a biosynthetic activated               precursor, or nucleotide-sugar, to the nascent glycoconjugate.  In              eukaryotes, these glycosyltransfer reactions usually take place                 within the lumens of intracellular membrane-bounded compartments                (e.g. endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus).  Most nucleotide              sugars (e.g., UDP-galactose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) are                       synthesized in the cytosol, and because of their ionic charge,                  cannot passively diffuse across a biological membrane.  Therefore,              specific transporters exist in the intracellular membranes which                effect the translocation of the nucleotide sugar precursors from                the cytosol into the lumen.  This project focuses on the transport              of UDP-galactose across the Golgi apparatus membrane, and in                    particular on the biochemical description of the membrane                       transporter.  The work will lead to the eventual understanding of               how this class of transport protein operates, and also will further             our understanding of the functions and organization of the Golgi                apparatus, a subcellular organelle which plays a central role in                protein sorting and secretion, and in the biosynthesis of                       glycoproteins and glycolipids.  The results of these studies may                have practical application in engineering cells to produce various              specific glycoconjugates on a commercial scale.",
