 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                        Chemistry Division, Gilbert will investigate the spectroscopy                   and photochemistry of various nitrogen-containing compounds,                    such as energetic halogen amines, aminyl radicals, and                          nitrenes.  NX2, NXY, and NX species will be trapped in low                      temperature matrices for spectroscopic and photochemical                        characterization, while the photochemistry of several NX3 and                   NX2Y species will be studied in the gas phase.  Ultraviolet/                    visible absorption and laser-induced fluorescence spectra will                  be obtained from the matrix-isolated species to characterize                    their electronic states as well as to aid in understanding the                  photodissociation dynamics of the gas-phase amines and their                    intermediates.                                                                  %%%                                                                             The family of nitrogen-containing compounds known as halogen                    amines is interesting because these compounds are notoriously                   unstable under standard conditions of temperature and                           pressure.  The reasons for this behavior are not understood,                    but certain trends are observed, such as increasing                             instability in going from compounds containing fluorine to                      those containing chlorine, bromine, and finally iodine.  An                     understanding of these issues in the halogen amines may aid in                  elucidating the chemical nature of other nitrogen-bearing                       species.",
