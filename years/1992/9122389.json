 "awd_abstract_narration": "The political transformation of the Soviet Union from an                        authoritarian to an increasingly participatory society                          provides a unique opportunity to examine the emergence of new                   modes of political activity during a period of state                            formation.  This study links data on political participation                    and other forms of organizational behavior from two already                     completed first stage surveys of approximately 7,000                            respondents in Estonia and 12,000 in Russia (RSFSR) with a                      second wave of more detailed interviews of approximately                        1,500 in Estonia and 3,500 in the RSFSR.  The interviews will                   explore the extent of political and organizational                              involvement.  Explanations for this involvement will be                         sought in the reasons people give for their activity, in the                    resources of time, money, and skills they have available, and                   in the networks of friends and acquaintances that get them                      involved in organizations.  Because the first interviews were                   before the August, 1991 coup attempt and the second wave will                   be in early 1992, the investigators will gather important                       data on how people's activities and attitudes changed during                    this historic period.  The end result should be a                               significantly better understanding of how political                             participation and democracy is developing in Estonia and in                     the RSFSR.",
