 "awd_abstract_narration": "An adaptive approach to qualitative modeling of physical devices                will be investigated.  The behaviors of a physical device, in this              approach, are acquired by modifying and combining structure                     behavior models of known devices and behavioral models of generic               domain mechanisms.  The structure-behavior model of a specific                  device explicitly specifies its structure, its functions, and the               internal causal behaviors that show how its structure achieves its              functions.  The behavioral model of a generic domain mechanism                  specifies its function and model of a known device is revised by                model-revision plans, where each plan accommodates a specific type              of structural or functional difference between the new and the                  known devices.  The process of model revision is focused by                     knowledge of the internal causal behaviors of the known device.                 The research will evaluate the adaptive approach to qualitative                 modeling for solving the task of design verification.  The design-              verification task is to predict whether a proposed design will                  deliver the functions desired of it.  This research will contribute             to qualitative modeling by providing a unified view of qualitative              modeling, model memory, and model learning.",
