 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of the chemical and physical consequences of                   captodative radical stabilization will be conducted for a                       series of 2-oxomorpholinyl-3-yl radical species. The extent of                  radical stabilization by captodative effects will  be                           determined by photoacoustic calorimetry and photovoltammetry.                   In addition to the characterization of the reductive properties                 of captodative radicals, their ultimate use as centers for high                 spin polymers will be assessed by synthesis of amide coupled                    oligomers and polymers. Dihydropyrazines derived from the                       oxomorpholine structures will be employed to make conductive CT                 complexes with a variety of strong electron acceptors.                          %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program suppports the                      continuing investigation by Professor T. A. Koch at the                         University of Colorado. A study of radical species stabilized                   in a unique manner by groups attached to the molecule which are                 able to push and pull electrons by virtue of the electronic                     nature will be conducted. A particular interesting part of the                  research will focus on the ability of specially designed                        molecules of this variety to form complexes with electron                       acceptor compounds which are capable of conducting electricity.                 In addition, it is proposed to utilize these radical species in                 polymers to generate materials which have unique magnetic                       properties. Such materials have potential applications in                       fabrication of electrical devices.",
