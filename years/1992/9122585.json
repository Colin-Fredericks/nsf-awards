 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fish collection housed at the Virginia Institute of Marine                  Science of the College of William and Mary provides an important                resource for taxonomic, systematic and ecological investigations of             freshwater, estuarine and marine fishes.  The uniqueness of the                 collection is in part due to its historical significance as well as             a close coupling with a strong graduate program in ichthyology.  The            collection has internationally recognized holdings of Chesapeake                Bay, middle Atlantic Bight and deep-water marine fishes, as well as             freshwater fishes of the southern Appalachians.  These collections              have provided the basis for numerous graduate research projects and             investigations by systematists from many institutions.  In addition,            rapidly expanding collections of early life history stages of fishes            from Chesapeake Bay, middle Atlantic Bight and Caribbean localities             offer an important and unique source of material for ontogenetic                studies.  The utility of the fish collection has been limited by                a lack of space to store and efficiently work with speciments, and              the lack of a curatorial staff to manage it properly.  Funds have               been committed for the construction of a new building to house the              the fish collection permanently.  This project will assist in complet-          ing storage capabilities of the new building and in relocating and              curating the collection.  Completion of the project will                        dramatically enhance this systematic resource and contribute to its             long term preservation.  The principal investigators for this work              are excellent.  The facilities and working environment provided by              the institution will be conducive to successful completion of the               efforts.  The product of the work will provide an enduring and                  valuable resource for basic biological research as well as for                  efforts in conservation biology and fishery management.",
