 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our abilities to see, hear, smell and touch are all mediated               by sensory systems in which the stimuli and the receptors are                   well understood.  For example, vision results from light entering               the eye and impinging on receptors located in the retina.  While                it is known that environmental events, such as changes in                       temperature and food availability, have major effects upon the                  behavior of mammals, little is known about the stimuli and                      receptors that mediate these influences on the brain.  Dr.                      Schneider will investigate this important problem.  She has found               that reproductive, maternal, and temperature regulatory behaviors               are controlled by the availability of metabolic energy, or the                  chemical fuels that derive from sugars and fats.  This supply of                metabolic fuels is influenced by diet, body fat stores, and the                 energy required to keep warm, find food and carry out other                     processes necessary for life.  Dr. Schneider will now identify                  the nature and location of sensory detectors of metabolic energy                availability.  She will infuse drugs that inhibit specific                      metabolic pathways to examine effects on neuroendocrine systems                 controlling each of the three specific regulatory behaviors                     mentioned above.  Her results will provide a broad and integrated               view of the relation between metabolic, neural and hormonal                     signals generated by changes in energy supply and demand.                       Moreover, these results will have important clinical relevance                  since they should shed light on phenomena such as infertility in                women who limit their energy intake.  Infertility is common in                  professional athletes, ballet dancers and women with eating                     disorders such as anorexia nervous.  It also occurs in normal                   women who diet and/or participate in recreational sports.  Dr.                  Schneider's work will help elucidate how these changes in fuel                  availability influence the nervous system to regulate behavioral                and physiological responses.",
