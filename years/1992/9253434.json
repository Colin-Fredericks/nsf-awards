 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to develop and implement an                     experiment-based hands-on program which will introduce girls in the             4th, 5th and 6th grades to the physical sciences.  The project is               a collaborative effort between the principal investigator who is a              professor of Physics at the University of Missouri and the Science              Coordinator of the Columbia Public School System.  Several topics               such as Optics, Sound, Electricity, Magnetism and Mechanics have                been selected to introduce girls to simple concepts in Physics                  through the development of games, experiments, toys, art projects               and laboratory experiments.  The project expects to motivate the                girls by conveying that science is fun, but more importantly, by                familiarizing them with scientific equipment and concepts.  The                 program is an extra-curricular activity in its initial phase.  It               is expected that the material developed will be integrated into the             regular curriculum in the future.",
