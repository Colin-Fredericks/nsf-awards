 "awd_abstract_narration": "In its many guises, harmonic measure lies at the heart of                  many deep problems arising in complex function theory, potential                theory and, of late, analytic dynamics.  The definition is                      particularly simple.  For a given domain in Euclidean space of                  any dimension, a function is defined to equal one on a given                    subset of the boundary and zero on the rest of the boundary.                    Harmonic measure is that harmonic function on the domain                        possessing these boundary values (or the value of the function at               any specified point). It is also the probability that a Brownian                path issuing from a fixed interior point first hits the boundary                in the given set.                                                                    The main theme of this research is to explore the fine                     structure of harmonic measure  on fractal boundaries  and to                    relate it, by means of fractal approximation, to certain                        stochastic properties of harmonic measure of general domains.                   This work begins a systematic study of the so-called dimension                  spectrum which describes properties of harmonic measure.  It is                 relevant to the large deviation theory in stochastic processes.                 The main topics of study are:  1. Estimates of universals bounds                for the dimension spectrum.  2. Fractal approximation theory. 3.                Properties and numerical parameters of the dimension spectrum                   for particular Julia sets and other important classes of                        fractals.",
