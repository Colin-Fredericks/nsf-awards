 "awd_abstract_narration": "The neuroendocrine mechanisms that regulate the control of                      feeding is a fundamentally important problem that is not well                   understood.  It is known that control of food consumption depends               on complex interactions between several types of neurochemicals,                including neuropeptides and steroidal hormones.  Based on                       extensive neurobiological data, Dr. Deviche hypothesizes that                   opioids interact with androgens within specific brain cells of                  the hypothalamus, an important neural structure for regulatory                  behaviors.  To test this theory, he will use a combination of                   neuroanatomical, biochemical and behavioral approaches.                         Experiments will identify the specific hypothalamic nuclei that                 opioid peptides act to influence feeding, and where these                       peptides interact with respect to testosterone, the major                       testicular androgen.  Moreover, the unique environment at the                   University of Alaska enables Dr. Deviche to utilize a seasonally                breeding, migratory avian species that undergo extreme seasonal                 changes in testosterone as his model.  He will establish the                    relationship between density of CNS opioid receptors and                        variations within plasma concentrations of this androgen.  It is                likely that these data could ultimately have significance for our               understanding of human eating disorders.  For example, anorexia                 nervosa is a life-threatening eating disorder for which there is                some evidence for opioid and endocrine dysfunctions.",
