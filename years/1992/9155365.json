 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Martin Marin is the Dean of the School of Education at                      City University of New York, and he has designed an                             innovative program for introducing atmospheric science and                      weather-prediction technology into the elementary and middle                    school curriculum in Community School Districts 5, 10, 11,                      and 25 of New York City.  The City's instructional program                      for grades 5 and 8 already includes weather as a content                        topic, and Dr. Marin's project will significantly enhance                       the teaching and learning of this subject.  Dr. Marin has                       established close ties among the University's department of                     Atmospheric Sciences and the national network of                                satellite-derived weather data.  A cadre of 12 science                          teachers from the four districts will receive two weeks of                      intensive training in atmospheric sciences, satellite                           weather data, computer-based telecommunications and analysis                    of weather data.  The teachers and atmospheric scientists                       will spend a year designing instructional strategies for                        classroom use and a curriculum for training teachers in the                     content and delivery of inquiry-driven weather units.                                                                                                           Weather is a content topic that lends itself well to urban                      school districts.  With the right instructional strategies,                     weather can be a springboard to teaching inquiry skills,                        data analysis, computer applications, and a wide variety of                     problem-solving strategies.  The proposed planning effort                       has the potential for wide impact on the New York City                          science curriculum, and on instructional programs in many                       other large cities.",
