 "awd_abstract_narration": "The implementation phase of STEP is beginning to take shape on a                wide international scale.  Satellites AKEBONO, SOLAR-A, and UARS                are in orbit, and major national programs, such as CANOPUS                      (Canada) and CEDAR, GEM, MAX-91 (USA) are in place.  Community                  services such as the US STEP Newsletter and Japan's STEP                        Simulation Promotion Office are beginning to play a crucial role                in communications and scholarly exchange.  Recognizing the                      importance of STEP and the need to assure participation of all                  space missions, the International Council of Scientific Unions                  recently extended the formal duration of STEP until 1997.  In                   view of the increased demands for international coordination, and               to assure continuity of the operations, the Bureau of the                       Scientific Committee of Solar-Terrestrial Physics recently                      appointed the Principal Investigator to another year in his                     functions as the International STEP Coordinator.  Support is                    requested to enable the PI to continue his tasks in that                        capacity.  His continued participation will be of benefit to the                STEP scientists in the United States, because through his office,               a close link to the international STEP-related information and                  activities will be assured.",
