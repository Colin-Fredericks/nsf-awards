 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop a general strategy                   for attacking environmental waste problems in industrial                        processes, that include process design and optimization,                        application of catalytic and alternative chemistry, reduction                   in the use of toxic chemicals, recycling, and recovery to                       eliminate waste at its source.  The PIs plan to apply process                   design techniques, an improved understanding of process                         chemistry, and newly developed synthetic and catalytic                          chemistries to improve the energy efficiency and cost                           effectiveness of the process to produce sulfolane (as an                        example process), while minimizing waste.  The anticipated                      benefits include: (1) the development of alternative                            processes, chemistries, and approaches that could be used to                    attack environmental and energy problems associated with other                  industrial processes, and (2) the development of models for                     considering environmental costs in process design and                           optimization and exposing chemists to the need to consider                      energy efficiency, by-product production, and waste generation                  and disposal in the design of chemical reactions.                                                                                                               Sulfolane a colorless, water soluble, non-toxic, bio-                           degradable, and highly polar compound, derives its market                       value from its exceptional thermal stability, chemical                          inertness, and solvent properties.  Eighteen to twenty million                  pounds of sulfolane are consumed annually in a variety of                       applications including extraction of aromatic hydrocarbons,                     delignification of wood, removal of acidic compounds from                       natural gas streams, and solutions for polymerization and                       fibre spinning, electroplating baths, and batteries.  In the                    next several years, regulatory changes and the movement to                      \"environmentally improve\" industrial processes could possibly                   increase the market for sulfolanes by 50% or more.  Currently,                  sulfolane is produced via the reaction of 1,3-butadiene with                    sulfur dioxide to produce 3-sulfolene, which then undergoes                     catalytic hydrogenation to yield sulfolane.  These reactions                    are carried out in series in two batch stirred tank reactors.                   Reaction temperatures are maintained by passing water or steam                  through heating jackets around each reactor.  The first step                    in the synthesis requires excess sulfur dioxide and is plagued                  by polysulfone-producing side reactions that limit process                      yield, poison the hydrogenation catalyst, and present waste                     disposal problems.  Removal of the excess sulfur dioxide by                     evacuating or purging the reactor and oxidation reactions                       which produce SOx by-products creates emission problems.  The                   development of improved and alternative methods for the                         synthesis and processing of sulfolane could eliminate or                        minimize these environmental concerns, improve energy                           efficiency, and reduce product cost.  Phillips Petroleum, one                   of the two domestic producers of sulfolane, will be actively                    involved in this research project.",
