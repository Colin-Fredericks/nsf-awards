 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will pursue a basic research program                               aimed toward developing a fundamental                                           understanding of the nonlinear response of optical                              materials.  Our past research was initially aimed at                            two-photon absorption (2PA) in semiconductors.                                  This goal led to a predictive capability for 2PA                                coefficients not only for semiconductors but also for                           wide gap dielectrics.  A difficulty encountered in                              these experiments is that nonlinear refraction always                           accompanies nonlinear absorption so that an                                     understanding of the origins of this nonlinear                                  refraction is also needed.  Therefore, we broadened                             the scope of the program.  We have developed a new,                             accurate and sensitive measurement technique, the                               Z-scan, which can give the sign and magnitude of                                nonlinear refraction as well as nonlinear absorption.                           This technique is rapidly gaining wide acceptance as                            a standard measurement and gives complementary                                  information to other methods that we use such as                                four-wave mixing.  This technique is being used to                              rapidly increase the data base of nonlinear materials                           constants.  Our measurements to date show both                                  bound and photogenerated carrier nonlinearities.                                The free-carrier nonlinearities are well predicted by                           band blocking models.  The fast bound electronic                                refraction n2 is given by a Kramers-Kronig (KK)                                 integral of the nonlinear absorption spectrum                                   including 2PA, electronic Raman and AC-Stark                                    contributions.  We established this theory and                                  demonstrated agreement with experiment over a four                              orders of magnitude change in n2 including a sign                               change for semiconductors and dielectrics.  We                                  propose to study the nondegenerate nonlinearities                               (eg. n2 at w1 due to w2) which are also predicted by                            the theory.  The outcome of these studies, besides the                          data base, will be the establishment of a predictive                            capability for use by optoelectronic device researchers                         to determine nonlinear coefficients of other materials                          at other wavelengths including dual wavelength                                  applications.  These materials constants are                                    important, for example, for applications in all optical                         switching, optical limiting, and laser-induced damage.                          In addition, we have recently observed an effective                             X(3) caused by the cascading of X(2):X(2) in a second                           harmonic generating crystal (KTP) that looks quite                              promising for obtaining large nonlinear refraction for                          the fundamental.  As several organic materials have                             been shown to have very high X(2)'s, we are initiating                          studies in organic materials of the cascaded as well as                         other nonlinearities (eg. in phthalocyanine dyes).                              Questions of the applicability of the KK analysis to                            classes of organic materials will be examined.",
