Analysis of the protein sequence predicted from the corresponding               cDNA, and other data, indicate that Ftr1 encodes a membrane-                    associated protein that functions through some form of self versus              non-self recognition and that its activity is influenced by                     activity of the mating-type genes and a linked genetic element.                 These concepts will be tested by the following methods:1) a tag to              determine the location of FRT1 within cells.  2)  Employ the                    techniques of in vivo mutagenesis to start determining which parts              of the Frt1 sequence are essential for activity.  3) Isolate and                start characterizing the linked DNA sequence which, in addition to              Frt1, is essential for fruiting this will be done using the method              of DNA-mediated transformation to test the sequences flanking Frt1              for their ability to restore the fruiting phenotype in the                      appropriate Frt1 deletion mutations.  4) Isolate and start                      characterizing an alternate allele of Frt1 by using Frt1 , and/or               flanking sequences, as probe to a clone bank of an alternate strain             of S. commune.                                                                  %%%                                                                             Mechanistic concepts elucidated by studying genetic regulation of               this important developmental process in this relatively simple                  eukaryote should be applicable to an understanding of similar                   processes in more complex, less accessible organisms.",
