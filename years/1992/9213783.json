 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to study adaptation of a biosensor                            electrode system capable of virus detection within a few                        hours to the detection of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus                      (HIV) in fluids of environmental significance.  The                             concept is based upon successful application of an                              electrode to the detection of toxic chemicals by detection                      of changes in the respiratory activity of a biofilm of                          appropriate host cells mounted on the surface of a                              galvanic cell oxygen electrode.  Objectives of this                             project include assessment of the feasibility of using the                      biofilm electrode for detection of the HIV in comparison                        with conventional tissue procedures and the \"polymerase                         chain reaction,\" and to determine the potential of an                           electrode-based system for determining the survival                             characteristics of the HIV in environmental media.  The                         investigator will be coordinating this research with that                       being conducted under NSF Grant No. 9018567 by Dr. Rasul                        Chaudhry at Oakland University.                                                                                                                                 The proposal leading to this award was submitted to NSF                         under conditions outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for                        Exploratory Research (SGER).  While there is no present                         indication that the environmental media have a role in                          spreading the virus from infected to non-infected                               individuals, the potential does exist.  The HIV has been                        shown to survive for significant periods of time in the                         environment.  Results of this research may provide the                          basis for an analytical technique that could be used in                         conduct of research on the survival characteristics of the                      HIV when subjected to environmental stress as occurs in                         collection systems, treatment processes and systems for                         management of wastes infected with the HIV.",
