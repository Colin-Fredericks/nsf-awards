 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research project seeks to understand the nature              and determinants of long term changes in humanity's competence to               deal with global environmental risks.  It views that competence as              a product of possible interactions among various domestic, state,               and international actors:  in particular the scientific community,              non-governmental organizations, private sector interests, national              governments, the media, and international organizations.  Changing              competence is characterized in terms of the changes in the                      performance of six management functions: risk assessment, the                   placing or risks in context, response assessment, strategy                      formulation, policy implementation, and monitoring/evaluation.                                                                                                  The principal theoretical goal of the project is to establish the               major processes by which such changes occur, the determinants of                those processes, and how both change with time.  Special attention              is paid to determining the extent to which cumulative learning, as              opposed to changing bureaucratic structures, interest                           configurations, or power alignments, underlies observed changes in              management.  The principal applied goal is to establish the most                important factors constraining cumulative improvements in                       functional performance, and to characterize policies that might be              expected to improve prospects for learning how to manage global                 environmental risks.  These goals are pursued as part of a larger               international collaborative effort involving detailed case studies              of how 8 countries have dealt with the risks posed by climate                   change, ozone depletion and acid rain.  The work focuses on                     changing social competencies that have emerged from the                         interactions of one particularly influential country -- the United              States -- with the family of organizations over the last 30 years.",
