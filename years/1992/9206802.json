The research will develop two novel methods for                      attaching DNA and other biomolecules to substrates for their                    subsequent examination by scanning probe microscopy.                            Successful implementation of these attachment methods will                      allow the full power of scanning tunneling and atomic force                     microscopy to be applied to the structural characterization of                  biomolecules and other macromolecular systems.  Such structural                 information is essential to understanding the mechanisms of                     biomolecule reactions and their relation to life processes.                     %%%                                                                             The ability to anchor a large biomolecule to a substrate for                    microscopic examination will be developed in this research                      project.  The interaction of scanning microscopy probes with                    the molecule under study has limited the applicability of these                 powerful methods for large molecules.  This research project                    promises to address these limitations, resulting in a better                    understanding of the structure of these  biologically important                 molecules.",
