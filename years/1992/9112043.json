 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for the development of a technique to                     obtain triple Doppler Radar measurement of convective storms                    using aircraft radar alone.  Airborne Doppler radars that make                  fore and aft conical scans, such as the recently modified NOAA                  P-3 radars and the NCAR ELDORA radar now under development, could               be used with this technique.  The advantage of triple over dual                 Dopper analysis is that all three components of precipitation                   particle velocity can be obtained.  Using mass continuity to                    obtain vertical air motion, particle terminal velocity can be                   derived, which allows inferences to be made about precipitation                 growth.  This technique also makes possible a superior estimate                 of vertical air motion at cloud top, which is needed to derive                  accurate vertical air velocities.                                                    This technique will be used to measure vertical mass fluxes                and precipitation evolution in oceanic convective clouds during                 the intensive field phase of TOGA COARE.  Both pieces of                        information are important in characterizing the convection in the               COARE domain.  A preliminary test of the technique will be made                 during the Tropical Cyclone Initiation experiment in July 1991                  using a P-3 radar.                                                                   Results of these measurements will be used to test a model                 development to predict the vertical fluxes of mass, heat, and                   moisture in cumulus clouds.                                                          This research is important because it is a key study in                    TOGA/COARE both to describe and understand the principal                        atmospheric processes that organize convection and to link those                convective scale physical processes to the larger scales that                   affect climate variability in an especially climate sensitive                   region of the world, the western Pacific Ocean, the field site of               TOGA/COARE.",
