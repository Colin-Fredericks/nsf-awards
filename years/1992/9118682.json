 "awd_abstract_narration": "Juvenile hormone (JH) controls the development of insects during                juvenile stages and also, in many species, egg development in the               adult females. In all insects JH secretion ceases at some time                  during the last larval stage thus permitting the insect to undergo              metamorphosis to the adult stage. JH secretion resumes shortly                  before or after the emergence of the adult and promotes egg                     maturation. The processes by which the reappearance of JH prior to              adult emergence is regulated are not known. The results of the                  proposed investigations will fill the gap in our knowledge about                this critical event in the life of insects.                                     The proposed studies will be done on the tobacco hornworm moth,                 Manduca sexta. This insect is used as a model for many                          physiological, biochemical  and behavioral studies. We will examine             the changes in the biosynthesis of JH during metamorphosis with                 standard biochemical methods, and investigate the neuroendocrine                basis for the reactivation of JH biosynthesis. These studies are                the first of this kind and will be of fundamental importance in the             field of developmental endocrinology. Since Manduca sexta belongs               to the order Lepidoptera, which includes some of the most                       destructive crop pests, the proposed studies may also have an                   important bearing on the development of new strategies for limiting             the reproductive  potential of pest species.",
