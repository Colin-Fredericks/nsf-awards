 "awd_abstract_narration": "Legal institutions are used increasingly in modern society to                   mediate disputes and resolve conflicts.  Previous research and                  portrayals in popular culture, however, suggest that lawyers in the             U.S. have a serious \"image\" problem and that clients are generally              dissatisfied with the quality of their legal services.                          Dissatisfaction with lawyers and legal services can be                          disfunctional for society because it hampers the resolution of                  particular cases and may discourage the the use of law to resolve               future conflict.                                                                                                                                                This grant will provide a comprehensive examination of public                   opinion about legal remedies to disputes, and assess the extent,                causes and consequences of client dissatisfaction with their legal              services in disputes related to divorce, torts, and criminal                    complaints.  While focus groups and personal interviews will be                 used in the early stages of the research, the primary data will be              derived from telephone surveys of a national probability sample of              1000 citizens.  The survey gives particular attention to clients'               perceptions of the style of lawyering and social power strategies               used by their attorneys and how these factors influence ratings of              procedural justice, satisfaction with legal services, and future                intentions of using legal methods of dispute settlement. The                    results of this study will fill an important empirical gap in our               understanding of public perceptions of lawyers and the use of legal             remedies to redress disputes.  Also, the results will contribute                to theoretical discussions about the future utility of traditional              legal solutions to interpersonal disputes in modern society.",
