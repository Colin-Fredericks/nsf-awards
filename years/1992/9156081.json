 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two new first year courses for non-science, non-engineering                     students will be developed.  The courses will examine, in a                     clear and practical way, important technologies which affect                    everyday life.  The technologies studied will illustrate the                    application of science and mathematics to real world problems                   and will show how the engineering method is applied to develop                  and continually improve each example of technology.  This                       partially quantitative study of different technologies will be                  interesting to non-engineering students and will greatly                        increase their technological literacy and insight to a level                    which cannot come from the most rigorous mathematics or science                 courses.  Subject matter in the courses will change over time                   and will deal with topics of current national or local interest                 such as Energy and Society, Electricity Supply, Modern                          Communications, and Family Housing.  Engineering, Arts,                         Humanities, and Social Science faculty will participate                         together in the courses.  Much of the teaching will be done by                  Engineers, but each topic will be set in a social and                           historical context.  Field trips and laboratory projects will                   be incorporated as much as possible.  Achievement of the                        project objective will be measured by a comparison of the                       attitudes, activities, and achievements of students who have or                 have not taken the courses.  The project is intended to provide                 a model for other institutions interested in improving the                      scientific and technological literacy of their non-science and                  non-engineering students.",
