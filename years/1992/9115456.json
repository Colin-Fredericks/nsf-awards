 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of Dr. Robert Drennan, Mr. Robert Kruger, a                  graduate student in anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh,               will collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  Mr. Kruger will               conduct an archaeological survey of an approximately 100 square                 kilometer area situated between the sites of San Lorenzo and El                 Macayal which are located in the Gulf region of Mexico.  Both                   these large sites are attributable to the Olmec and Mr. Kruger's                survey will yield valuable data on the rural population which                   surrounded and sustained them.  The surface survey will be                      augmented by limited stratigraphic testing and materials such as                potsherds will be collected and identified.                                                                                                                     The Olmec was the first complex stratified society to arise in                  Middle America and Olmec peoples constructed impressive                         ceremonial sites with monumental-scale stone sculptures.  While                 these large sites have been the subject of archaeological                       scrutiny, very little is known about either the hinterlands which               surround them (where the majority of the farming population                     likely lived) or the process which led to the development of this               complexity.  Several theories have been proposed and these vary                 from postulated intergroup competition and warfare to the                       development of internal status differention within single groups.               Mr. Kruger believes that through analysis of settlement pattern                 and how it changes over time it should be possible to select                    among alternative scenarios.                                                                                                                                    This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                data of interest to a large number of Middle Americanist                        archaeologists.  It will increase our understanding of the                      processes which lead to the development and maintenance of                      complex societies  and assist in the training of an extremely                   promising young scientist.//",
