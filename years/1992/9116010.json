 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mineral barite BaSO4) is an ubiquitous component of particulate             material in the water column, and of pelagic sediments.  Many                   workers have noted a correlation between the abundance of barite in             sediments and productivity in overlying surface waters.  Barite is              clearly important in the geochemical cycle of Ba, and it is also                quite insoluble and therefore resists dissolution and diagenetic                exchange in sediments.  Furthermore, three elements for which the               seawater isotopic composition is important for solving many                     paleoceanographic problems (Sr, S and Nd) occur in barite in                    amounts that permit precise isotopic measurements to be made on                 very small amounts of the separated phase.  For all of these                    reasons, barite appears to be an important tracer of productivity,              geochemical cycling, and a host of processes that may affect                    seawater chemical and isotopic compositions, e.g. climate,                      tectonics, sealevel change and rates of marine hydrothermal                     activity.  Nevertheless, the present understanding of the sites and             mechanisms of barite formation, transport, and fate in the                      sedimentary column is very incomplete and the linkage between Ba,               barite and C fluxes need to be clarified.  In this research a mass-             balance, morphological, geochemical and isotopic approach to the                study of the cycling of barite in upper sedimentary layers of the               equatorial Pacific and its relation to the C cycling will be made               Novel aspects of the work include the use of Nd, Sr  and S isotopes             as clues to the environment of formation and possible recycling of              barite.  This study will make use of sediment trap, filtered and                bottom sediment samples, and will be closely coordinated with                   geochemical and isotopic investigations of the water column by                  other workers.  It will also be undertaken with close attention to              the potential of barite as a contemporary as well as a paleo                    monitor of biogeochemical and isotopic characteristics of seawater.",
