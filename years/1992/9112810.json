In particular four tasks                                             will be addressed.  First, rigorous                                             proofs of the reconstruction                                                    formulas derived formally in the                                                preliminary research will be made.                                              The rigorous proofs will give more                                              credence to these formulas,                                                     possibly eliminate any oversights                                               made in the formal derivations, and                                             will result in a better conceptual                                              understanding of the formulas                                                   involved.  Developing the rigorous                                              proofs will also provide a strong                                               background for another task to be                                               performed -- the development of                                                 quadratures.  Fast and accurate                                                 quadratures are needed for                                                      computing the singular, spherical                                               integrals which are involved in                                                 several cone--beam reconstruction                                               formulas.  Since complete                                                       information can not be measured                                                 from some date collection                                                       geometries that are mechanically                                                simple to implement, another task                                               to be addressed is the development                                              of extrapolation methods that will                                              help compensate for this lack of                                                complete information.  Closely                                                  related to the development of                                                   extrapolation methods is the task                                               of development of extrapolation                                                 methods is the task of developing                                               properties of an intermediate                                                   function which is being computed in                                             several of the reconstruction                                                   methods.  Properties of this                                                    intermediate function will be                                                   developed with the goal of                                                      improving the accuracy an speed of                                              its computation.",
