 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project replaces obsolete research                                    laboratories and research support facilities at The                             Jackson Laboratory which cannot be rehabilitated                                cost-effectively.                                                                    The new scope of the project affects only                                  Laboratories that are in direct research use, and                               involves the replacement of 5,408 net square feet                               located in our Research Laboratory-2, Reserach                                  Laboratory-4 and Research Laboratory-5 buildings                                (hereafter known as RL-2, RL-4, and RL-5).                                           The research programs at The Jackson                                       Laboratory encompass four areas:  Genetics,                                     Developmental Biology, Molecular Biology and                                    Biochemistry and Physiology.  Our training programs                             are designed to meet the needs of high school and                               college students, postdoctoral trainees, graduate                               students and established scientists.  In addition,                              this space houses the Transgenic Mouse Service,                                 Flow Cyometry Service, Microchemistry Service and                               Gene Targeting/Cell Biology Service.                                                 The project will provide state-of-the-art                                  facilities to improve the creativity and                                        productivity of research, and enhance the quality                               of our training programs.  The new facilities will                              correct overcrowded conditions and critical safety                              and fire code deficiencies; they will also provide                              mechanical, electrical and ventilation systems                                  required to support our current and future research                             and research training activities.  Accessibility to                             the new facility by disabled persons will be fully                              addressed.  The modernization of this research                                  space will not only create a healthful and safe                                 work place for the staff, it will also                                          significantly reduce high operating costs                                       associated with the operation and maintenance of                                outdated research facilities.",
