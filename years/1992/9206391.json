 "awd_abstract_narration": "The organic matrix permeates the structure of calcareous                   shells, enveloping the individual crystals and binding them                     together.  It is essentially invisible in the scanning electron                 microscopy (SEM) of cut of fractured shell sections, and has                    received little attention as a structural component.  It is                     important in the taphonomy of fossil shells, for as long as it                  remains intact the original crystallography is preserved.                            One technique does exist for the SEM investigation of the                  organic matrix in its normal relationship to shell microstructure.              This involves cutting, polishing, and etching a section through the             shell, and preserving the exposed organic matrix in place by                    critical point drying.                                                               This project will examine the utility of this technique in                 determining the degree of degradation of organic matrix in fossil               mollusks.  Four collections of fossils will be examined,                        representing both calcite and aragonite in a variety of                         microstructures and over a range of preservational quality.  If                 measures of matrix degradation can provide a consistent means of                determining early stages of alteration in fossil shells, it will                open up new avenues of study in the field of taphonomy, and provide             a source of supporting data for studies on fossil geochemistry.",
