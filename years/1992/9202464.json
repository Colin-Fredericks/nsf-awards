Candidates with background                           in India who apply to AIIS are screened, and those                              nominated are referred to NSF for final selection.                              The AIIS manages the required clearances for the                                research, and the logistics involved in the travel,                             local arrangement and conduct of research in India.                             They therefore meet NSF and Government of India                                 requirements as well as the scientists' needs.                                  Areas of research typically include anthropology,                               linguistics, sociology, economics, political sciences                           as well as biology, mathematics and engineering.                                The U.S.-India program supports U.S. scientific                                 research in India in areas of interest to NSF and                               where the research could lead to better understanding                           between the two countries through science.  This project                        meets program criteria.                                                                                                                                         Scope:  The AIIS is a very well organized institute                             with membership of over 42 of the major U.S.                                    universities and colleges with South Asian or Indian                            Studies programs.  The AIIS reviews their applicants                            through selection panels made of eminent scientists                             in various broad scientific disciplines.  The AIIS                              offices in New Delhi and other major cities in India                            have well-established contacts with Government of India                         departments and are capable of facilitating U.S.                                researchers' collaboration with host institutes.                                The areas of research considered are broad, and                                 funds from this project are used only for those                                 normally supportable by NSF science divisions.  The                             candidates and awardees are carefully screened both                             by the AIIS and by NSF.  This program clearly                                   strengthens the scientific collaboration and                                    understanding between India and the U.S.",
