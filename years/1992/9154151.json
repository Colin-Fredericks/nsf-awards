The materials used in the                       workshop were developed by the project director with partial                    support from the National Science Foundation.  These materials                  have been the subject of two textbooks published by major                       publishing companies.Following the initial workshop,                            participants complete individual investigations in                              computational physics and report the results of these                           activities during a two-day follow-up session.  Participants                    gain both useful teaching methods and an opportunity to remain                  intellectually vigorous within their discipline.",
