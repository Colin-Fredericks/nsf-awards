 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid expansion in the areas of Computer Animation, Scientific                  Visualization, and Computer Vision make it desirable that                       students have access to appropriate laboratory equipment so                     that they may practice the techniques they learn in the                         classroom and become familiar with the use of modern animation                  and vision instrumentation.  This project involves acquisition                  of animation equipment and computer vision input devices that                   will update and expand the University's existing graphics                       laboratory. The Animation and Vision lab will allow two new                     courses to be taught, Animation Techniques and Scientific                       Visualization Methods.  It will also provide a hands-on                         laboratory for the current Computer Vision course.  The lab                     will be used for development of student assigned programs and                   animations in these courses as well as independent study and                    especially senior projects and master's theses.  The lab will                   also be used by instructors to develop videotapes which                         demonstrate various animation, computer graphics, and                           scientific visualization concepts and algorithms.  Course                       materials developed by instructors, in particular instructional                 videos which utilize the full spectrum of graphics techniques                   to aid students in understanding sophisticated concepts, will                   be shared with other CSU campuses and additional institutions                   as appropriate.",
