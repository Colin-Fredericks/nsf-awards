 "awd_abstract_narration": "While traditional sex ratio theory predicts organisms will produce              roughly equal proportions of the sexes, many species exhibit                    persistent sex ratio biases.  Consequently, there now exists a rich             diversity of theory pertaining to biased sex ratios.  Meiotic                   drive, cytoplasmic inheritance and other non-Mendelian mechanisms               of sex ratio distortion may play a major role in the evolution of               biased sex ratios.  Meiotic drive systems, including sex ratio                  distorters, may be central to our understanding of evolutionary                 processes such as sex chromosome evolution, the evolution and                   diversity of sex determining mechanisms, and the origin of                      sterility barriers between species (including Haldane's Rule).                  Initial research has shown that certain families of Silene alva, a              dioecious plant, exhibit severely female biased sex ratios.                     Studies involving molecular markers of the Y chromosome show that               the vias is present in the seed and is therefore, not due to a                  higher mortality of male progeny.  Sex ratio bias is inherited                  through or expressed in the male parent. This pattern of                        inheritance and other circumstantial evidence lead one suspect and              X-linked meiotic drive system may be responsible for the evolution              of the female bias.  The proposed research will determine the                   genetic basis of sex ratio distortion in Silene alba                            by using reciprocal crosses and backcrosses.  RAPD markers,                     will be used to investigate specifically how and when the female                bias develops.  Crosses among geographically separated populations              and among closely related species will be used to detect                        sex ratio distortion which is normally suppressed by restorers.                 Finally, whether the structure of natural populations                           of Silene alba is consistent with other mechanisms of selection for             biased sex ratios will be determined.  These results will provide               information the nature and diversity of genetic mechanisms                      influencing sex ratio in natural populations.  Moreover, because                sex chromosome markers and wide crosses represent unique approaches             to studying sex ratio genetics,it is expected that methods will                 stimulate research into mechanisms of sex ratio bias in other                   species.",
