 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a curriculum of philosophical studies,                with an emphasis on ethics, especially appropriate for graduate                 students in the sciences.  The curricular model will be                         implemented in the specific setting of a marine biological                      laboratory.  In many respects such laboratories resemble small,                 liberal arts college campuses.  The setting should be conducive                 to integrating philosophical and scientific issues, methods, and                problems.  Four course modules or seminars are proposed in the                  following order:  1) Theories of Sciences; 2) Theories of Ethics;               3) Ethics of the Environment and Development; and 4) Professional               Ethics.  Each are two-credit, half-semester courses, which will                 meet for two hours a week over eight weeks; students are expected               to participate in the entire sequence.  Novel features include                  introducing graduate students to philosophy through a course in                 the history and philoosphy of science, requiring work in ethical                theory before truning to issues in applied ethics, including non-               Western (Chinese) materials and perspectives in all facets of the               curriculum, and exploring the question of need or desirability of               developing a specific code of professional ethics for research                  scholars in the biological and envirnomental sciences.  Results                 from the project will be disseminated at the meetings of two                    scientific groups:  The National Association of Marine                          Laboratories and The Estuarine Research Federation.  There are                  also plans to develop a syllabus and annotated bibliography.",
