 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a long-term visit by Professor Robert                   Yeats, Department of Geosciences, Oregon State University, to                   Japan for a cooperative research project with Dr. Yoshi Kinugaso                of the Seismotectonic Research Division at the Geological Survey                of Japan in Tsukuba.  The Research will include a study of the                  recognition and evaluation of seismogenic blind thrusts.                        Earthquakes that occur in fold belts can be studied using surface               geology and subsurface well logs and seismic lines, particularly                those that occur in petroleum-producing regions.  A better                      understanding of the tie between folds, faults and seismegenesis                in recent years is partly the result of a growing awareness of                  the extreme hazards posed by fault propagation fold systems in                  highly populated regions of California.  Research will include a                study of the structural aspects of earthquake faults that do not                cut the surface but instead appear to be accommodated by                        regional-scale folding.                                                                                                                                         Results of the research have the potential of broadening U.S.                   databases on seismogenic zones expressed at the surface as folds.               Additionally, the research could lead to the possibility of                     constraining earthquake size by considering the possibility of                  fault and fold segmentation as well as slip rate.  The Geological               Survey of Japan is well known for their ongoing research in the                 area of evaluating seismic risks from surface faulting.  Their                  expertise, coupled with Professor Yeats' expertise in the area of               seismic risks from blind faults, should provide a fruitful                      collaboration.  It is expected that this collaborative effort                   will continue after the formal agreement has terminated.",
