 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pardon will study the topological and geometric properties of              an algebraic variety (the set of solutions of some polynomial                   equations), particularly when the variety is singular (not smooth).             On the geometric side, he will study the spectrum of the Laplace                operator on such spaces in order to obtain information about their              singularities.  Of particular interest are spectral invariants                  which turn out to be rational, since they are most likely to be                 topological invariants.  Hain, with the help of his students, plans             to continue his study of the topology of spaces that parameterize               compact riemann surfaces and configurations of points on them.  The             main objectives of the project are to compute and/or gain                       qualitative information about the cohomology of these moduli and                configuration spaces, both with trivial and twisted coefficients.               These results should yield geometric results in algebraic geometry,             and may have applications to particle physics via conformal field               theory.  The main tools to be used are Hodge theory and                         representation theory combined with traditional geometric methods.                   The topology and geometry of spaces defined as solution sets               of systems of polynomial equations is a surprisingly rich subject,              having applications in many diverse areas of mathematics and                    mathematical physics.  The investigators and their graduate                     students are bringing to bear a marvelously varied arsenal of                   techniques.  Of particular interest are constructions that depend               explicitly upon features of the geometry of a space, area,                      distance, curvature, and so forth, and yet combine them in such a               way as to be provably dependent only on the topology of the space,              that is on features of the space so basic as to be unaffected by                stretching and distorting its shape, short of cutting or tearing.",
