 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economical methods of removing and/or recovering dissolved                      organics or metals from water are necessary for US industrial                   competitiveness.  Also, firms specializing in hazardous waste                   disposal and pollution control will be a major area of                          industrial growth in the US.  Micellar-enhanced                                 ultrafiltration (MEUF) is a new process which can remove                        dissolved organics and multivalent metal ions from waters.  In                  MEUF, an ionic surfactant, which forms aggregates called                        micelles, is added to water.  Organic and metallic species                      associate or bind with the micelles.  The solution is then                      treated in an ultrafiltration device with membrane pore sizes                   small enough to block the passage of micelles and the                           associated target solutes.  The result is an extremely pure                     permeate, and a very concentrated, low-volume retentate for                     disposal or much more economical ultimate recovery of the                       solutes.  Unlike most alternative methods, MEUF can                             simultaneously remove both organics and metals.  Reductions in                  concentration of two orders of magnitude in one pass have been                  demonstrated in preliminary work.  The percentage reduction                     does not decrease as the feed solute concentration decreases,                   making this technique particularly effective in the reduction                   of very toxic chemicals from low concentrations to ultralow                     concentrations.//",
