 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compromised brain function can occur in the absence of apparent                 structural damage. Certain types of brain scans which show only                 structural features may appear normal, yet other types of scans                 based on the metabolic activity of the neurons will show changes                in discrete brain regions that are related to the functional                    disturbances. In this award to Drs. Ruthmary Deuel and Lyndon                   Hibbard, the metabolism of brain regions will be measured by the                method of 2-deoxy-D-glucose, which is a metabolic marker. The                   syndrome of hemineglect will be produced by cortical damage and                 changes in metabolic activity in areas removed from the damage                  itself will be studied during the recovery process. The syndrome                of hemineglect involves an abnormality of spatially directed                    attention and motor performance. The precise localization of                    neuronal metabolic changes associated with this syndrome will be                studied by computer reconstruction of brain sections. This work                 will contribute to understanding brain function in normal                       individuals and during recovery from damage.",
