 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area instrumentation development in the subfield                 of infrared spectrometry.  Conventional methods of infrared (IR)                spectroscopy utilize either a small throughout (IR flux) optical                element for dispersion followed a detector (or array), or a large               throughout, scanning interferometer followed by a detector.  A                  new, smart detector design is proposed here for accomplishing                   transform spectroscopy of infrared light directly on the detector               chip itself.  The new method is a large throughput transform                    technique which incorporates the multiplex advantage without                    requiring a mechanically scanned interferometer.  This new                      spectrometer is potentially very small, compact, and rugged,                    especially if it is fabricated on a silicon wafer substrate, as                 is planned (i.e., a spectrometer on a chip).  This opto-                        electronic device structure can also be adapted to other IR                     instrument technologies.  During this Phase I project these                     investigators will make a first loop on the full design and                     concept testing for the graded interference-filter spectrometer                 device.  The concept for this new device for IR transform                       spectroscopy arises out of several areas of strength within the                 research staff at Advanced Fuel Research, Inc., hence the                       potential for success is large.",
