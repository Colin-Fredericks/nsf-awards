 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Geography is purchasing satellite receiving                   and data display equipment to incorporate real-time weather                     maps into the meteorology courses for both science and non-                     science majors.  Students are making use of weather maps as                     part of their laboratory experiences as well as in observing                    the daily weather variations that occur.  The significance of                   this project is that it:  1) incorporates current atmospheric                   conditions into the learning experience for the students,                       thereby allowing the students to become directly involved with                  the subject matter of the course, 2) documents the relevance of                 the science to the non-science student, 3) stimulates the                       curiosity of the students surrounding atmospheric behavior, and                 4) provides non-science students with the opportunity to                        collect and analyze data in an introductory meteorology course.",
