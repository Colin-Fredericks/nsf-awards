 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on the regulatory cascade that                       culminates in the activation of ion transport in the giant                      internodal cell of Chara corallina. Upon illumination, ion                      transport activity in these cells rapidly becomes spatially                     segregated into alternating bands of what appears to be proton                  influx and efflux. Experiments are aimed at discerning the                      potential role of protein dephosphorylation in the activation of                the transport system and in the rapid spatial segregation of ion                movement activities.                                                            %%%                                                                                The movement of ions across the plasma membrane of plant cells               is under strict regulatory control and is responsive to a variety               of extracellular signals. The giant internodal cell from Chara                  corallina provides a unique model system for the study of these                 regulatory cascades because ion movement is triggered by light and              appears to be coupled directly to photosynthetic activity. The                  intermediary steps in signal transduction are not well understood               and are part of the focus for this project. The transduction of                 these signals can provide important clues to mechanisms by which                plant cells regulate transport at the plasma membrane.",
