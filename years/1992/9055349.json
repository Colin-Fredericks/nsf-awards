 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three year program that includes a summer                     workshop offering secondary science and mathematics teachers                    an integrated program of biology, mathematics and curriculum                    change. The central theme of the workshops is Conservation                      Biology. Approximate equal numbers of mathematics and                           science teachers will be selected to participate from a                         nationwide pool, though preference will be given to teachers                    from the Northwest region of the United States. Preference                      will also be given to teams of mathematics and science                          teachers from the same school or school district.                                                                                                               During the course of the program, two overlapping workshops                     (26 teachers in each, beginning in consecutive summers) will                    be conducted. Each workshop will take place over two summers                    and include a four week residential summer workshop, an                         interim academic year, and a one week residential session                       the following summer. The first summer session combines                         field work, laboratories, seminars, and lectures in biology,                    mathematics and curriculum development. During the                              intervening year, participants will test program changes in                     their home institutions while interacting with fellow                           participants and faculty through a computer network. The                        final one week session, during the second summer, provides                      opportunities for participants to share successes and                           difficulties, develop future plans, and reinforce the                           participants' commitment to curriculum development.                                                                                                             An amount equal to 13% of NSF costs will be provided as cost                    sharing",
