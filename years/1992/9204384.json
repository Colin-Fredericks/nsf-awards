 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports mathematical research on problems                      concerned primarily with the extension of functions and mappings                defined on boundaries of domains in several complex variables.                  The boundaries are generalizations of surfaces, known as (real)                 manifolds. The idea of extending a function from the manifold to                a holomorphic function on the domain is actually a boundary value               problem in partial differential equations.  Functions which can                 be extended must satisfy certain (Cauchy-Riemann) conditions on                 the manifold.                                                                        It has recently been shown that all CR functions on a                      generic manifold extend over a wedge in a neighborhood of some                  point of the manifold.  Work will now be done adapting newly                    developed techniques to establish the location of the wedge.                    Another research direction will be that of determining geometric                conditions for extending CR functions over a neighborhood of the                manifold.                                                                            Analyticity or wedge-extendibility of a CR function on a CR                manifold propagates along complex curves in the manifold.  A                    natural consideration is also the propagation of CR                             extendibility.  Work will be done in showing that CR                            extendibility is transported in parallel with respect to some                   connection on M.  A basic tool in all the work is that of using                 analytic discs to localize the analysis.                                             Work on mappings between CR manifolds will focus on                        continuous maps between analytic manifolds to determine the                     extent to which continuity actually implies that the mappings are               holomorphic.  Some initial smoothness assumptions will be made                  coupled with the use of the reflection principle on attached                    analytic discs.",
