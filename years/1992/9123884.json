 "awd_abstract_narration": "Awareness of global environmental change as a problem for                  human societies and the biosphere has developed rapidly during                  the past decade.  Humans respond positively to environmental                    change in one of two ways, by either adapting to changes which                  affect their activities or by anticipating unacceptable                         environmental change with the goal of preventing or minimizing                  its effects.  The ways in which individuals respond to global                   environmental change as perceived is little understood and under                researched.  This project will focus on the public's perception                 of global environmental problems and how this shapes the way in                 which people respond to these problems.  It will also examine the               influence of geographical scale on public beliefs and attitudes.                The study will engage focus groups of citizens in several cities                on various aspects of their attitudes and beliefs about global                  change at different spatial scales.  A national telephone survey                will provide both qualitative and quantitative information about                public perceptions of global change and the range of possible                   responses people might make to combat it.                                            This research will improve existing knowledge of the                       societal response to global warming by investigating the role                   that behaviorally relevant beliefs play in shaping people's                     interest in it, their perception of its characteristics, their                  assumptions about its effects, and the likelihood that they will                take personal action or support societal action to minimize these               effects.  It will enhance theoretical understandings of the human               response to threats of global change, and it will inform public                 policy as to the ways in which global warming is perceived.",
