 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are a highly sophisticated                and increasingly popular type of material handling device in                    flexible manufacturing systems.  Previous technology dictated                   movement of AGVs on a track embedded in the floor or on a painted               chemical strip.  The increasing popularity of flexible, free-                   ranging AGVs has brought with it a host of research issues related              to effective traffic control schemes and conflict-free routing                  strategies for different demand assignments.  The focus of this                 project will be on the development of effective methodologies for               real-time control of free-ranging AGVs.                                              This research will extend previous work on conflict-free                   routes for AGVs by testing a variety of column-generation schemes               and assignment rules in the free-ranging environment.  Alternate                objective functions for the static problem and the feasibility of               new approaches for real-time routing of AGVs will be tested with                the aid of a factorial-designed simulation experiment.  The                     experiment will be conducted in both job-shop and cellular                      manufacturing environments based on the layout of a very large                  manufacturing facility in Western New York.                                                                                                                          //",
