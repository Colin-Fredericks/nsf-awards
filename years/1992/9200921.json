 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dramatic success of the export-oriented industrialization                   strategy of the East Asian countries based on inexpensive labor                 enabled these countries to rapidly attain the status of newly                   industrializing countries (NICs).  The assessment of the potential              of these countries to move from the semi-periphery to the core of               the capitalist world economy depends on assembling empirical                    evidence at both the level of within-country and that of across-                countries.  With this evidence the nature and extent of                         expansionism of core transnational corporations (TNCs) of a given               industry can be estimated and utilized to facilitate                            disentanglement of the complex patterns of the industrial mobility              of NICs in the world economic system.  This doctoral dissertation               project will make a cross-country inter-industry comparison by                  comparing Korea with Latin American cases over the last three                   decades and a within-industry comparison by studying the divergent              market strategies toward transnational corporations that the three              Korean automobile manufacturers--Hyundai, Daewoo, and Kia--took in              order to provide a solid empirical foundation for explicating the               global functioning of transnational corporations and the impact                 that they have had on the Korean automobile industry.  Statistical              and historical data from the Korean automobile manufacturers and                government agencies with be combined with data from interviews with             engineers, economists and managers at the auto companies and with               auto experts and economic and social historians in order to                     illuminate the developmental process.                                                                                                                                This project will contribute to social scientific                          understandings of the paradoxical relationship between dependency               and development and of the process of industrialization from a                  world system perspective.  This project also will provide an                    excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to              develop independent research skills.",
