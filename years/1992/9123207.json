 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of the competition between energy                              randomization and chemical reactivity in a series of carefully                  chosen reactions will be conducted with the goal of testing the                 RRKM theory of kinetic reactivity. The addition of carbon                       labelled singlet methylene to selected dienes and a fluorinated                 aryl vinyl system will be evaluated. Perturbation of the Cope                   rearrangement by phenyl groups will also be investigated. In                    addition, the concept of solvent friction and the resultant                     effect on chemical reactivity of steroidal heptaenes will be                    investigated under a variety of conditions. Finally, the effect                 of configuration and substitution on the stability of                           pentadienyl radicals will be determined, and the two-step                       dimerization of polyenes will be explored.                                      %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor W. Doering at Harvard University.                  The studies are designed to provide critical information for a                  number of reactions which proceed upon exposure to heat. The                    objective of the investigation will be to determine how                         molecules decide to direct the energy they absorb: do they                      distribute the energy evenly throughout the molecule or do they                 direct the energy to weak parts of the molecule which                           subsequently undergo specific chemical reactions? Another                       aspect of the investigation will be to determine the critical                   effect that solvent viscosity has on the reactions of chemical                  species that are comprised of a series of doubly bonded carbon                  atoms.",
