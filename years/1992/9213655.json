Ofoli, an associate professor at MSU, for training in                           experimental and theoretical colloid science in the Department                  of Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.  He                      will perform a series of experimental components deal with the                  initial rate of flocculation of colloids, and evaluation of                     the internal reflection microscopy as a tool for studying                       adsorption at the liquid-liquid interface.  The theoretical                     foundation will be built also through coursework.  It is                        expected that the present award will allow Dr. Ofoli to                         redirect his efforts to new research areas and with new                         investigation techniques.  During his training at CMU , Dr.                     Ofoli will prepare a detailed plan for his independent                          research after his return at MSU.",
