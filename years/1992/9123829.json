 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the proposed research is to clarify the band structures              and fundamental properties of quantum wells and superlattices                   constructed from semiconductors of the II-VI family, of which CdTe              is a representative member.  The methods to be employed involve the             measurement of photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation and              optical absorption spectra at ambient and low temperatures and                  hydrostatic pressures up to 100 kilobars generated in anvil cells.              The pressure dependences of the band structures of the constituent              semiconductors of the quantum wells and superlattices are well                  established.  Thus from measurement of the changes with pressure of             the optical properties one can extract those properties                         attributable to the specific geometry of the quantum wells and                  superlattices.  The use of high pressure in the investigation of                superlattices offers the best method under certain circumstances of             determining the energy offset between the valence band extrema of               the constituent pair of semiconductors.  An important method of                 measuring this offset, which is crucial to the defemination of all              superlattice properties, is suggested.  Collaborative arrangements              have been made with other scientists to assure a ready supply of                state-of-the-art research materials.",
