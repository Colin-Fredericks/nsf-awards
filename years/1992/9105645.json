 "awd_abstract_narration": "The means by which interferons (IFNs) activate gene expression                through interaction with cellular receptors is being actively                   investigated.  It has been shown that intracellular human IFN-gamma             can activate characteristic responses in murine cells despite the               normal species-specificity barrier presumed to be due to the                    receptor.  This effect is not due to induced synthesis of murine                IFNs or TNF.  Experiments to be performed will determine whether                other secondary mediators could be responsible.  If they are not,               alternative mechanisms by which intracellular IFN-gamma may                     activate gene expression and the relationship between this response             and the normal physiological pathway for IFN-gamma action will be               investigated.  To examine the role of secondary mediators, the                  induction of MHC class II mRNA expression in cells will be assayed              in cells expressing intracellular IFN-gamma transiently or under                a regulatable promoter, or after delivery of IFN-gamma protein by               liposome fusion.  Neutralizing antibodies and inhibitors of protein             synthesis will be added to such cells to block the action or                    production of secondary mediators.  To examine mechanisms by which              intracellular IFN-gamma can activate responses, a search will be                made to identify cytoplasmic proteins which interact with free IFN-             gamma.  Mutations of the IFN-gamma molecule will be used to explore             the role of C-terminal domains in both normal extracellular and                 intracellular activity.                                                                                                                                         The \"comon wisdom\" is that inteferons exert their effects, such as              induction of specific gene expression, on target cells via                      receptor-mediated signal transduction.  The proposed work embraces              an unconventional concept, i.e., that an extracellular ligand can               have an intracellular function.  The experiments proposed will                  explore the hypothesis that IFN acts directly, possibly within the              nucleus, to turn on specific genes.  The information obtained from              this study could turn out to be applicable to signaling mechanisms              used by other cytokines and growth factors.",
