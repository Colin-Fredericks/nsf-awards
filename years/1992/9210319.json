 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze four topics related to               the economic theory of urban transportation.  Given the huge                    costs of major new transportation projects in downtown areas, as                well as the political opposition to such projects, the current                  trend in urban transportation policy is to utilize existing                     capacity more effectively.  This entails primarily demand                       reallocation across travel modes, time of day, and links of the                 urban traffic network.  The dominant cause of the inefficient                   utilization of existing capacity is that urban car travel is                    underpriced because drivers do not pay for the congestion they                  impose on others.                                                                                                                                               Three of the topics concern various aspects of congestion                       pricing.  The first asks the question;  If efficient congestion                 pricing is employed, what proportion of the costs of constructing               and operating an urban traffic network will be covered by tolls?                The second examines efficient parking policy by analyzing how                   much space, both on- and off-street should be provided for                      parking and how should fees be set.  The third topic considers                  some practical aspects of the use of congestion pricing at major                metropolitan airports to replace the current system of weight-                  based landing fees levied on airplane.  The final topic                         investigates how individuals coordinate their daily schedules                   (leisure and work activities) over time and space, with the aim                 of assessing the desirability of government policy to encourage                 more flexible working hours.",
