The consortium is made                    up of ten partner institutions of higher education which                        include Historically Black Institutions and Hispanic-Serving                    Institutions that have strong programs for minority teacher                     preparation.  CMTC was funded by FIPSE to conduct a program                     for precollege students who are considering careers in                          teaching.  The present request is specifically for planning a                   program for teacher preparation with a strong emphasis on the                   preparation of minority teachers.  The funds will be used for                   travel to meetings in order to plan the comprehensive                           proposal.                                                                                                                                                       Cost sharing by CMTC will be approximately 25% of the NSF                       funds.",
