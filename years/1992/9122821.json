 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feral pigs (Sus scrofa L.) are common animals throughout                   much of California.  Their grubbing activities remove vegetation                and disturb soil, prompting concern that they may be harming                    populations of native plants and encouraging alien weeds.                            This project is concerned with the nature and rate of                      revegetation of meadows grubbed by feral pigs.  Observational                   techniques, experimental simulations of key features of pig                     damage, and transplant experiments will be used to achieve the                  following objectives:                                                                1. To describe the seasonality and extent of pig damage                         2. To document the revegetation of areas disturbed by feral                        pigs                                                                         3. The describe the responses of plants to grubbing and to                         infer plant characteristics responsible for between-                    species differences                                                                  4. To identify characteristics of grubbing important to                    revegetation.                                                                        This research will increase both our understanding of the                  threat posed to native plant communities by feral pigs and our                  knowledge of the roles that patchiness and disturbance play in                  plant communities.",
