 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genus Dasymutilla (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) is a                       relatively large group of parasitic wasps distributed predominantly             in North America.  There has not been an extensive study of the                 genus since 1928, and even that study dealt only with species                   inhabiting America North of Mexico.  Less than half of the species              belonging to this genus are known from both sexes.                                   The overall objectives of this study are to complete a                     taxonomic revision of the genus Dasymutilla, including correlation              of the sexes of more species, updating of biological and                        distributional data, providing current keys to the species for both             males and females, and phylogenetic analysis.  The specific goals               to be accomplished through the funding of this project are: 1)                  visit appropriate museums and university collections in order to                examine the holotype specimens of the genus Dasymutilla; 2) study               the general collections of Dasymutilla in museums and universities,             noting geographic distribution, dates of collection, and looking                for specimens taken in copula; and 3) visit as many known                       collection sites as possible, collecting specimens and biological               data, especially for species for which key taxonomic data are                   lacking.",
