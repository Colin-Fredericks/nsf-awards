Jones of the Univerisity of Florida will continue                    his work to examine the rearrangements of alkyl groups from                     metals to carbene centers.  The rearrangment will be attempted                  with first and second row late transitions metals by using                      ligand strain energy to drive the reverse of the migratory                      insertion reaction of the carbene. The synthesis of stable                      carbynes will be attempted using the same strategy.  In                         addition the transition metal complexes of strained allenes,                    their valence isomers, and tropynes will be synthesized and                     studied.                                                                        %%%                                                                             The fundamentally important migrations of molecular fragments                   from metals to carbon will be studied.  These migrations are                    the key steps in numerous important processes including the                     Fischer-Tropsch reaction which converts carbon monooxide and                    hydrogen into hydrocarbons which could potentially be used as                   fuel.  The practical limits of this reaction will be explored                   by examining the migrations of various groups to form novel and                 isolable organometallic compounds.",
