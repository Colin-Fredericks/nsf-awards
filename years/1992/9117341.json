 "awd_abstract_narration": "Correlated Electron Transport in One-Dimensional Channels - The                 object of this project is to build a theoretical structure within               which to treat quantum transport for a system with interacting                  electrons, in particular for narrow channels formed in gated                    semiconductor heterostructures.  Coulomb repulsion between                      electrons becomes crucially important at low electron density,                  resulting in long-range interactions and correlated states.  Two                models for a strongly correlated system of electrons will be                    investigated.  In the first model fluctuations of the electrostatic             potential that forms the channel within the inversion layer is                  taken as much smaller than the electron-electron interaction.  The              second model will take account of strong fluctuations in the                    potential and the resulting formation of almost isolated quantum                dots.  These models will be compared with experimental results.                 %%%                                                                             Recent progress in fabrication of semiconductor structures,                     including electron beam lithography and MBE growth on vicinal                   surfaces, has allowed the systematic experimental study of quantum              transport on submicron length scales.  Existing theories accurately             describe the case where the electrons in a narrow channel move with             very little scattering, and the opposite case where the electrons               are frozen tightly in place.  There is, however and intermediate                regime where a single sample can be changed from a metal to an                  insulator simply by changing the electron density.  This much more              interesting regime cannot be treated using conventional models,                 because they do not include electron-electron interactions                      properly.  This research project proposes to develop models for                 this intermediate transition regime.  Such understanding is quite               important, as this class of effects have been proposed as the basis             for the next generation of ultra-small electronic devices.",
