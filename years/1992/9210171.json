 "awd_abstract_narration": "People hold consensual beliefs about the status value, that is,                 about the competence and worthiness, of individuals.   It is                    puzzling, however, that these beliefs are often based largely                   upon the unordered or nominal categories, such as gender and                    ethnicity, to which these individuals belong.  This proposal                    examines the interactive processes by which such consensual status              values may be acquired.  A theory is proposed that argues that if               a correlation occurs between a given nominal characteristic and the             distribution of economic resources, it constrains face-to-face                  interaction within the population.  In encounters between people                differing in both resources and the nominal characteristic, these               constraints lead to an association between that characteristic and              status-type beliefs.  When individuals bring this status                        association to other encounters and treat people according to it,               the structural constraints on interaction allow it to diffuse                   widely, and it becomes consensual. Specifically, two experiments                will be conducted to test this theory.  The first experiment will               show whether or not an individual participant who works with a                  person who has a different pay level and a different nominal                    characteristic will form expectations states which then transfer                to a later situation where that individual differs from the other               person only in nominal characteristics but not in pay level.  A                 second experiment examines a more \"advanced\" stage of the process,              exploring situations in which the nominal characteristic might                  acquire low status value even for people who have obtained a high               value of the resource.                                                                                                                                          This project will contribute better understanding of the linkage                between social processes at the micro-level and the distribution                of resources reflecting social and economic arrangements at the                 macro-level.  It will also provide information for researchers and              policy makers who are concerned with issues of inequality and                   equity.",
