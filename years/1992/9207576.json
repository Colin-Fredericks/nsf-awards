 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systematics is the scientific study of biodiversity and its                historical patterns and processes.  A broad coalition of systematic             biologists has organized to undertake an initiative to document                 research trends and priorities within their discipline.  This                   initiative  called Systematics Agenda 2000: Integrating Biological              Diversity and Societal Needs, takes as its unifying themes: (1) the             role of systematics in the study and preservation of biodiversity,              (2) the integrative role of systematics in comparative biology, and             (3) the role and importance of systematics in human affairs.                    Systematics Agenda 2000 is directed by a Steering Committee and                 Advisory Board and consists of 27 Standing Committees encompassing              the breadth of systematic biology, including both basic and applied             research.  This grant is to support the work of the Standing                    Committees, to have a general meeting of Standing Committee co-                 chairs to synthesize their findings, to support the work of the                 Steering Committee/Advisory Board, and to support editorial and                 publication expenses.  Systematics Agenda 2000 will publish two                 documents that will synthesize important research trends and                    priorities, identify infrastructural needs for supporting                       systematic research, and document the role and importance of                    systematics in human affairs.",
