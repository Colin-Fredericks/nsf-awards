 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, Dr. Bogdan Lesyng of the Warsaw University of                  Technology, will cooperate with Dr. Andrew J. McCammon of the                   University of Houston under the U.S.-Poland Marie Sklodowska-                   Curie Joint Fund to research \"Quantum-Classical Dynamics Studies                for Proton Transfer Process in Enzymes (MSC).\"  The researchers                 will study phospholipase A2 and either a serine proteinase or                   carbonic anhydrase.  They will treat the enzymes as mixed                       quantum-classical dynamical systems.  The time-dependent                        Schroedinger equation will be used to describe the proton                       dynamics.  The researchers will describe the dynamics of heavy                  atoms by the Newtonian equations of motion with the inclusion of                Hellmann-Feynman forces generated by the quantum particles.                     They will also simulate other quantum events in the enzyme active               sites, like a nucleophilic substitution at the substrate carbonyl               carbon.  They plan to use a well-documented thermodynamic cycle-                perturbation technique to simulate mutations of selected hydrogen               bond network groups into neutral or hydrophobic groups, which                   they will then analyze.                                                                                                                                         This project in biophysics fulfills the program objectives of                   advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the               U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities               in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of               equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
