 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) will develop an                           interdisciplinary national traveling exhibition about raptors                   (birds of prey).  Created in collaboration with The Raptor                      Center at the University of Minnesota (TRC) and the Museum                      Magnet School of the St. Paul School District, this exhibit and                 its related programs will explore themes of biodiversity,                       ecology, and human relationships with the natural world.  It                    will help visitors understand raptors as diverse, charismatic,                  biologically-complex animals whose continued survival is linked                 to fundamental questions of public policy, economics, and                       environmental ethics.  combining the perspectives of the                        sciences with those of the humanities, the exhibit will present                 science in a real-world context of human values and actions.                                                                                                    Opening at SMM in the summer of 1944, the 5,000-square-foot                     exhibit will travel for five years or more to other large                       museums, nature centers, and zoos throughout the U.S.  Using                    specimens, models, artifacts, dioramas, audiovisual programs,                   and interactive components and supported by theater,                            demonstrations, and a variety of other on-site programs, it will                provide a compelling mix of informal learning experiences for                   families, school groups, and other general audiences.  Beyond                   the museum walls, the themes of the project will reach schools                  and other important outreach audiences through videotapes,                      teacher training programs, educational materials, and other                     programs.  SMM will also produce a scaled-down version of the                   exhibit that will tour to smaller museums, nature centers, and                  zoos.",
