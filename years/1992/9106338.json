 "awd_abstract_narration": "A variety of life processes, ranging from muscle contraction to                 nutrient absorption, are either triggered or driven by the                      selective transport of ions across cell membranes.  The working                 hypothesis in virtually all models of mammalian active ion                      transport is that the carrier can assume different conformations in             which the ion binding sites are alternately exposed to opposite                 sides of the membrane.  The mechanism of the conformational change              is unknown.  Does the conformational change gate a channel, or is               extensive rearrangement of the protein structure involved?  The                 principal objective of the research proposed in this application is             to obtain physicochemical data on the conformational transition                 step in the reaction mechanism to permit discrimination among                   alternative proposals for active ion transport.  The forward and                reverse rates of the conformational change reported by fluorescent              labeling of E1E2-pumps will be measured as a function of                        temperature.  Analysis of the results by absolute reaction rate                 theory places contraints on the types of molecular chemical events              that are occurring by resolving the enery which determines the rate             and extent of reaction into heat changes resulting from formation,              or cleavage, of chemical bonds and into changes in the organization             of the system that increase, or decrease, the number of molecular               degrees of freedom.  The transport enzyme, the monovalent cation                and the solvent structure will be empirically varied to learn which             reactants are important and how they affect the conformational                  change in E1E2-enyzmes.",
