 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computerized decision models are increasingly being used                  in the public and private sector for decisions that affect everyone.            Pension funds are invested on the basis of computer models;                     medical student interns are matched with hospitals on the basis of              a computer model; air traffic is controlled on the basis of a                   computer model; income tax laws are changed on the basis of                     models; and so on.  Yet, often those who make decisions on the                  basis of a computer model do not understand the algorithms                      used, or the assumptions made, in  the model.  They cannot                      critically assess the model's output.  Moreover, decisions made                 using computer models are often not accessible to the public that               is affected by them.  Hence, increasing use of, and dependence                  upon, computer models raises important ethical questions.  The                  most serious issues center on the effects of the use of models on               the democratic process, the responsibilities of the model                       designers to their clients and to the public, and the treatment of              risk that is often buried in a model.  While a good deal of research            has been done in recent years on the social impact of computers                 and on the ethical issues surrounding computers, only rarely have               the ethical issues arising from the use of computer decision                    models been addressed.                                                                The investigator will collaborate in identifying and analyzing            the ethical issues surrounding the use of computer models.  The                 analysis will lead to recommendations for change in the way                     models are designed and used, and in the way modelers function                  in their professional roles.  This project furthers VPW program                 objectives to provide opportunities for women to advance their                  careers in science or engineering through research, and to                      encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas through                  the investigator's enhanced visibility as a role model on the host              campus.  The proposed activities which contribute to the second                 objective include:  presenting seminars; arranging informal                     discussion groups for women faculty and students; and                           teaching/co-teaching a course.",
