 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an accomplishment based renewal of a project that                       developed ARCH and related models and tests for cointegration.                  Models of ARCH and cointegration are now used in almost every                   area of economics to test for economic relationships among                      different economic variables using time series data.  These                     studies typically use univariate time series models or                          multivariate models with at most two or three different time                    series.  This is a major drawback for most economic applications.               This grant will permit the investigator to continue the research                started under the previous grant on multivariate ARCH and                       cointegration analysis.  In addition the project develops and                   applies a new statistical procedure called common features to                   problems in economics and finance.  A conference will be held in                April, 1992 in La Jolla, California on new developments in                      volatility models and applications to finance.                                                                                                                  Economic time series have many distinctive characteristics.                     Generally, they exhibit serial correlation, trends, seasonality,                often heteroskedasticity, skewness, kurtosis, and various other                 features.  In order to detect each of these features in a data                  set, a variety of tests are available each of which takes the                   particular feature in question as the alternative to the null                   hypothesis that the feature is not present in the data.  Under                  its previous NSF grant, the investigator developed a new                        statistical procedure called common features that permits the                   analyst to determine if two or more data sets share the same                    distinctive characteristics.  This procedure was used to show                   that there was empirical evidence of a common international                     business cycle for the major industrial countries.  The procedure               will be extended and generalized.  It will be used to examine                   sectoral output in the U.S. to see whether sectors move together                over the business cycle.  The procedure will be used to determine               whether regions within the U.S. move together.  International                   data on capital markets will be analyzed to determine what                      features are common to the equity markets for several blocks of                 countries.  This research should provide new insights into the                  nature of the volatility in international capital markets.",
