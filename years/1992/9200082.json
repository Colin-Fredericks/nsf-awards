 "awd_abstract_narration": "Derelict land commonly found in metropolitan areas often fails to               support normal succession to woodland vegetation, for reasons that              are not known.  Restoration of diverse communities of native woody              plants on such sites is important because of the need to increase               habitat for wildlife and plant biodiversity, create corridors and               decrease distance between areas of natural habitat, support                     migratory birds, and provide opportunities for environmental                    education and recreation in densely populated urban areas.  We                  propose to test methods that may stimulate woody plant colonization             of closed landfills, an abundant type of derelict land, by planting             small patches of woody plants that can rapidly colonized the site.              We will experimentally determine the patch size site, and will test             a series of hypotheses concerning the causes for the inhibition of              natural succession.                                                             The study will be conducted on a recently closed landfill at Fresh              Kills, NY.  Patches of 7, 21, and 72 individuals of 7 species will              be created in a randomized block design.  Seed rain, recruitment                and survival of seedlings, and herbivory will be monitored in the               patches and on transects extending outward from each patch; these               studies will test hypotheses that dispersal and herbivory limit                 natural woody plant establishment.  Soil qualities, including                   organic matter, pools of N and P, N mineralization rae, root growth             and mycorrhizal infection, will also be monitored within the                    patches and transects, and will test hypotheses concerning below-               ground changes over time will permit testing of hypotheses                      concerning linkages among these processes.  By evaluating                       hypotheses regarding both above- and below-ground processes, we                 will be able to compare their relative importance during                        succession.  Subsequently, this project will result in design                   recommendations for restoration methods used on derelict land                   throughout the region.",
