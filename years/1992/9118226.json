 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protein kinases are ubiquitous enzymes that qare frequently                     involved in signal transduction processes.  The major focus of the              proposed work is to elucidate the roles that protein kinases may                play in photoregulated leaf development in plants.  A suite of                  partial cDNA clones from the garden pea have been sequenced and                 found to encode protein serine/threonine kinase homologs.                       Messenger RNA levels corresponding to the five cDNA clones                      accumulate differentially when pea seedlings are exposed to white               light.  Experiments are proposed to understand the photoregulated               expression of these putative kinase genes at the RNA and protein                level.  Full-length cDNA clones will be isolated and sequenced in               order to understand more fully the structure of the putative                    kinases.  The photoreceptor system(s) controlling mRNA accumulation             and gene transcription will be determined.  The polypeptides                    encoded by the pea cDNA clones will be isolated after expression                in bacteria and used to generate antibodies.  The antibodies will               be used to study the accumulation, distribution, and biochemical                properties of the protein kinases.  Transgenic tobacco plants                   expressing the pea cDNAs will be produced in order to understand                the potential role these enzymes play in the transduction of light              signals.",
