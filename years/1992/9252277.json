 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is general agreement that exploration of the physical                     world can be more effectively taught utilizing modern computer                  technologies. The ability of the computer to quickly acquire                    and analyze data will allow more time for the student to focus                  on the concepts being taught.  This project utilizes computer                   data acquisition, analysis, and scientific report writing to                    better teach concepts in the physics laboratory through                         cooperative and discovery modes of learning.The major                           instruments needed to accomplish the above aim are 14 computer                  stations with the necessary hardware and software to perform                    the functions of data acquisition, analysis and scientific                      report writing.A major goal of this project is to reach out to                  women and Native American students and make physics concepts                    more accessible to them by using cooperative and discovery                      modes of learning.There is a national effort in physics                         teaching to teach fundamental concepts using computers.                         Avoiding the emphasis on repetitious data acquisition will make                 the field more applicable to the student's needs and therefore                  more exciting.  There is the general realization that since the                 computer has become an indispensable tool for the practicing                    scientist, it must also be integrated into the teaching of                      physics.",
