 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although our understanding of the complexity of the microbial                   food web has increased tremendously over the past several                       years, there has been little appreciation to date of the                        effects of trophic dynamics on the regenration of nitrogen.                     Dr. Glibert's work to date leads us to believe that total                       nitrogen regeneration in a natural food web is greater than                     that contributed by the component popultions, and that this                     effect is a nonlinear function of macrozooplankton density.                     This hypothesis has important consequences for how we measure                   the regeneration of nitrogen, and implies that commonly-used                    size-fractionation techniques may lead to underestimates of                     total regeneration.  If the magnitude of this bias is large,                    even if only under certian conditions, then our perspective of                  the balance between \"new\" and \"regenerated\" nitrogen may also                   be biased.  In these studies Dr. Glibert and collaborators will                 use several newly-developed techniques to determine the                         magnitude of the effect of these interactions under a range of                  conditions and the major processes contributing to this effect.                 The significance of these studies lies in elucidating the                       complex role of macrozooplankton in controlling the                             regeneration of nitrogen and how their interactions with other                  components of the plankton food web regulate the flow of                        nitrogen.",
