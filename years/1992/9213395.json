 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are a                                      computer-based system used to capture,                                          manage, edit, manipulate, analyze, synthesize                                   and output geographically-referenced                                            information.  The objective of this workshop is                                 to convene selected researchers and                                             practitioners from academia, government and                                     industry to exchange information and ideas                                      relating to GIS technology, and to provide                                      guidelines for others using or considering the                                  use of this technology in geotechnical                                          engineering, especially in geotechnical                                         earthquake engineering.  The workshop will be                                   held in Atlanta, Georgia during the summer of                                   1992, at the Georgia Institute of Technology,                                   thereby benefiting by the presence on this                                      campus of the Center for Geographic                                             Information Systems and Spatial Analysis                                        Technologies.                                                                                                                                                   Rapid development of a variety of information                                   systems, resulting from the large demand to                                     implement this technology, has led to a                                         frequent failure to clearly distinguish between                                 GIS and other similar systems which do not                                      have the ability to integrate geographically                                    referenced data analytically.  In addition, the                                 inherent compatibility limitations between                                      systems have led to restricted usage of                                         databases and the software used to manipulate                                   them.  These potential problems will be                                         addressed at the workshop.",
