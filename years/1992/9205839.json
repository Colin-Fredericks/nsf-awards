 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research involves a combined sequence                         stratigraphic and diagenetic analysis of cyclic passive margin                  carbonates of the Middle to Late Cambrian Bonanza King Formation of             the southern Great Basin (California and Nevada).  The formation                ranges from 300 to 1350 meters and forms a westward-thickening                  wedge from craton margin to shelf-edge and base-of-slope facies.                The Bonanza King is composed of >200 meter-scale carbonate cycles               that provide a remarkable strip record of Middle to Late Cambrian               third-order relative sea-level oscillations.                                         Preliminary results suggest that four and a half third-order               sequences can be recognized and mapped out across the Bonanza King              platform.  Intervals of thick subtidal cycles appear to                         characterize the transgressive systems tracts, intervals of thin                peritidal cycles characterize the highstand systems tracts and thin             zone of peritidal cycles exhibiting evidence of sporadic exposure               probably manifest sequence boundary zones.  Intracyclic abundance               of early dolomite decreases systematically from craton margin to                outer platform.  Cycles in sequence boundary zones and upper                    highstand systems tracts are dominantly dolomite whereas cycles in              transgressive systems tracts and lower highstand systems tracts                 retain abundant limestone.                                                           The objectives of the research are fourfold: 1) Dissect the                internal anatomy of carbonate stratigraphic sequences using the                 excellent exposures, broad outcrop area and extraordinary cyclicity             of the Bonanza King Formation as the data base.  Predictable                    variations in cycle stacking patterns and cross-platform trends                 will be used to identify the component systems tracts and bounding              unconformities.  2) Develop a reliable Middle to Late Cambrian                  accommodation curve of comparison to other published curves to                  determine the degree of eustatic control on sequence development.               3) Document the effects of sea-level fluctuations of all                        frequencies on early diagenesis of Bonanza King carbonates. 4)                  Evaluate the textural, petrophysical and geochemical changes that               occur in early diagenetic facies during fluid-rock interaction                  throughout burial.                                                                   This study integrates the sequence stratigraphy with the sea-              level and diagenetic history recorded in the Bonanza King Formation             and is the first major attempt to decipher the diagenetic history               of early Paleozoic carbonates of the Cordilleran passive margin.",
