 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is the mathematical analysis of                  solutions of partial differential equations defined on surfaces                 or manifolds.  The work is intuitively geometric in that it seeks               to determine when smooth mappings between manifolds can be                      deformed into harmonic maps between the same manifolds.  The                    question can be rephrased in terms of parabolic partial                         differential equations where the deformation becomes the                        evolution of the solution in time.  Considerable work has been                  done on problems of this nature, especially in Euclidean space.                 It is known that solutions need not evolve for all time, a                      phenomenon commonly referred to a finite-time blow up.  In the                  present context, the known conditions which preclude blow up are                related to the dimension and sectional curvatures of the target                 manifold.  The best results are known for two dimensional                       manifolds.  In the present work, efforts will be made to                        establish global existence of the heat flow of harmonic maps with               boundary in higher dimensions and to understand the character of                singularities when they do occur.  A second objective is that of                understanding the boundary regularity of the heat flow for                      harmonic maps in higher dimensions.  Evidence suggests that the                 evolving solutions to the heat equation cannot first encounter                  singularities at the boundary.  This may be difficult to show in                higher dimensions, but there is reason to believe that a complete               analysis is possible in two and three dimensional manifolds.                         Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them.",
