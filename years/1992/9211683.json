 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymer science in this century has focused on the linear chain and             its derivatives such as star polymers, rings, combs, ladders, as                well as nonlinear extensions such as branched polymers and three                dimensional networks.  This is a proposal to explore the conversion             of molecules making up \"bulk\" polymers to two-dimensional forms                 analogous to sheets with thicknesses of \"oligomeric\" dimension.                 The principal investigators has already identified a possible                   synthetic pathway to achieve this goal but the methodology involves             the use of fairly complex precursors.  The work proposed here is                aimed primarily at the synthetic simplification of pathways for                 two-dimensional polymers.  Specifically it is proposed to follow                several approaches with different levels of complexity.  One                    approach involves the use of smectogens with biphenylic cores, and              another the use of living polymerization to construct the necessary             reactive oligomers.  Other synthetic pathways are similar to those              already developed in the principal investigator's laboratory using              enantiomerically enriched chiral precursors.  In the new approach,              the requirement of enantiomeric purity is relaxed and substituted               for the presence of several stereogenic centers.
