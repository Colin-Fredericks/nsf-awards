 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to grow metastable epitaxial heterostructures has                   driven efforts to fabricate many novel electronic devices.  Recent              breakthroughs in the heteroepitaxial growth of silicides such as                CoSi2 on the Si(100) surface have revitalized the search for a                  metal base transistor; however, many problems remain.  One of the               most critical problems at this time is the inability to grow high               quality epitaxial Si back on top of these films.  This proposal                 addresses this goal by taking a scientifically aggressive approach              in an attempt to use \"kinetic engineering\" to overcome the growth               problems associated with heteroepitaxy on silicide surfaces.                    \"Kinetic engineering\" is intended here to describe attempts to                  alter the kinetics of a nucleating film by modification of the                  surface geometric and/or electronic structure. This will be                     accomplished by using adsorbates, such as As, as surfactants and                controllably altering the surface topography of the substrate.                  %%%                                                                             This research will result in a better fundamental understanding of              the influence adsorbates have on the kinetics and energetics of                 evolving films in determining the resulting growth mode.  This                  understanding will provide a foundation for low temperature                     processing of thin film structures with a desired morphology.  This             research will provide tools needed for the pursuit of advanced                  devices such as the  metal base transistor and the three                        dimensional integration of silicon devices.",
