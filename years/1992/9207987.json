 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aims of this proposal are to identify the genes that regulate               formation of the anteroposterior (A/P) axis in the ectoderm of                  the frog, Xenopus laevis. The ectoderm gives rise to both neural                tissues (including the brain and spinal cord) and to non-neural                 tissues (such as the cement- and hatching glands). These tissues                are induced by signals arising from the mesoderm and by                         intraectodermal interactions. Previous results showed that the                  ectoderm acquired an A/P pattern many hours before terminal                     differentiation begins. Very little is known about the molecular                basis for this patterning in any vertebrate. This information is                crucial to understanding the early genetic events that regulate                 ectodermal patterning during vertebrate development. Two                        approaches to analyzing A/P ectodermal patterning will be taken.                1. The function of the gene Xhox.lab1 will be analyzed by                       misexpression and functional ablation. Xhox.lab1 is a novel                     homeodomain containing gene that is expressed in posterior                      ectoderm early during A/P patterning. 2. Other genes expressed                  soon after ectodermal induction will be isolated by subtractive                 hybridization between microdissected induced and uninduced                      ectoderm.",
