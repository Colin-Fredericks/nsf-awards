 "awd_abstract_narration": "This inservice program involves a partnership among                             planetary scientists, science educators, and teachers at the                    elementary and middle school level.  It is designed to : (a)                    provide education in astronomy and basic scientific                             principles for teachers and (b) provide teachers with the                       means to communicate these concepts in an inquiry fashion to                    students.  Since topics in space science are part of the                        elementary school curriculum from Kindergarten through                          eighth grade, providing teachers with knowledge of both                         concepts and teaching methods will enable them to provide                       hands-on experiences that will enhance the critical thinking                    skills of their students.  The program will involve teachers                    in four week long leadership workshops, follow up classes                       during the year, and close working relationships with                           scientists.  Included in the project will be the development                    of resource materials for teachers to share as they conduct                     two-day workshops for other elementary school teachers.                                                                                                         The cost sharing of the project will be at least twelve                         percent of the project.  If the project is enhanced by a                        grant from NASA the total cost sharing will become 53% of                       the project.",
