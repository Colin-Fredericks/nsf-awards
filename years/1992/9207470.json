 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eggs and embryos of several species of hydrozoans contain                   endogenous calcium indicators similar to aequorin. These                        preparations offer unique opportunities for studying the role of                calcium in early development. Two calcium transients, one at                    fertilization, and another at cleavage, are crucial for normal                  development. This project will employ photon counting techniques                and image intensified video microscopy methods to determine if                  the fertilization calcium transient is due to a calcium wave, and               microinjection experiments to determine what second messengers                  participate in its initiation and propagation. Cytokinesis in                   hydrozoans is slow and requires external calcium. Photon                        counting, fluorescent dye injection, and drugs will be used to                  investigate how the calcium transient during cytokinesis is                     regulated. Voltage dependent calcium channels first become                      functional about one hour after fertilization. These channels                   play a major role in rapid calcium influx but very little is                    known about the developmental events that lead to the onset of                  channel function. This project will define the factors that are                 responsible for initiating calcium channel function in                          hydrozoans. When calcium rises in the cytosol of cleavage stage                 embryos, calcium is simultaneously transported from the                         endoplasmic reticulum to the external medium. This project will                 identify the mechanism that mediates this calcium efflux.",
