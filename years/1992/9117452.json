 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for support of participants at a winter Gordon                  Conference on Sensory Transduction in Microorganisms.  The                      conference, which is anticipated to have 110-135 attendees, will                permit scientists from the United States and abroad to discuss                  recent developments and ideas regarding molecular mechanisms of                 sensory transduction in simple unicellular systems including                    bacteria, yeast, flagellates, and Dictyostelium.  Sessions will                 emphasize the emerging generalizations regarding chemosensory and               photosensory receptors, intramolecular transduction, intracellular              signal processing, and the response processes, ranging from                     flagellar or pseudopod modulation in tactic cells to gene                       expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.                        Homologies between microbial and higher animal signal transduction              components will be emphasized.                                                                                                                                  Sensory signal transduction is the key to the ability of an                     organism to perceive and respond appropriately to its environment.              The mechanisms by which microbes perceive and respond to                        environmental stimuli are fascinating in their own right, and                   crucial to the survival of microbial species.  In addition, they                provide important clues to mechanims whereby higher organisms, both             plant and animal, likewise perceive and respond appropriately to                environmental stimuli.",
