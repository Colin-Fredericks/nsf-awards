 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arizona State University will initiate a four-week, commuter                and residential, Early Alert Initiative Young Scholars project in               Mathematics which will offer enrichment activities for 60                       precollege students entering grade 8.                                                                                                                           The first two weeks of the program will take place on the Navajo                Reservation.  Participants will be introduced to the experimental               nature of mathematics.  The topics of number theory, discrete                   probability, graph theory, and combinatorics will be taught and                 used as experimental material.  The students will learn to write                computer programs to implement mathematical routines for use in                 checking conjectures.  Participants also will learn problem-solving             techniques.  Problems will be selected and collected from several               sources including the Hungarian publication, \"Matematika Lapok.\"                Various science activities will be correlated with the mathematical             focus.  For example, participants will learn about the mathematics              of lenses and will build a four-inch reflector telescope which will             then be used to explore the beautiful night sky above the Navajo                Reservation.                                                                                                                                                    Students will spend the last two weeks on the campus of the Arizona             State University, where they will be given the opportunity to meet              with science faculty members and to attend science demonstrations.              They also will meet with personnel from the admissions and                      financial aid offices.",
