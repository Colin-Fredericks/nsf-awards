 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research program is the investigation of                      various hydrodynamic effects on shape, speed, stability, and                    extinction limits of premixed gas flames.  Various modeling                     techniques will be employed to reduce the study of pertinent                    combustion systems to simple approximate problems tractable                     either analytically or numerically.  Specific study topics                      are: (1) large-scale dynamics of premixed flames propagating                    through isotropic systems of small-scale eddies and the                         associated cascade-renormalization concept of turbulent flame                   speed; (2) extinction limits of premixed flames propagating                     through a periodic and a randomized system of eddies; (3)                       intrinsic dynamics and pattern formation in premixed flames                     and the related questions of flame stabilization and                            nonadiabaticity; and, (4) effects of natural convection on the                  dynamics of auto-catalytic reaction fronts in liquid solutions                  and the related questions of premixed gas combustion.                                                                                                           Turbulent combustion is a very important area of practical                      interest; results of this work should influence the design of                   automotive, aircraft, and rocket engines as well as industrial                  combustion devices.  The efficient use of fuels and                             minimization of production of air pollutants via combustion                     processes are dependent on development of a good understanding                  of the fundamental issues addressed in this work.",
