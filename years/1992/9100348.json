 "awd_abstract_narration": "With a Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers, Dr.                    Susan A. Gelman will be able to continue to study the relations                 between language and thought in young children, uncovering                      principles that children use to structure knowledge and                         experience.  She has already discovered that children make use of               sophisticated strategies to organize knowledge at an earlier age                than traditional theories of development predict.  She discovered               this by developing new experimental techniques for use with                     preschool children (until recently a relatively neglected age                   group) and novel linguistic analyses of language and concepts.                  One representative finding from her laboratory is that children                 as young as two-year olds expect category members to share                      important, nonobvious similarities, such as internal parts.  They               infer that members of the same category (e.g., blackbird and                    flamingo) share underlying properties despite salient perceptual                dissimilarities between the category members.  In a sense, very                 young children act as if members of a category share an                         underlying \"essence.\"  This previously unsuspected ability                      contradicts a widely accepted view that children's concepts are                 limited to concrete, perceptual, and obvious qualities.  Gelman                 has proposed that children have an early capacity to look beyond                salient perceptual properties, that this capacity predates                      training in science, and that it serves as a mechanism for                      further cognitive development.  In addition to the developmental                implications, these results suggest a new way of thinking about                 categorization.  Traditional accounts in psychology define                      categories as static clusters of primarily superficial and                      obvious features.  In contrast, these findings indicate that                    hidden, nonobvious properties are psychologically important.                                                                                                    This work is important for several reasons.  It will provide                    basic information about the usual course of preschool conceptual                development, knowledge of which should provide educators with                   better ways to present information so that it can be grasped by                 children when they enter formal schooling.  The information can                 also be useful in giving early warning of developmental                         disabilities that manifest themselves only in very subtle ways in               preschoolers, so that intervention programs can be undertaken                   before the children become stigmatized as \"slow learners\" or some               such in school.  It will also assist in the professional                        development of a young scientist with the potential to become one               of the superstars of her field.",
