 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year of a three year continuing effort.                       This research is to study the feasibility of human-computer                     interaction through the use of on-line recognition of                           electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns.  A system that can identify,               on-line, which of several mental tasks a person is performing                   could provide an alphabet with which a severely disabled person                 can compose commands to devices like a wheel chair.  Most prior                 research has focused on recognition accuracy rather than on fast,               real-time responses.  The goals of this research are to                         characterize the limitations of current EEG recognition methods,                to increase the accuracy and decrease the computation time of EEG               recognition by use of a neural network approach, and to develop a               practical real-time method.  The performance of conventional                    methods and of neural network learning methods designed for high-               dimensional data will be compared.  Evaluations of feature and                  classifier characteristics will be based on classification                      accuracy, robustness and computation speed.  This project has                   relevance to the field of pattern recognition in general, and to                the neural network and human-computer interaction fields in                     particular.",
