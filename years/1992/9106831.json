 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary Biology has been studied in the California annual             plant Clarkia (Onagraceae) for four decades and the genus has                   provided a number of model systems in which to study the origin of              species, genetic variation in natural populations and, more                     recently, molecular evolution.  The molecular studies were                      initiated to determine the mode of origin of the duplicated                     cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) siozymes that are present              in 12 Clarkia species but absent in 12 others.  PGI catalyzes an                essential reaction in sugar metabolism.  To date, several PGI genes             have been partially sequenced.  They have remarkably complex                    structure with 19 exons (and 18 introns) so far identified encoding             about 88% of the PGI protein (483/550 amino acids), the largest                 number of exons known for any plant gene.  A gene encoding the                  chloroplast PGI isozyme from a different Clarkia has also been                  sequenced; it has a continuous open reading frame with no exons.                     During the current project, additional PGI genes encoding both             isozymes from clarkias with and without the duplication will be                 cloned and sequenced.  Evidence from the sequences will be used to              determine whether the duplication occurred early in the evolution               of genus and was retained in some lineages but lost in others or                whether it arose more recently.  Since duplicated PGIs characterize             species in four taxonomic sections but are absent in three other                sections, the evidence can be expected to resolve the phylogenetic              relationships among the sections, a problem that has remained                   refractory even though Clarkia has been studied intensively.  The               sequence evidence will also be used to compare the rate and amount              of divergence between the plastid and cytosolic PGIs.  The analysis             will contribute to understanding the mechanisms that generate                   molecular divergence and constitutes one of the few studies to date             of the evolution of plant nuclear genes encoding proteins.",
