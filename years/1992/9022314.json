 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central equatorial Pacific is a very large region with high                 primary production, which is hypothesized to support a                          substantial faction of global new production.  New production                   is important because of its link to the vertical flux of                        meterial from the upper to the lower ocean and the implied role                 of that link in how the ocean cycles radiatively-active gases                   (the greenhouse problem).                                                                                                                                       This project constitues a part of the US joint global ocean                     flux study (JGOFS) in the central equatorial pacific and seeks                  to answer some baic questions about the role of heterotrophic                   bacteria in the equatorial Pacific.  Heterotrophic bacteria are                 believed to be an important component of the equatorial pacific                 system as: 1. they are one of the predominant sinks of                          dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon; 2. they are nitrogen                     rich with a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 4.5; 3. they                      comprise a large portion of the biomass, and may at times be                    greater than the phytoplankton; and 4. they account for a large                 fraction of ammonium uptake in a number of marine systems.                      This project will examine the role of heterotrophic bacteria in                 nitrogen cycling in the equatorial pacific and will                             specifically measure bacterial production, biomass, and                         nitrogen uptake by bacteria.",
