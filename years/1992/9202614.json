 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed symposium will be held at the annual meeting of the                American Society of Zoologists, a broad based society which                     includes many developmental and evolutionary biologists. The                    proposed speakers are a group of developmental biologists who are               interested in development as an evolutionary process. The program               includes embryologists who study the embryos of closely related                 species with different larval forms, as well as geneticists and                 molecular biologists who compare genes governing the formation of               the body plan during embryogenesis in different species. There is               now evidence that embryonic changes can profoundly influence the                life history of a species, especially in producing different                    larval forms. As more becomes known about the genes governing                   embryonic development, it may be possible to identify                           evolutionary constraints present in the elaboration of an embryo.               One problem in this field has been lack of communication between                evolutionary and developmental biologists. This symposium is                    designed to generate discussion between scientists in different                 disciplines, by exposing this group of developmental biologists                 to a wide ranging audience. The interaction should generate                     renewed interest in how embryos develop, and in how developmental               changes may influence the evolutionary process.",
