 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator plans to make optical measurements of cloud               droplet size spectra and liquid water content (LWC) with                        simultaneous measurements of cloud and rain water composition,                  aerosol size spectra, and three dimensional winds at a marine                   site on the NW coast of Washington State.  By combining the                     droplet spectra and LWC with the other measurement the                          investigators will address both:  1) droplet and chemical eddy                  fluxes associated with interception of cloud water by vegetation                and 2) the relationship between droplet and CCN number                          concentration in the marine boundary layer.                                          Cloud droplet- cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) relationships               will be studied by comparing CCN concentrations (inferred from                  aerosol size spectra) in clear air to cloud droplet                             concentrations.  Vertical wind speed, LWC, and droplet                          concentration will be combined to produce eddy covariance                       estimates of integrated cloud droplet fluxes and the size                       dependence of droplet deposition velocity.   The measured cloud                 water eddy fluxes will be compared to calculated droplet                        sedimentation fluxes and cloud water interception by an                         artificial tree.  The chemical fluxes associated with rain will                 be compared to those associated with intercepted cloud water.                        Understanding droplet/chemical flux and CCN/droplet                        relationships is important for characterizing the chemical                      cycling of trace species between  the atmosphere and the                        biosphere and for understanding the response of climate to CCN                  cycling in the marine atmospheric.",
