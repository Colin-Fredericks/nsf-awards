 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project examines how elementary, high school,                     and college students develop intuitive conceptions about                        calculus--which in this case is broadly defined as the                          mathematics of change and variation.  The central assumption                    is that, from an early age, people develop models about how                     things change.  Mathematics instruction must build upon                         these intuitive models.  The method of investigation                            involves sequences of teaching interviews in which                              individual students are presented with problems about                           situations of change such as the motion of cars, flow of                        water, or plant growth.  They are given physical materials                      and software tools to help them experiment with the                             problems.  Researchers observe and videotape the ensuing                        discussion, use of materials, and student-constructed                           representations of the solution.  Subsequent analysis                           focuses on students' constructions of the problem, the ideas                    that guide their predictions, the resources they use, and                       the principles they generate to verify predictions and                          explanations.  The project's findings will help mathematics                     educators rethink the ways in which calculus is currently                       taught, as well as the age levels at which key calculus                         ideas are introduced.  Results will also feed directly into                     a major elementary mathematics curriculum, in the form of a                     curriculum strand about \"change.\"",
