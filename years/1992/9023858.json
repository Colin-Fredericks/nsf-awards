 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine bacteria are essential links in marine productivity and                  biogeochemical cycles.  Although the species composition of marine              bacteria is largely unknown, evidence suggests that most marine                 bacteria are members of the Purple bacteria phylum of the                       Eubacterial kingdom.  The phylum contains photosynthetic,                       heterotrophic, and lithotrophic bacteria.  Many members are capable             of either the oxidation or reduction of nitrogen and sulfur which               are extremely important in the marine environment.  This project                seeks to ascertain if a general relationship between RNA/DNA ratios             and growth rate exists for the Purple bacteria.  New evidence from              the marine Purple bacterium, Pseudomonas perfectomarina, indicates              that the relationship between RNA/DNA ratio and growth rate extends             to the low growth rates believed to occur in the ocean.                         Furthermore, the Ps. perfectomarina data is in agreement with the               RNA/DNA ratios measured on enteric bacteria at near maximal growth              rates.  However, it has not been widely established that this                   predictive relationship between RNA/DNA ratio and growth rate is                valid for other Purple bacteria over the complete range of growth               rates that can exist in the natural environment.  In order to                   expand the repertoire of rRNA probes that can be used to measure                microbial growth rate in the ocean, a five-step approach will be                undertaken to: 1) clone the marine rRNA genes and create marine                 rRNA promoter-reporter gene fusions to assess if there is                       regulation in a growth rate-dependent manner; 2) empirically                    measure the RNA-DNA ratio vs growth rate for six marine bacteria                (representing three subdivisions of the Purple bacteria) using                  previously established methods; 3) investigate the mechanisms                   controlling rRNA synthesis in the marine bacteria; 4) screen the                marine bacteria's genomes for the presence of novel genes                       regulating rRNA synthesis; 5) clone and sequence the 23 S rRNA                  subunit of each marine bacterium and identify species-specific                  regions which will be used to assay the in situ growth rate in                  seawater samples from the Southern California Bight.  If a general              relationship between RNA/DNA ratios and growth rates are found to               exist for these purple bacteria, investigators could routinely                  determine the presence and measure the growth rates of large                    numbers of Purple bacteria in natural samples. In conclusion, it is             extremely important for the future use of rRNA probes in the ocean              that the relationship between rRNA and growth rate be investigated.                                                                                             No other macromolecule can provide the genetic and metabolic                    information necessary to evaluate the growth rate of a single                   species of micro-organism in a complex assemblage without the risk              of contamination.",
