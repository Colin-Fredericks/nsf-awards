The                 areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the                         acquisition include the following:  1. Theoretical Studies of                   Molecular Structure and Reactivity.  The proposed research                      includes software development, accurate ab initio studies of                    conformational problems and weak interactions, and                              semiempirical studies of solvation effects and large                            organometallic systems.  2. Surface Analysis.  Spectroscopic                    studies of chromatographic of surfaces will be augumented with                  molecular modeling calculations.  3. Conformational Analysis                    using NMR.  Molecular modeling calculations will be used to                     generate three-dimensional structures of vitamin B12                            derivatives and neuropeptides from NMR-data.                                    %%%                                                                             The computational demands of modern chemical research require                   the proper computing system that would avoid wasteful                           bottlenecks by balancing a variety of computational                             capabilities with individual workstations, networks, hardware                   and software maintenance, support personnel and training in all                 areas of computational chemistry.  Many new insights into                       kinetics of chemical reactions can be developed through                         theoretical studies with use of mini supercomputers when the                    experimental data are inaccessible.",
