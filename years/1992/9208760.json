 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electron-transfer reactions of organic compounds in highly                      concentrated (1-10 M) redox solutions are investigated.                         Extensive use is made of microelectrode techniques to obtain                    quantitative transport and kinetics data in solutions                           containing molar-level concentrations of electroactive                          species.  Initial studies focus on several recently identified                  mass-transport phenomena, including accelerated transport                       rates resulting from homogeneous electron-transfer reactions.                   In addition to microelectrode techniques, phase-measurement                     interference microscopy and quartz-crystal microbalance                         methods are used to measure physical parameters of the                          electrochemical depletion layer.  Other emphases include                        developing a detailed description of the dependence of                          heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constants on                               concentration and the investigation of the dependence of                        coupled chemical reactions (including catalytic reactions) on                   local electric fields;  electrochemical reduction of ketones                    is studied in detail to determine the effects of high electric                  fields on reaction selectivity.                                                                                                                                 Commercial electrosynthetic processes are usually run in                        highly concentrated solutions since these give a better energy                  efficiency and higher throughput than do dilute solutions, but                  almost all laboratory electrochemistry is done in dilute                        solutions where variables are more easily isolated and                          interpreted.  By creating a fundamental framework for the                       properties of concentrated solutions, this work will make                       feasible a rational scale-up paradigm for electrochemical                       processes.                                                                                                                                                      This is an award under the joint Initiative on Electrochemical                  Synthesis sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the                  Electric Power Research Institute.",
