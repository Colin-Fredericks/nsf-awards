 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for the development of a technological literacy                 course, \"The Digital World\", to be stored on a CD ROM, for                      national distribution.  The course is designed to be completely                 portable; any faculty member with a Macintosh and a CD drive                    will be able to offer it.  In an effort to reach students who                   would not normally consider technologically oriented courses,                   the course has no prerequisites and will require no advanced                    mathematics.                                                                    The course will use a hands-on, active approach to learning.                    For example, the final project will include student involvement                 in a project such as designing simple tic-tac-toe-playing chips                 that compete against each other in a tournament on the last day                 of class. A prototype version of the course will be taught at                   Dartmouth College.  Feedback from students and faculty will be                  used to develop a second version, which will then be                            distributed on CD ROM.",
