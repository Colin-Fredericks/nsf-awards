 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biomineralized materials such as molluscan shells are complex                   lamellar aggregates of inorganic single crystals and biopolymers                that form at low temperature with exceptional strength and                      crystalline ordering.  The biosynthesis process gives and                       incredible regularity to 1) inorganic and protein structure at                  nanoscale (atomic) dimensions, and 2) the initiation and                        termination of growth at mesoscale  (is greater than                            approximately 0.1 microns) dimensions, thus generating the highly               ordered microlaminate composite formation that gives the                        resulting biomaterial its strength and flexibility.  This                       interdisciplinary research will investigate the fundamental                     chemical and stereochemical interactions which, at the molecular                level control such biologically mediated mineral nucleation and                 growth at both the nano- and mesostructure level.  Nucleation and               growth of inorganic phases will be carried out from solutions at                low temperatures and pressures on:  i) inorganic and biological                 mineral templates; ii) synthetic organic templates with optically               active groups and surface arrays of ionic sites similar to those                found on biopolymeric templating surfaces in vivo; and iii)                     biogenic templating polypeptides.  The proposed experiments will                use a novel combination of synthesis and characterization                       techniques, including polypeptide sequencing and synthesis to                   form structure directing templates, in situ atomic force                        microscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction.                             %%%                                                                             Nature's use of templating involves material growth from                        solutions at low temperatures and pressures, a process that is                  currently only poorly understood  and little used by materials                  scientists.  Increasingly, it is becoming apparent that these new               materials, which have been referred to as \"chemically bonded                    ceramics\", have exceptional flexural strength.  The proposed                    activity of this research is expected to lead to the development                of new methods for the low temperature synthesis of mechanically                superior and/or highly oriented materials using nanostructure                   design and synthesis techniques.  It is hoped that as more light                is shed on templating mechanisms involved, templating kinetics                  will be improved and template-directed materials synthesis can be               done on a faster time scale.                                                                                                                                    While the research will initially be centered around the                        mineralization processes of molluscs, which specifically involves               CaCO3 growth, all multicellular organisms appear to have evolved                with chemically similar tools for carrying out genetic control                  over mineral nucleation and growth.  We therefore expect that our               experimentation will increase insight on related areas of                       biomineralization, including bone growth.  By more fully                        realizing how mineralization is orchestrated in one particular                  species, the answers to more complex biomineralization problems                 will surely follow.  Implications of our results for the medical                field are foreseeable; bone nucleation growth is based on the                   same fundamental chemical and structural interactions as occurs                 in mollusc shells, except that the nucleating macromolecules are                part of a bilipid membrane which encloses the mineralization                    space.  Thus, the study of hydroxyapatite nucleation onto such                  lipid  bilayer surfaces may follow.  On the other hand, a greater               understanding of soluble growth inhibitors can be useful for the                prevention of undesirable crystal growth.  Medical examples                     include dental plaque, organ stones, hardening of the arteries,                 and calcification of implanted heart valves.  In industrial                     cooling systems, oil recovery systems, and municipal water                      supplies, undesirable water-formed scale deposits of CaCO3 and                  CaSO4 foul treatment facilities.  New organic compounds may                     inhibit scale formation, be cost effective, and be useful over a                larger range of temperatures, pH, and salinity.",
