 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent work on quantum mechanics has focussed on the measurement                problem.  Because processes used to prepare systems in specifiable              quantum mechanical states are similar to measurements, it is                    commonly thought that preparations also suffer from a similar                   \"preparation problem.\"  Little work has previously been done on                 preparations, however, or on this apparent preparation problem.                 Recently, Dr. Wessels has shown that there is no preparation                    problem strictly analogous to the measurement problem.  Two                     problems, roughly similar to the measurement problem do arise,                  however, when some of the processes generally assumed to be                     preparations are analyzed quantum mechanically.  A rough analysis               of several examples suggests some ways one of these problems might              be solved.  One goal of this project is to work out these                       suggestions in detail, to see whether they work.  Another is to                 clarify the difficulties encountered in trying to solve the second              problem.  Also, Dr. Wessels is undertaking a survey of physics                  literature to determine what types of processes are currently being             used for preparation.  She is analyzing processes representative                of these types to see if they also suffer from the two problems,                and for those that do, she is seeking solutions.  She is also                   addressing related issues and is exploring further the connection               between preparation and measurement.",
