Activities in the four-week summer camp include intensive                       instruction in mathematics, communication skills, and                           computer science and analytical skills usable in developing                     research oriented science projects.  Students ar exposed to                     career exploration activities such as science projects.                         Students are exposed to career exploration activities such                      as field trips to industries, government laboratories and                       college research labs complete with pre-tour briefing, post-                    tour evaluations and informal meetings with scientists,                         along with mentoring by college role models.
