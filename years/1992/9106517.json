 "awd_abstract_narration": "Members of the Dioptinae, a tropical subgroup of the Notodontidae               or \"Prominent moths,\" exhibit many unique features. First,                      dioptines are the only prominents with brightly-colored wing                    patterns, and whose members fly in the day rather than at night.                Second, the caterpillars of many dioptines feed on toxic plants                 such as \"passion vine\" and \"pipevine.\"  In contrast, the larvae of              other prominents feed on trees, most of which do not contain                    toxins. Recent work has shown that dioptines are highly specialized             notodontids.  Parallels can therefore be drawn between the                      Dioptinae and the butterflies, which are also thought to have                   evolved from a drab, nocturnal, moth-like ancestor.  The major goal             of this proposal is to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the              Dioptinae based on comparative morphology of adult and larval                   stages.  The dioptine phylogeny will then serve as a framework for              a new classification, and will also be used to examine two                      questions:  First, when did toxic plant-feeding evolve in the                   Dioptinae? Second, when did day-flying behavior evolve?",
