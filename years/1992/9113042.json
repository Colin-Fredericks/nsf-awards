 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Lawrence Fagg and several others of the                     Catholic University of America (CUA) to collaborate with Achim                  Richter and other physicists at the superconducting electron                    accelerator facility of the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the                 Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. Several years ago                  the CUA group designed and built what was then the only low                     energy 180 degree electron scattering system in the world.  It was              installed at the Microtron Facility of the University of Illinois at            Urbana-Champaign and operated successfully to obtain data on ten                nuclei ranging from Carbon-13 to Gallium-71.  However, in 1990                  the Microtron Facility was shut down, terminating a very                        productive line of nuclear research.  The CUA group arranged to                 ship the scattering system to Darmstadt, Germany for installation               and use there.                                                                                                                                                  The support provided by this award will enable the CUA group to                 travel to Germany to complete the installation and testing of the               scattering system over the next few months.  Then they will be                  able to begin a series of collaborative experiments using the system            to study low multipolarity magnetic transitions in several selected             nuclei, including Helium-3, Neon-21, and Krypton-86.  The system                they built has a unique capability for investigating such transitions           as well as ground-state magnetic structure.",
