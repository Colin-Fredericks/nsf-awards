 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of 3-manifolds is often enriched by imposing extra               structure on the manifold:  geometric structure such as a                       Riemannian metric of negative curvature, or topological-dynamical               structure such as a flow or lamination.  The two investigators                  will continue research into 3-manifold supporting laminations and               pseudo-Anosov flows.  They will also undertake new research into                the structure of 3-manifolds and more general spaces which are                  not negatively curved.  In a joint project, Mosher and Oertel                   will explore a new technique for analyzing such spaces.  Any such               space can be made to support a certain kind of 2-dimensional                    measured lamination.  The properties of this lamination will be                 studied and used in an attempt to shed light on the general                     structure of these spaces.  In a separate project, Mosher will                  continue a study of Thurston's homology norm for a 3-manifold,                  and techniques for computing this norm using pseudo-Anosov flows.               He will also pursue a computer study of ends of hyperbolic 3-                   manifolds.  In still another separate project, Oertel will                      continue research into a class of 3-manifolds called laminated                  manifolds.  The first goal is to extend methods and theorems from               the well-known class of Haken manifolds to the larger class of                  laminated manifolds.  The second goal is to show that, in some                  sense, \"most\" 3-manifolds are laminated.                                             It is a surprising fact that, although we live in a three                  dimensional space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so are blessed                   with a natural intuition about such geometric objects, in the end               this does not carry us as far as we might have expected, for                    questions which have been settled by algebraic calculations for                 higher dimensional manifolds still remain baffling in the 3-                    dimensional case.  The most famous of these is the celebrated                   conjecture of Poincare from around the turn of the century                      concerning 3-dimensional spheres, where precisely the original 3-               dimensional case is the only one still open.  The investigators                 are pursuing a variety of questions about 3-dimensional                         manifolds, some with slightly strange notions of distance on                    them, so-called hyperbolic metrics, but time and time again these               questions have been shown to have clear relevance to the case of                manifolds with a more familiar notion of distance.",
