 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to use the most advanced                      computing environments and the most efficient computational                     techniques available to study the long term dynamics of normal                  and abnormal electrical activity in heart tissue.  A patch of                   heart tissue is modeled as a two- or three-dimensional grid of                  cells the electrochemical activity in each cell being modeled by                systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODE) and                  with resistive coupling between each pair of cells.                                                                                                             We propose to directly simulate a nonlinear partial differential                equation (PDE) formulation of the system  to examine the long                   term dynamical behaviors such as frequency entrainment in                       pacemaker sinus cells, the development and propagation of                       arrhythmias in the normally quiescent atrial cell tissue and the                interaction of the normal pacemaking activity and abnormal atrial               ectopic beats in combined sinus node-atrial tissue.                                                                                                             The solution of the system of coupled ODEs have been approximated               using an explicit numerical integration method on both the CM-200               and CM-5 Connection Machines but due to the stiffness of the                    equations, we have been restricted to medium length simulations                 of two-dimensional long-time simulations of both the PDE and ODE                formulations.                                                                                                                                                   This research will not only advance the current state-of-the-art                in scientific computing, but will also further our understanding                of cardiac dynamics under both normal and abnormal conditions.",
