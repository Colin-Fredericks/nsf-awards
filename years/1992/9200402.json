 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Psychobiology at the             University of California, Irvine to continue to sponsor a                       successful undergraduate research experience in Neural Plasticity               and Brain Function.  The program originated with a one-week                     undergraduate Summer Institute that was expanded with NSF funding.              The eight-week summer program begins with a one-week                            lecture/seminar series designed to introduce the students to the                field and to the research of the various faculty.  This is followed             by an active research experience in faculty laboratories on a                   defined project tailored to the goals of the student and their                  advisors.  Throughout this period, students continue to interact                with faculty in both formal and informal meetings.  At the end of               the program, students present their findings to other students in               the Department and to the faculty.",
