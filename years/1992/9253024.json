 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parasitic nematodes are important world health and agricultural                 problems yet are very difficult to study.  As a paradigm, we propose            to identify acetylcholine receptor subunit genes from the important             human parasitic nematode Onchocerca volvulus using DNA sequence                 knowledge that we have derived for the equivalent receptor subunits             from the laboratory nematode C. elegans.  Acetylcholine receptor                mutants of C. elegans are viable and three receptor subunit genes               have already been sequenced.  Using monoclonal antibodies raised                against purified receptor subunits, PCR, or reduced stringency                  hybridization, any remaining C. elegans submit gene will be identified.         Identification of all subunits needed to make a receptor will be                confirmed by in vitro expression in frog oocytes.  Based on the set of          C. elegans sequences, and Onchocerca cDNA library will be amplified             with degenerate PCR primers.  PCR primers products will be identified           by  sequencing and used to isolate cDNA clones.  Parasite receptor              function will be reconstructed first by expressing the parasite receptor        in frog oocytes from in vitro RNA transcripts and then fy transforming          C. elegans receptor mutant strains with expressible Onchocerca cDNA             constructs.  Our approach should identify all subunit genes needed to           reconstruct a completely homologous Onchocerca acetylcholine                    receptor.  Our model should provide a rationale to develop a                    transgenic strains or expression systems for other receptor or cuticular        proteins that might be useful in devising drug or immunotherapies               against parasitic nematodes.",
