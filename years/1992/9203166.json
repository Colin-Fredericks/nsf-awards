The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support an twelve-month postdoctoral research visit             by Dr. Theodore L. Anderson to work with Professor Jost                         Heintzenberg of Stockholm University.                                                                                                                           The Counterflow Virtual Impactor (CVI) is a well-established                    device for collecting liquid hydrometeors.  Unlike other cloud                  water collectors, the CVI should perform equally well in cirrus                 (ice) clouds, allowing microphysical data to be collected which                 could help to resolve such fundamental questions as whether cirrus              act as a positive or negative feedback in greenhouse-gas-induced                climatic warming.                                                                                                                                               A key goal of this project will be to characterize and develop a                method of controlling the collection of large hydrometeors by the               CVI.  Other goals include (a) improving the overall CVI sampling                and analysis system so as to lower the detection limits for both                condensed water and hydrometeor number concentration and (b)                    optimizing all instruments for the low pressure cirrus environment.                                                                                             The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel, a stipend for twelve months and a dependents' allowance.",
