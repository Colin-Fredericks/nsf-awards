Shah, to collaborate with                                 members of the Department of Civil Engineering                                  of the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt, Germany,                                directed by Professor Gert Koenig.  They are                                    joining their resources and expertise in                                        experimental research to determine the factors                                  that influence the strain softening response of                                 concrete in uniaxial compression and tension.                                   The research plan combines the expertise of TH                                  Darmstadt in large-scale structural testing and                                 design with the knowledge of materials science                                  being developed at the Center for Advanced                                      Cement-Based Materials.                                                                                                                                         Recent advances in concrete technology have made                                it possible to make concrete with compressive                                   strength more than double that of normal                                        strength concrete.  This high strength concrete                                 is used more and more in current construction,                                  because of perceived beneficial characteristics,                                but there is growing evidence that it is being                                  used improperly in some cases.  The increased                                   strength is due in part to an improved bond                                     between the cement-based matrix and aggregate in                                concrete.  However this improved bond makes the                                 high strength concrete more brittle than normal                                 concrete.  The failure mechanisms are poorly                                    understood.  Different failure mechanisms result                                in different strain softening response.  A                                      better understanding of the strain softening                                    response will help to define the appropriate use                                of this new material.",
