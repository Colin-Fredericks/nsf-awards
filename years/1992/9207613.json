 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a travel grant in support of a research workshop in the            area of queueing networks with finite capacity.  This will be the               second international workshop ever to be held on this important topic,          and it will take place at IBM Research Triangle Park (RTP), North               Carolina, on May 28-29, 1992.  The subject matter of this workshop              deals with performance modelling of finite resources as used in                 computer systems, computer communication networks, and flexible                 manufacturing systems.  In recent years, there have been significant            advances in the state-of-the-art in this area.  However, not enough             time is allocated to this topic at the regular meetings of the                  relevant professional societies.  The objectives of this workshop               are:                                                                                                                                                                      o  to provide the opportunity to researchers who work in                                                                                                           this area to present their latest research                                                                                                                   o  to foster cooperation between researchers, minimize                             unnecessary duplication, and identify new long-term                             research objectives                                                                                                                                          o  to educate or bring up-to-date other researchers who                            work in the other areas of computer and communication                           performance modelling                                                                                                                                        o  to provide a comprehensive set of proceedings (the second                       in this research area).",
