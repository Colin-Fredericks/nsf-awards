 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three-year study of reworked volcaniclastic              deposits in the Eocene Challis volcanic field in central Idaho.                 The project focuses on two major goals.  The first is                           identification of changes in sedimentation style and pattern that               result from different types of volcanic eruptions.  The second goal             is analysis of bias in the sedimentary record of volcanism.                          Deposits of the Challis volcanic field represent a long period             of volcanic activity (51 to 40 million years ago) characterized by              an initial period of predominantly non-explosive intermediate                   volcanism followed by caldera-forming volcanism.  The sedimentary               system associated with this volcanism comprises high - and low -                 sinuosity streams, lakes (claystone - tuff and turbidite                       components), and debris - flow aprons deposited by lahars.  The                 study will identify the signal of different eruption types in a                 diverse assemblage of depositional environments.  The study will                also identify which environments are most sensitive to perturbation             by eruption and therefore, contain the best record of volcanic                  activity.                                                                            The study is field - oriented, combining lithostratigraphy,                tephra fingerprinting, and petrofacies stratigraphy to produce the              detailed correlation framework needed to achieve the projects                   goals.  These methods require measurement of detailed stratigraphic             sections, sandstone, diamictite, and conglomerate petrology, and                chemical analyses of fallout tuffs in the sections.",
