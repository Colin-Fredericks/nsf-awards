 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate both single hop and multihop                architectures for terabit networks.  The approaches will exploit                the characteristics of WDM lightwave technology so that efficient               protocols and easily-reconfigurable architectures can be developed.             For single-hop systems,  the PI will examine both                               control-channel-based and non-control-channel-based protocols and               integrate packet-switched protocols as well as mechanisms to                    accommodate circuit-switched traffic.  The approaches will employ               realistic assumptions on optical component characteristics (e.g.,               nonzero transceiver tuning times), and they will be aimed at                    supporting a multiuser base (possibly 1000's) which can be                      time-varying scalable.  For multihop architectures, the PI will                 investigate optimal node placement in regular structures to suit                nonuniform traffic conditions.  In  addition, he will study dynamic             reconfiguration algorithms of the embedded virtual network topology             to combat changes in the offered traffic conditions and explore                 alternative multihop architectures for suitability of application               to optical networks.  The PI will also consider if various                      single-hop and multihop systems can be compared in a meaningful                 fashion (assuming equivalent system parameters).  He will try to                develop techniques which will to understand under what                          circumstances a given architecture may be considered superior to                others.",
