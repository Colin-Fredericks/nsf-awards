 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research relates to a new class of polymers, functionalized                polyolefins, which have unique molecular (comb-like) structure.                 The functional group is located at the end of the side chain with               several flexible methylene spacers.  This type of polymer could be              a very useful material, not only in the sense of having mobile                  primary functional groups to interact with other materials, but                 also because many of the desirable physical properties of                       polyolefins-such as crystallinity, thermal stability, and                       processibility-are preserved.                                                                                                                                   The chemistry involved in preparing this type of functional                     polyolefin involves borane monomers and transition-metal catalysts,             such as Ziegler-Natta and olefin metathesis catalysts.  Borane                  monomers are generally stable to transition-metal catalysts and are             polymerizable to high-molecular-weight polymers.  In turn, the                  borane groups in these polymers are easily converted to other                   functional groups under mild conditions to polyalcohols.  This new              functionalization chemistry will include:  (1) a systematic study               of borane monomers which are polymerizable with transition metal                catalysts; (2) the extension of this functionalization chemistry to             polyolefins containing amino and halide groups; (3) a new synthetic             route to prepare telechelic polymers with functional groups at both             ends of the polymer chain; (4) the utilization of reactive                      polyolefins to prepare other new classes of materials, such as                  block and graft polyolefin copolymers; (5) the application of                   functionalized polyolefins to immobilize catalysts for chemical                 processes; (6) the evaluation of functionalized polyolefins in                  polymer blends and alloys.  This study will be a colloboration with             Dr. Charles C. Han of the National Institute of Standards and                   Technology.                                                                                                                                                     Overall, the goals are not only to extend this functionalization                chemistry, but also to study the potential of applying these                    research findings to the preparation of materials with novel                    properties.",
