 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Professors Arveson and Wolf is made under the                Mathematical Sciences Research Group initiative.  It will support               postdocs and graduate students in Modern Analysis at the                        University of California at Berkeley.  The research supported by                this award will deal with various aspects of Modern Analysis                    including the representation theory of Lie groups, the theory of                operator algebras, and ergodic theory.                                               As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries                  inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has               had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in                  analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics,                       especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.                   The theory of operator algebras begins with the notion of                       operator, which can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices                of complex numbers.  Special types of operators are often put                   together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.                   These abstract objects have a surprising variety of applications.               For example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn                 is  currently being used to study the structure of DNA, and they                are of fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which                 is becoming increasingly important in physics.  Ergodic theory in               general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems                  whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in                  microscopic detail.  Under the heading \"dynamics can be placed                  the modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act                 on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory makes contact with                geometry in its quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.",
