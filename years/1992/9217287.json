 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides support for a collaborative research project                between materials science and computer science to develop and                   implement massively parallel algorithms for modeling the structure              of liquids and liquid-solid interfaces.  The grant is funded                    equally by the Divisions of Materials Research and Advanced                     Scientific Computing through the Computational Approaches to Real               Materials program which itself is part of the High Performance                  Computing and Communications Initiative.                                                                                                                        The development of novel, massively parallel computers has opened               new avenues for the application of electronic structure codes to                complex materials systems.  New codes will be implemented which                 will take full advantage of parallel machines to examine the                    structure and electronic properties of liquids and liquid-solid                 interfaces.  Currently, these systems, in particular the liquid-                solid interface, are not accessible to ab initio methods.  The                  research will employ molecular dynamics simulations using quantum               forces determined from ab initio pseudopotentials.  Our first                   effort will focus on liquids involving tetrahedral semiconductors.              We will calculate the electronic, structural and dynamical                      properties of the elemental liquids such as silicon and simple                  compounds such as gallium arsenide.  With respect to the liquid-                solid interface, we will examine the structural and dynamical                   properties of the interface during the melting process.                         %%%                                                                             This research will develop and implement computer programs for the              new generation of parallel computers in order to study the                      structure and electronic properties of liquid semiconductors and                their interface with solid semiconductors.  This work has important             ramifications in the processing of semiconducting materials, in                 addition to its fundamental physical interest.  The work will also              develop new computer algorithms which will have importance in many              fields of science.  The research is funded jointly by the Divisions             of Materials Research and Advanced Scientific Computing through the             High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative.",
