 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is directed at improved understanding                and prediction of atmospheric variability with time scales longer               than a week.  This 'low-frequency variability' is generated by                  external forcing (as in the annual cycle), dynamical processes                  internal to the atmosphere such as blocking, and by interactions                between the atmosphere and the underlying media (primarily the                  oceanic mixed layer and the land-surface hydrology).  The research              involves the diagnosis of observational data sets using statistical             techniques such as compositing, digital filtering, principal                    component analysis, singular value decomposition, and cluster                   analysis.  Results are interpreted in light of the current                      theoretical understanding of weather and climate systems.  The                  research will address (1) detection and interpretation of                       interannual and interdecadal climate variability in Northern                    Hemisphere temperature and pressure fields, (2) nonlinear aspects               of low-frequency variability including the question of whether the              Northern Hemisphere winter circulation exhibits distinct                        'circulation regimes' manifested in truly bimodal frequency                     distributions, (3) relationships between patterns of sea-surface                temperature anomalies observed in different seasons and in                      different parts of the world ocean, (4) some poorly understood                  aspects of the climatological mean annual cycle and (5) systematic              errors in extended-range numerical weather prediction.  This                    research is important because it seeks to improve our understanding             of weather and climate processes and hence has the potential for                improving our ability to predict weather and climate.",
