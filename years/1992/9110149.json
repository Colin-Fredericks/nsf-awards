Project                  funding will enable travel and a four-month site visit at Florida               State for the co-investigators, Dr. T.N. Krishnamurti (Forida                   State) and L.J. Ogallo (University of Nairobi), to prepare an                   Atlas of Recent African Climate, covering the period 1979-1990.                 This effort will expand and update an Atlas recently published by               the co-PIs that covered the climate of the continent over the                   five-year period 1980-1984.  The data for each of the 144 months                for the following variables will be processed: tropospheric                     winds, temperature, humidity, geopotential heights, sea level                   pressure, sea surface temperature, vegetation index, rainfall                   distribution and the field of the outgoing longwave radiation.                  The Atlas will include sections on data quality, data validation,               data analysis and detailed sections on the interpretation of the                monthly mean fields, anomalies and intra-seasonal and inter-                    annual variability.  Once completed, the data sets will all                     reside on diskettes and tapes and will become available to young                scientists at the University of Nairobi.                                                                                                                        This project in climate modeling fulfills the program objective                 of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the                    United States and Kenya to combine their expertise and pool                     research resources to improve the ability to predict severe                     droughts and to monitor climate change.",
