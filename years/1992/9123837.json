 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to develop solid membranes                    for the purposes of separating mixtures of gases and for the                    transport of metal ions.  The proposal extends and builds on                    research the PI has been undertaking in this area over the                      past several years, and which has been funded by two NSF                        grants (CBT-8611646 (1986-1989) and CTS-8912634 (1989-1992)).                   The most recent grant (CTS-8912634) examined two processes, a                   separation of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen, and a                         separation of copper ion from iron and nickel.  The first                       process was not successful, but high selectivity was obtained                   for the separation of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen by                     using a polyvinylammonium thiocyanate membrane.  In a set of                    careful experiments, the PI demonstrated that the mechanism                     for this selectivity is the reaction of ammonia with the                        thiocyanate moiety attached to the polymer backbone.  This                      reaction produces ammonium thiocyanate, a salt in which                         ammonia is very soluble.  Additional ammonia then dissolves in                  the salt, and diffuses across this membrane through the salt.                   Unfortunately, the selectivity decreases as the temperature                     increases (presumably because of the lower solubility of                        ammonia in the salt), and these membranes are not useful at                     the high temperatures of industrial interest in ammonia                         synthesis.                                                                                                                                                      The proposal suggests two studies.  The first is again an                       ammonia separation.  The PI has begun to investigate                            persulfonic acid membranes.  He has found that these retain a                   sixty to one selectivity of ammonia to nitrogen at the high                     temperatures of relevance to ammonia synthesis.  The new                        proposal suggests characterizing the selectivity of these                       membranes in more detail, and identifying the mechanism of                      selectivity.  The second study is concerned with developing                     membranes for the selective and rapid transport of lithium                      ion.  Such membranes can play a crucial role in the design of                   a rechargeable lithium battery.",
