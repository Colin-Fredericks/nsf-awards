 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at elucidation of the means by which                     the five operons which comprise the sn glycerol 3-phosphate (glp)               regulon of Escherichia coli are negatively controlled by the                    proteins encoded by the glpEGR  operon.  The glpR gene encodes a                repressor protein which interacts specifically with operator sites              on DNA in each of the operons of the regulon.  The glpE- and glpG-              encoded proteins are needed together with the repressor to achieve              efficient repression.  This type of regulatory system containing                three components has not been described previously in prokaryotes.              Results of the proposed research will provide molecular details                 regarding the interaction of repressor with operator DNA, and will              reveal the roles of the GlpE and G1pG proteins in repression.  In               addition, the mechanism of action of the repression system in each              of the operons of the regulon will be defined in greater detail.                Specifically, the role of repressor-mediated DNA looping and of                 integration host factor (IHF) will be determined.  The objectives               will be achieved by using genetic and biochemical approaches.  The              structure and function of the DNA-binding domain of the repressor               will be studied through characterization of altered forms of the                repressor generated by site-directed mutagenesis.  The roles of                 G1pE in repression will be determined by isolation and                          characterization of mutants altered in G1pE and/or G1pG action, and             by isolation and characterization of the G1pE and G1pG proteins.                The role of IHF-binding sites and of additional potential operators             in repression will be defined by determining repression in mutants              deficient in IHF, and by identification of these sites on the DNA.              All of the results will provide molecular details regarding the                 mechanism of action of this \"three-component\" regulatory system.                This knowledge will shed light on how the cell uses specific DNA-               protein interactions to respond to changes in the supply of                     nutrients.",
