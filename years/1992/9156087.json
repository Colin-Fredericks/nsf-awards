 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biology teaching should incorporate the process of scientific                   inquiry, not just the information resulting from it. Only by                    involving students directly in scientific experimentation and                   intellectual debate can they be expected to develop the                         fundamental understanding of biology required for biological                    literacy. Engaging students in this process demands a classroom                 that motivates learning, teaches analytical skills as well as                   information, and captures the spirit of curiosity and                           questioning.  To meet these demands for the broadest spectrum                   of students we will address three objectives.  First, we will                   design and evaluate simple, low-cost experimental exercises                     that illustrate fundamental biological principles and can be                    conducted in an introductory course without a laboratory.                       Second, we will construct a set of exercises in scientific                      study skills that will address the difficulty, shared by many                   college students, of learning scientific material. The                          innovative aspect of our approach to study skills is that we                    will teach them in a forum that is tightly coupled with the                     biology instruction, which will provide for exchange between                    the biology instructor and the study skills instructor.                         Finally, drawing on cooperative learning approaches that are                    highly effective in other fields, we will develop exercises                     that can be used to involve all members of small or large                       classes in active thinking and learning. The product of this                    project will be a published manual that will explore the                        philosophy of building community in the classroom and will                      describe the exercises in experimentation, study skills, and                    cooperative learning that can be incorporated into                              introductory-level biology curricula.",
