 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is attempting to engineering a bacterium, using no                 more than currently available technology, intro an intracellular,               seed-transmissible endosymbiont that functions as a plant                       'organelle'.  The approach is based on a screen designed to select              directly for endosymbiosis.  An SGER would allow us to test the                 feasibility of the method.  We will construct Bacillus subtilis Kan             (kanamycin-resistant) Hyg (hygromycin-resistant) Gus (B-                        glucuronidase); derive L-forms from it; introduce these into                    tobacco protoplasts; select for callus simultaneously resistant to              Kan on the presence of endosymbiotic 'organelles'.  If this proves              feasible, it would permit a full-scale research project to develop              conditions for optimization of selection and regeneration of                    endosymbiotic callus into whole plants.  Several arguments suggest              the approach is feasible in principle.  These include not only the              straightforward selection and simple technology, but also the large             number of endosymbioses found in nature, and particularly the                   reports of laboratory-induced endosymbiosis in Amoeba and plant                 cells.                                                                          %%%                                                                             Organelle engineering would allow plants to be equipped with                    agronomically valuable metabolic and physiological capabilities                 that are too complex to be introduced by gene transfer, would also              provide a practical system for system endosymbiosis in the                      laboratory.",
