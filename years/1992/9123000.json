 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                        metallic Chemistry Program, is for the support of studies of                    the photochemistry of excited states of two types of rhenium                    complexes in which the rhenium atom has six d-electrons.  In                    the first case the complex will contain a bidentate diimine                     ligand that serves as an electron acceptor in the excited state                 and a monodentate ligand that serves as an electron donor in                    the excited state, and which is reactive in its electron                        deficient form.  Photochemical excitation of these molecules                    will generate a ligand-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) excited                    state.  Objectives of this phase of the investigation include:                  1) delineation of the photochemical reactions that occur                        andidentification of reactive intermediates produced via LLCT                   excitation, 2) determination of the kinetics of rearrangements                  and bond fragmentations of the reactive groups, and 3)                          utilization of the rate constants obtained in 2) to determine                   the effects of structural and energetic factors on the lifetime                 of the LLCT excited state.  In the second case, sigma-to-pi                     antibonding excitation processes in rhenium(I) complexes that                   contain bidentate diimine and alkyl ligands will be examined.                   Here the results of bond scission in the excited state will                     produce metal- and carbon-based radicals.  A primary objective                  of this work is to relate rhenium-carbon bond strength to the                   rate of excited state bond fragmentation.                                       %%%                                                                             Charge transfer in photochemically generated excited states is                  a fundamental aspect of biological light energy harvesting                      systems.  How charge transfer states are sufficiently                           stabilized in biological systems so that productive reactions                   occur faster than charge recombination is a mystery that                        continues to stimulate exciting research.  Successful emulation                 of biological systems could mean more efficient utilization of                  solar energy for technological purposes; determination of the                   reactivity of the excited state in systems such as those to be                  examined here may be useful in this regard.  The chemical                       systems under study may also be useful as photochemically                       activated catalysts for polymerization reactions.",
