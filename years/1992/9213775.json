 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation Dr. Sally                     McBrearty will conduct archaeological research in the Baringo Basin             region of Kenya. In particular she will focus on the Kapthurin                  Formation in the Tugen Hills. Previous archaeological research in               the area has yielded a stratified sequence of archaeological sites              as well as a small amount of hominid (human) skeletal material.                 Building on previous work done by a Belgian team she will conduct               archaeological, geological and paleontological prospecting and                  mapping. Limited excavation will also be carried out. Sediment                  samples will be collected to determine age by means of argon                    dating. Geochemical fingerprinting will serve to check on field                 stratigraphic correlations and x-ray fluorescence analysis will                 provide a technique to provenience surface fossils whose                        stratigraphic position is unclear. Dr. McBrearty will use stone                 artifacts and archaeological fauna in an attempt to reconstruct                 human behavior. A number of techniques, including soil carbonate                analysis will be employed to understand the fluxuating environment              to which these hominids adapted.                                                                                                                                While a number of lines of evidence - archaeological,                           paleontological and genetic - suggest that anatomically modern                  humans first appeared in sub Saharan Africa just when and where                 this occurred is unknown. What interests paleoanthropologists most              however is the process which lead to this emergence and here also               little evidence is available. Dr. McBrearty's research will address             this issue. Information to date suggests that the transition took               place during the Middle Pleistocene and the Kapthurin Formation                 encompasses this time period. Prior work indicates that it contains             archaeological materials and fauna as well as human remains. Dr.                McBrearty's work will increase this data base and bring a wide                  range of modern scientific techniques to bear in order to make                  interpretations.                                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons. It will increase                our understanding of Africa's past. It will provide data of                     interest to a large number of paleoanthropologists and shed new                 light on the emergence of modern humans.",
