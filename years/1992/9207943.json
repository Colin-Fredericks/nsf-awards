In particular the goal                                             is to characterize flow-prediction                                              errors when using satellite                                                     rainfall estimates in the real-time                                             prediction of streamflows from                                                  large catchments.  Uncertainty due                                              to rainfall estimation errors is                                                explicitly taken into account and                                               is propagated through the                                                       meteorological and hydrological                                                 models and procedures to become                                                 uncertainty in the real-time flow                                               predictions.                                                                                                                                                    This is a joint project in which                                                the satellite data analysis will be                                             performed at the University of                                                  Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the                                                     hydrological part will be performed                                             at the University of Iowa.                                                                                                                                      The results of this research will                                               benefit experts, administrators and                                             other users because the developed                                               methods for integrating rainfall                                                satellite data and hydrologic data                                              will be used in predicting flows in                                             real-time and thus, the quality of                                              real-time flood prediction will be                                              enhanced.",
