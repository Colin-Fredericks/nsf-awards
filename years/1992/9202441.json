 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)                  which will be dedicated to support fundamental research of                      materials.  Examples of research studies include the investigations             of quasicrystals and complex intermetallic crystals, polymer                    processing for optical waveguides, composite materials, nanophase               materials, and studies of magnetic recording media.  The SEM would              have a resolution of 3.5 nm at 30 Kv, an accelerating voltage range             of 0.2kV to 40 Kv, and a magnification range from 10x to 300,000x.              These specifications offer a large degree of flexibility for                    electron microscopy studies and will significantly help current                 research efforts as well as future projects.  An integral part of               the SEM would be a Wavelength Dispersive Spectrometer (WDS) and an              Energy Dispersive X-ray Spoectrometer (EDS).  These two subsystems              give elemental analysis with submicron resolution in the lateral                direction.  This capability is important when studying multi-                   elemental systems such as intermetallics and composite materials.               The high lateral resolution allows studies of composition variation             within individual grains and at the grain boundaries.                           %%%                                                                             The Materials Science and Engineering Program at Washington                     University in materials science and applied physics spans several               departments over two schools.  These inlcude the departments of                 mechanical, electrical, chemical and civil engineering in the                   School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and physics and                     chemistry in the School of Arts and Sciences.  Graduate research in             the Materials Research Laboratory is active in the structure and                properties of metals, polymers, ceramics, composites, advanced                  metal and polymer processing methods, polymer processing rheology,              fracture mechanics of solids, and the fabrication, chemistry,                   physics, and mechanical behavior of composite materials.",
