 "awd_abstract_narration": "The c-type cytochromes possess heme that is covalenty ligated to                the apocytochrome and these cytochromes are present in distinct                 compartments within eucaryotes (i.e., mitochondrial intermembrane               space) and procaryotes (i.e., periplasmic space).  Major questions              that remain concern what factors are needed for their assembly and              how these individual factors are themselves transported to the                  proper compartments.                                                            The long-term objective of this work is to understand at a detailed             molecular level the specific proteins and events that are required              for the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes.  Moreover, the mechanism              by which heme is transported across bilayer membranes from its site             of biosynthesis, the mitochondrial matrix or the bacterial                      cytoplasm, is a fundamental question in biology.                                Specifically, using the Gram negative photosynthetic bacterium,                 Rhodobacter capsulatus, we will develop biochemical assays for                  processes required in cytochrome c biogenesis.  Previous molecular              analysis of R.capsulatus mutants that are defective in cytochrome               c biogenesis have indicated that hel genes may encode the first-                reported specific heme transporter; ccl gene products may be                    involved in the ligation of heme to apocytochrome c in the                      periplasmic space.  Thus, we will develop (1) in vitro heme                     transport assays and (2) in vitro heme lyase assays and apply these             to R. capsulatus mutants that are predicted to be defective in                  these processes.                                                                %%%                                                                             Both eucaryotes and procaryotes possess heme proteins called c-type             cytochromes that are present in distinct compartments within their              cells.  These cytochromes are vital for mitochondrial and bacterial             electron transport processes and consequently ATP production.  The              c-type cytochromes have been the subject of thousands of studies                concerning their function and structure (e.g., X-ray                            crystallography). Nevertheless, little is known about how a native              c-type cytochrome is assembled in a particular compartment.  For                example, it is unknown how (and in what form) heme is transported               from its site of biosynthesis, the mitochondrial matrix or the                  bacterial cytoplasm, to the assembly site of the cytochrome (i.e.,              the mitochondrial intermembrane space or the bacterial periplasm).              Thus, the mechanism of heme transport across bilayer membranes is               a fundamental question in biology.                                              Our previous molecular genetic analysis of mutants in the                       bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus that are specially defective in                cytochromes c biogenesis, have implicated specific gene products                (called hel) as the best candidate (and first ever reported) for a              specific heme transporter.  This proposal includes the development              of in vitro heme transport assays to further investigate these                  defects.  Additionally, the mechanism by which heme is covalently               ligated to the apocytochromes will be studied by the development of             in vitro assays for this process.  The long-term objective of this              work is to understand at a detailed molecular level the specific                proteins and events that are required for the biogenesis of c-type              cytochromes in bacteria.",
