 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to 1) allow the principal                    investigator to learn and become proficient in avian endocrine                  research techniques, and 2) apply these techniques to address new               questions about the hormonal basis of sexually-selected behaviors               in dabbling ducks.  The study  will include four experiments with               captive  northern pintails (Anas acuta) and white-cheeked                       pintails (A. bahamensis) that are designed to 1) test the                       hypothesis that the stimuli associated with pair formation induce               hormonal changes that alter male behavior and dominance                         relationships, 2) test the effect of experimental manipulations of              sexually-selected morphological traits on male behavior, hormonal               dynamics and pairing success, 3) examine the hormonal correlates                and energetic costs of aggressiveness in polygynous, monogamous,                and unpaired males, and 4) compare hormonal responses to a social               challenge in northern pintails, a monogamous and non-territorial                species , and white-cheeked pintails, which are occasionally                    polygynous and highly territorial.  Blood samples taken during                  these experiments will be analyzed for 5 hormones using celite                  chromatography and radioimmunoassay.  This cross-disciplinary                   project will address not only the effect of hormones on behavior                but also the feedback of behavior and social interactions on                    hormones.  Few studies of mate choice have considered the                       implications of endocrine mechanisms in the evolution of                        sexually-selected behavior.",
