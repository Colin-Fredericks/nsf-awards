This award enables              approximately six to eight undergraduate students to perform                    astronomical research with professional scientists at Penn State                during the summer months.  Under the direction of Drs. Lawrence W.              Ramsey and Margaret M. Chester, students will do research on a                  variety of topics in astronomy, and will have access to telescope               facilities, image processing laboratories, and optical and space                instrument laboratories.  Supplementing their research, students                will attend a weekly seminar series in which faculty will discuss               introductory astronomy material and students will be able to                    present the results of their own work later in the summer.                                                                                                      REU sites such as the one planned at Pennsylvania State University              are important in increasing the technical and scientific skills of              the Nation's most talented and motivated undergraduates, and in                 enabling those students to experience state-of-the-art scientific               research before they make their final career decisions.",
