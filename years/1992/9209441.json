 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the development and application of                       laboratory experimental methods in the broad field of political                 economy and on the principles that govern the behavior of                       interdependent and changing systems begun under earlier NSF                     grants.  There will be an intensified focus on the                              interdependence and dynamic behavior of complicated systems, and                on new institutional arrangements that facilitate the efficient                 use of information and the reduction of uncertainty.  This                      project will play a leadership role in using experimental methods               as testbeds for the types of institutional changes currently                    under consideration as a response to the challenges posed by                    global environmental change.  This project will also contribute                 to our understanding of the way decisions are made under                        uncertainty with irreversibilities and potentially catastrophic                 consequences for future generations.                                                                                                                            Research projects can be grouped into five categories: 1) those                 that focus primarily on the interdependence of activities of                    economic processes; 2) those in which information plays a central               role; 3) those that focus more narrowly on the properties of                    equilibria that occur in markets; 4) those that involve the                     \"testbedding\" of new institutions; and 5) experimental technology               development.  The research on experimental technology development               is especially exciting because it will make a sophisticated                     experimental system capable of supporting a very wide range of                  experiments freely available for a broad audience of researchers.               Under the previous grant a manual and diskette were produced and                disseminated for a computerized laboratory market system.  The                  package included programs for creating and executing experiments,               programs for viewing and processing data, and programs for                      training subjects.  The technology development effort will now                  turn to processes with political elements.  Since politics is                   frequently about the choices of institutions and processes, any                 new software should be capable of facilitating experiments in                   which institutional evolution can take place.",
