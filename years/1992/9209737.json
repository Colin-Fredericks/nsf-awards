 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators study the spatial and temporal dynamics of               territory formation for wolves (Canis lupus) and the resulting                  impact on the distribution of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus                     virginianus).  Their model is based on field studies from                       northeastern Minnesota that indicate that adjacent wolf packs                   form distinct territories that are separated by \"buffer zones\"                  where packs rarely trespass.  These buffer zones can provide a                  spatial refuge for the primary prey species: white-tailed deer.                 The field studies show that deer density is higher in the                       inter-territorial areas (refuges) and is lower near the center of               established territories (where deer populations may be subject to               intense predation).  The buffer zones may also stabilize                        wolf-deer interactions by providing a reservoir of deer that can                recolonize areas of wolf territory that have suffered heavy                     predation losses.                                                                    The mathematical model the investigators develop describes                 the behavioral wolf-wolf and wolf-deer interactions using a                     system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, and                 describes the long-term ecological wolf-deer interactions using a               system of coupled nonlinear difference equations.  The analysis                 of the model equations will employ mathematical and numerical                   techniques from areas such as perturbation theory and finite                    difference numerical methods.  This should lead to a detailed                   quantitative understanding of wolf territorial pattern formation,               and an illustration of how territoriality influences the                        distribution and abundance of deer.  The research will have a                   wider application to the general area of territorial pattern                    formation; such patterns provide the basis for social                           organization in many mammals and birds.",
