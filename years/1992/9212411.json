 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses a series of problems arising in                    industry, in geophysics  and in statistics; all require intensive               computational efforts and most have a strong geometric aspect.                  Whether the topic is geometric work associated with the design of               molecules, the timing of folding and magnetization of the earth                 or dynamical systems of fractals, the emphasis and the novelty                  will be found in the formulation of the problems.  The methods of               attack will draw on computational mathematics, as in the                        computation of fractal dimensions and the fractal pursuit index.                     Access to affordable computing means that \"solutions\" for                  practical problems can be found.  More than ever before, the                    important step is that of expressing the problem precisely and                  correctly in mathematical terms in order to execute correct                     computations.  This means capturing the scientific essence of the               problem, which is not always what it at first appears to be.                    Then, with careful selection of mathematical and computational                  methods, simulation and other procedures can yield good working                 solutions or even exact ones.",
