 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social measurements derived from informant judgements                      are widespread and improvements in their quality are critical                   to advancing social science research.  Examples of these                        measurements,  drawn from various areas of social science,                      include:  ratings of occupational prestige in sociology,                        rankings of friendship in social networks and social                            psychology,  determinants of group preferences in social                        choice,  judgments of the similarity among kinship terms in                     anthropology,  and judgments of the seriousness of crimes in                    political science, etc.                                                              The long range goal the this research is to contribute                     scientific methods to improve the quality of social                             measurements that depend upon aggregating the judgments of                      informants.  Social concepts such as cultural beliefs and                       social norms are defined by social conventions,   with no                       outside criteria for comparison.  Measurements must be                          inferred from the pattern of responses among informants,                        obtained in field settings with limitations on time,                            facilities,  and number of informants.                                               Combining methods from foundations of measurement and                      statistical modelling,  this research probes the fundamental                    logic underlying two problems basic to social measurement:                      (1) How can one meaningfully infer item attributes from                         responses of informants,  each of whom may be calibrated on a                   different scale ?  Meaningful social attributes should                          satisfy some sort of invariance under permissible                               transformations in the response scales of each informant.                       Improved measures of interitem similarity and social network                    concepts will result from such investigation.  (2)  How can                     one assess the quality of the information provided by each                      informant in order to arrive an an optimal weighting scheme                     for aggregating responses ?  The research develops new                          statistical models for different scaling techniques such as                     magnitude estimation,  paired comparisons,  and the constant                    sum method.  The models will allow researchers to optimize                      the reliability of aggregated data.                                                  The significance of the research is that it will provide                   new methods of social measurement comparable in quality to                      those used in such areas as psychophysics, where comparisons                    with objective physical stimuli are utilized.  The                              interdisciplinary collaboration of the two investigators has                    been extremely successful in the past.  The promise of their                    ambitious research agenda,  both in its conceptual                              significance and practical import,  is equally great.",
