 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies iterative methods to solve linear                 algebraic systems of equations efficiently on both sequential and               parallel computers.  In a large class of iterative methods, each                iteration consists of a solution of another system of equations.                If that system is in turn solved by an iterative method, it is                  called a two-stage iterative method.  Among the questions to be                 investigated are criteria to determine the optimal or                           near-optimal number of inner iterations to guarantee overall                    convergence of the two-stage method.  When a matrix is                          appropriately partitioned by blocks, and its diagonal blocks are                nonsingular, many of the classical iterative methods can be                     generalized to treat each submatrix as a component.  On a MIMD                  parallel computer (a computer that executes multiple streams of                 instructions on multiple streams of data), each diagonal block                  can be solved by a different processor, using components of                     previous iterations as soon as they are available.  These are                   chaotic or asynchronous parallel block iterative methods.  Their                convergence properties as well as implementation details will be                studied.  Iterative methods for the solution of the general                     eigenvalue problem will also be studied.  Experiments with these                methods will be performed on different parallel architectures.                       A large class of problems in science and enginering is                     described by linear systems of equations.  These are equations in               which the unknown quantities appear in a simple way.  An example                of a linear system is the description of the forces on a building               structure.  These forces need to be calculated to design the                    building materials.  The quantities to be calculated, called the                variables or unknowns, are the forces on particular points of the               structure.  To describe a big structure, such as a high-rise                    building or a bridge, many hundreds or thousands of equations are               needed, but because the forces on each point come only from a few               neighboring points, the equations are relatively simple.  A                     simple iterative method to solve such equations, that is, to find               the values of the unknowns, consists in giving an initial                       approximation for the values of some unknowns, and then computing               the values of the resulting forces on the other points of the                   structure.  Parallel computers are simply a collection of                       computers or processors that communicate with each other.  In the               method just described, different processors can compute the value               of the forces on different points simultaneously, using the                     information already computed by the other processors.  This is                  repeated until all values satisfy all equations.  This situation,               if attained, is called convergence. Not all iterative methods                   attain convergence.  In this project, the iterative methods for                 which convergence can be guaranteed will be studied.  Experiments               will be carried out to test them.",
