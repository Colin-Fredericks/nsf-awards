 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Lynch, working with Ms. Kathleen Jordan, is tracing the                     construction and implementation of a new molecular biology                      technique as it changes from a highly specialized experimental tool             to a commercial product.  The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a              technique developed within the past few years for quickly                       replicating specific target sequences of DNA.  It is said to be                 much simpler and less time-consuming than alternative techniques in             molecular biology, and it is currently being packaged as an easy-               to-use \"black box\" for sale to medical facilities, forensic labs,               and research labs in numerous basic and applied scientific fields.              PCR's development has been so rapid that it enables ethnographic                methods of study to be used to examine the historical                           transformation of an esoteric technique into a standardized and                 commercialized product.  While sustaining an intensive and present-             centered ethnography of a coherent technique, the study aims to                 attain the kind of broader insight that historical and cross-                   institutional comparison can yield.  It thus aims to contribute                 methodological innovation as well as substantive information to the             field of science studies.",
