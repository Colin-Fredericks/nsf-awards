 "awd_abstract_narration": "New directions in geometric group theory have emerged in the               past few years in the areas of word hyperbolic groups, automatic                groups, and spaces of nonpositive curvature.  Professors Charney                and Davis will continue research on a number of problems in these               areas.  Charney (together with M. Shapiro) plans research on                    several questions related to the automaticity of Artin groups.  She             also plans to study the problem of putting a metric of nonpositive              curvature on several building-like complexes.  Davis (also with M.              Shapiro) plans to work on the conjecture that all Coxeter groups                are automatic.  Related to this is his project to study properties              of the boundary of a Coxeter group.  This might also be useful in               finding a group of cohomological dimension two but geometric                    dimension three (the Eilenberg-Ganea Question).  Finally, jointly,              Charney and Davis intend to work on strict hyperbolization                      procedures and relative hyperbolization procedures.  \"Strict\"                   refers to the possibility of converting a complex into a space of               strictly negative curvature (rather than just nonpositive                       curvature).  \"Relative\" refers to the problem of keeping the metric             on a subcomplex fixed.  Charney and Davis also plan to continue                 their research on nonpositively curved orbifolds.  The issue here               is to decide when certain piecewise spherical metrics on spheres                are \"large.\"                                                                         Groups are the appropriate algebraic structures for describing             the notion of symmetry with precision.  For this reason they play               an extensive role in geometry (and topology).  While the more usual             interaction between group theory and geometry is the use of                     algebraic computations involving groups to prove theorems about                 geometric objects possessing symmetry, there is a very significant              mathematical subdiscipline in which the roles are reversed and our              intuition about geometric objects assists us in conjecturing and                proving theorems about associated groups.  A fascinating recent                 development is the influence of the computer in all this.  Not only             is it the ubiquitous timesaver that everyone knows, enabling one to             undertake computations that would otherwise be too formidable, but              it has actually influenced the questions in geometric group theory              in a more fundamental way.  Certain classes of groups have been                 defined in terms of the types of hypothetical machines that would               be able to perform certain computations about them.  Real hardware              is not involved in this, and the same definitions could have been               conceived long ago, but they were not, for the existence of                     computing machines has influenced the way we look at the world, the             types of questions we ask about it, the kinds of properties that we             find interesting.",
