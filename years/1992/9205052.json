 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vacuolar function is essential to the regulation of cytosolic                calcium levels.  Calcium-binding proteins unique to the vacuolar                membrane have been identified.  The immediate goal of this project              is to purify and characterize these proteins in terms of affinity,              capacity, and cation selectivity.  Polyclonal antibodies will be                used to study the tissue-specific expression patterns of these                  proteins, particularly with regard to the process of vacuolation                and biogenesis of the vacuole membrane system.  Antibody will                   further serve to identify cDNA clones in expression libraries                   encoding these proteins.                                                        %%%                                                                             Plant cells contain large membrane-enclosed compartments, which                 serve a number of biochemical and structural functions for the                  plant cell.  Some of these are relatively \"universal\" functions                 associated generally with lysosome-type compartments; others are                unique for plants.   Accordingly, the vacuole has an essential role             in growth and development.  It is remarkable that few vacuolar                  membrane activities have been examined and fewer still have been                identified and examined at the molecular level.  There is not yet               a clear understanding of either the origins of this organelle or                the means by which vacuolar membrane proteins are continuously                  replenished.    This study will contribute to an understanding of               the molecular basis for the role of the vacuole in conferring to                higher plants the ability to respond to its environment and carry               out the normal processes of growth and development.",
