 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Richard Burger Mr. Warren Church will                collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze                     archaeological materials excavated at the site of Cueva Manachaki               which is located in the \"cloud forest\" region of Eastern Peru.                  This area lies at a middle altitude and separates the high open                 Andean grasslands from the low lying tropical Amazon rainforest.                The site itself is a small rock shelter which contains finely                   stratified deposits which span the per-ceramic through ceramic                  periods. Excavation has yielded not only large quantities of                    ceramic and lithic materials but also well preserved organic                    remains. Mr Church and his colleagues will analyze these                        materials to accomplish three goals: 1. to determine the cultural               sequence for this little known region; 2. to test the hypothesis                of long-term cultural development and subsequent evaluation of                  the alternative migration hypotheses through analysis of                        continuity and change in the cultural sequence; and 3. to                       identify and interpret evidence for highland-lowland rainforest                 interaction.                                                                                                                                                    Peru is of great archaeological interest for several reasons. It                saw the rise of a series of complex state level societies before                arrival of the Spanish. The region is also characterized by                     strong vertical zonation where the steep rise of the Andes                      creates a number of distinct ecological zones in close proximity.               Many models have been developed which link the development of                   complex societies to the need to coordinate the movement of                     subsistence goods across zones. While extensive excavations have                provided excellent data bases for some regions, others including                the cloud forest are little understood. Mr. Church hypothesizes                 that local adaption took place within this zone and that it                     served as more than a way station between highlands and lowlands.               Analysis of materials from the unique site of Cueva Manachaki                   will allow him to evaluate this idea.                                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our                   understanding of the processes which lead to the development of                 complex societies and will assist in the training of a promising                young scientist.",
