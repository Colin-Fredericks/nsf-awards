 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymer surface coatings strongly affect colloid stability in                   a broad spectrum of important engineering processes.  Polymers                  are used as flocculants or stabilizers in water and waste                       treatment, mineral processing, coal-water slurry                                stabilization, paint production, food colloid stabilization,                    separation of bacterial suspensions, paper making, brewing,                     ceramics fabrication, pharmaceutical preparation, and                           agrochemical formulation.  The stability, mobility, and                         chemical reactively of colloidal particles naturally present                    in groundwater and other aquatic systems are strongly                           controlled by surface coatings of organic molecules.  Since                     these particles influence the transport of chemical or                          radioactive contaminants and the survival of pathogenic                         microorganisms, the presence of organic-coated colloids must                    be accounted for in models that predict the fate of hazardous                   wastes in the environment.                                                                                                                                      This research seeks to clarify the mechanisms by which                          surface-adsorbed polymers influences colloid stability in                       aqueous systems.  Theoretical and experimental studies                          indicates that the stability of coated colloidal particles                      depends critically on the conformation of the adsorbing                         molecule.  Despite the implied importance of polymer                            conformation on colloid stability, there are no experimental                    techniques which directly measure the conformation of adsorbed                  polymers.  A major goal of this research is to develop a                        method for examining the conformation of single-stranded DNA                    molecules adsorbed to colloidal latex particles using a                         technology called \"DNA footprinting\".  This technology,                         originally developed by biochemists to investigate protein/DNA                  interactions, will be used to ascertain the fraction of                         adsorbed DNA that is distributed between trains, loops and                      tails.  The response of this distribution to changes in                         surface and solution chemistry will be investigated and                         related to concomitant changes in colloid stability.",
