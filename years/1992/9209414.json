 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a U.S.-U.K. project development workshop in                 biological oceanography.  The organizers are Gary Kleppel of the                Nova University Oceanographic Center, Dania, Florida and Keith                  Brander of the Fisheries Laboratory, Ministry of Agriculture,                   Fisheries and Food of the United Kingdom. Scientists from other                 parts of the United Kingdom (Wales and Scotland) and Ireland will               also participate. The purpose of the workshop is to synthesize                  the current state of knowledge on environmental regulation of                   productivity in the Irish Sea, and to identify data gaps and                    research objectives for a future regional cooperative research                  effort.                                                                                                                                                         The Irish Sea is a shallow body of water bordered by Scotland,                  England, Wales, the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, and                  the Island of Man.  Although it has been the site of many                       traditional biological investigations, questions involving the                  links between natural environmental variability and productivity                (including fish production) in the Irish Sea remain unanswered.                 The workshop will focus on problems concerning the relationships                between organisms and their physical environments, pelagic food                 webs, and the factors limiting larval fish survival.  While work                on the Irish Sea benefits local regional and scientific interests               in the British Isles, it also augments current research on these                same questions in the U.S. and in other countries.  The workshop                provides an opportunity for participants to plan a regional study               on the issues of immediate interest to the region and on the                    broader issue of global climate change and its impact on marine                 food webs and production.",
