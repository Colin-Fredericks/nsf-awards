 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unlike other tissues, the small intestine abundantly expresses more             than one (actually four) homologous lipid binding protein (LBP) in              the same cell type.  These proteins exhibit differences in lipid-               binding specificities and stoichiometries, regional expression, and             developmental regulation.  Because of these differences, the LBP                homologues represent excellent model systems for investigating                  structural differentiation within a gene family of lipid-transport              proteins.  The overall objective of the proposed research is to                 determine and compare the structural and dynamic properties of                  three LBPs in solution using NMR and recombinant DNA techniques.                The specific aims are: (i) to purify large quantities of native and             isotope-enriched proteins from bacteria using suitably constructed              prokaryotic expression vectors, (ii) to establish sequence-specific             proton, carbon-13, and nitrogen-15 resonance assignments for each               protein using isotope-directed multidimensional NMR methods, and                (iii) to use the resulting assignments. for each protein to define              and compare their structures, dynamics and detailed interactions                with bound lipids.  A detailed comparison of the solution                       structures and lipid interactions with these transport proteins                 will yield fundamental information regarding the molecular                      determinants of ligand specificity, stoichiometry, and affinity and             provide insights into their individual functions.                               %%%                                                                             This research involves the study and comparison of three similar                but distinct proteins found in the lining of the small intestine.               These three proteins are thought to play a role the absorption and              processing of fatty substances absorbed from the diet.  They are                not presently known to be linked to any disease state involving                 cholesterol or fats.  However, the individual functions of these                proteins are not well understood.  The goal of this research is to              develop a complete picture of the molecular architecture of these               three proteins so that their individual molecular properties and                roles in fat metabolism and transport can be understood.  To do                 this, we are taking advantage of state-of-the art magnetic                      resonance methods (NMR), combined with recombinant DNA procedures.              It is likely that the information obtained will provide insights                into how these and other similar proteins achieve specificity as                carriers of fatty substances.",
