 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is founded upon the Phase I work which proved                     that small quantities of low cost proprietary catalysts were                    effective in achieving large NOx reduction.  The major                          objectives of the Phase I research plan were met or exceeded,                   including proof of the catalytic activity of the materials to                   achieve 40% reductions of NOx in a laboratory reactor.  A                       statistical experimental design was used to develop empirical                   rate coefficients.  This proposal extends the Phase I work,                     proposing larger scale testing under commercially relevant                      catalyst loadings and operating conditions.  Particle size,                     catalyst aging, and the effects of H2O, hydrocarbons, SOx, and                  other potential poisons will be investigated.  Phase II                         extends the operating scope to low temperatures (320 F to 550                   F), as the Phase I work implied that the catalysts are active                   at temperatures below 550 F (560 K).                                                                                                                            The catalysts are low cost, using materials endemic to the                      U.S., and represent U.S. technology.  The successful concept                    has the potential to reduce NOx compliance and energy costs,                    resulting in economic benefits to the U.S. power industry.",
