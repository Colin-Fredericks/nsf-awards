 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significant global scale decreases in total ozone, an atmospheric               gas surrounding the earth, have occurred during the past decades.               With the depletion of the ozone layer, the atmosphere becomes                   more transparent to solar ultraviolet radiation. It is well                     established from laboratory experiments that ultraviolet                        radiation can have a deleterious effect on living organisms.                    Ultraviolet radiation can affect the genetic material of cells                  and can affect various cellular components which regulate                       biological reactions controlling cell growth and reproduction.                  What is less known is the impact of increased ultraviolet                       radiation on whole organisms and on organisms in the natural                    environment. The focus of this workshop is to bring together                    scientific experts to assess the effects of ultraviolet radiation               on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. A workshop report will                   summarize the current status of knowledge and will develop a                    prioritized research plan of objectives and scientific tasks.                   This will provide the international scientific community with a                 focus to address the issue of ozone depletion effects on the                    global system.",
