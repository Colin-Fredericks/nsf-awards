 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the mechanisms by which a group of                   fungal plant pathogens from the genus Cercospora, exhibit                       resistance to the photosensitizing toxin cercosporin that they                  produce. Cercosporin produces singlet oxygen when activated by                  light and is toxic to a wide variety of organisms, including mice,              plants, bacteria and many fungi. However, Cercospora species                    produce high concentrations of this compound in the light and are               unaffected by its presence. Published evidence suggests that the                production of carotenoids and the ability of Cercospora fungi to                reduce and detoxify the cercosporin molecule are the primary                    mechanisms of resistance to the toxin. This project tests the                   hypothesis for the involvement of carotenoids in cercosporin                    detoxification through the generation of a series of carotenoid-                deficient mutants produced by gene disruption experiments. Mutants              that are either sensitive to cercosporin or deficient in                        cercosporin-reducing ability will provide alternative means to test             for possible mechanisms of detoxification.                                      %%%                                                                                Naturally-occurring toxins are usually without effect in the                 cells in which they are produced, yet they can be potent poisons in             the cells of closely-related organisms. The cellular mechanisms of              detoxification in toxin-producing organisms are thought to involve              either the chemical modification that results in the inactivation               of the toxin or the compartmentalization of the active toxin                    molecules away from targets elsewhere in the cell. The chemical                 basis for cercosporin toxicity is understood and the inactivation               of cercosporin through its chemical reduction is thoroughly                     reasonable. This project provides a straightforward test of the                 involvement of carotenoids in the reduction of this toxin and will              contribute to our understanding of detoxification in a variety of               other organisms.",
