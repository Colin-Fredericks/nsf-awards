 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flight in insects is a sophisticated behavior which requires an                 array of physiological and morphological specializations. Flight                behavior provides a convenient system for investigating temporally              precise neural processes, as well as novel aerodynamic mechanisms.              The research to be done under this award to Dr. Michael Dickinson               focuses on the flight control of insects at several levels of                   analysis: from the physiological properties of identified neurons               and muscles to the mechanics of wings and resultant production of               aerodynamic forces. The work will characterize the neural circuitry             and flight forces underlying a specific steroetyped component of                flight control behavior which involves the rapid rotation of the                wings during the transition from downstroke to upstroke which is                modulated during turning manuevers. The timing may be controlled                by a specific steering muscle whose output is modified by both                  rapid sensory feedback from receptors on the wings as well as                   visual input descending from the head. The circuitry will be                    studied by intracellular recording from motor neurons during                    controlled stimulation of sensory pathways. The effects of muscle               stimulation on wing rotation will also be tested. The flight                    apparatus will be equipped with a torque balance, so that the                   aerodynamic forces can be directly correlated with changes in the               timing of the flight locomotion. This research will contribute to               the understanding of rapid sensory-motor processing and aerodynamic             mechanisms of flight.",
