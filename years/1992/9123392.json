Such studies                  repeatedly refer to women who talk tough, talk rough, women, in                 short, who talk like men.  This study examines the speech of                    policewomen and policemen in Pittsburgh, examining their                        management of verbal conflict, lexical encoding of affect, pitch                range and pitch dynamicity, and use of vernacular phonlogical                   variables to determine when and how women choose to talk in                     masculine ways.  Questions considered include:  Do policewomen                  employ the same verbal strategies for resolution of conflict as                 do policemen?  When do policewomen and policemen manipulate                     inexpressiveness to legitimate their authority in the community,                and what are the linguistic markers of inexpressiveness?  Have                  women whose speech is perceived as masculine adopted more                       monotonic, less dynamic intonational contours?  The study also                  considers the widespread finding that men are more likely to use                vernacular phonological forms to project themselves as tough than               are women of the same class, by investigating the following                     Pittsburgh vernacular variables:  vocalization of /\\/,                          neutralization of tense-lax vocalic contrasts before/\\/,                        monophthongization of (al) and (aw), use of apical nasals for                   velar nasals in the morpheme -ing, and realization of voiceless                 and voiced interdental fricatives as stops.  This study                         critically examines the common sociolinguistic assumption that                  although language varies across social contexts, social                         attributes like gender do not.  In particular it focusses on the                ways that linguistic projections of gender-typed characteristics                vary according to speaker's occupation.  Finally, the study                     suggests that rather than understanding the use of certain                      linguistic features as marking a social roles (e.g. understanding               vocalization of /\\/ as a male marker), sociolinguistics should                  explore how linguistic features are associated with certain                     linguistic styles (e.g. tough, masculine) that that are                         normatively associated with certain social groups, situations and               occupations.  The project then becomes to understand how                        individual speakers manipulate the available speech styles to                   project the social identities they wish to create for themselves.",
