 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thrust of this mathematical research revolves around                   applications of recent developments in wavelet theory.  The first               application will focus on algebras of linear operators generated                by those of Calderon-Zygmund type.  These operators arise in the                analysis of partial differential equations.  The operators are                  too complex to study individually; the goal of current research                 is to choose wavelet bases in which the operators may be                        represented as almost-diagonal matrices.  From this                             representation, one can read off many hidden properties of the                  operators.  A second line of investigation concerns wavelet                     decompositions in higher dimensional space.  This work will begin               with the representation of radial functions in term of wavelets                 which somehow respect the symmetry.  The fundamental difficulty                 is that one cannot symmetrize one-dimensional wavelets and                      maintain the desired translation properties.  Some progress has                 been made in developing a new wavelet-type function with many                   desirable properties preserved.  A third direction of this                      research is that of distinguishing the behavior of the different                Riesz transforms on functions spaces using wavelet-type                         representations.                                                                     Wavelet theory has introduced an extraordinary new tool into               the field of harmonic analysis.  It contains the elements of a                  highly effective theoretical method for the representation of                   functions along with natural algorithms for the computation of                  various expansions of functions which are simultaneously local in               time and frequency.  There applications are only beginning to be                felt in the scientific and engineering community.",
