 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project with the General Motors Research                     Laboratory at Warren Michigan focuses on controller synthesis                   and development of analytical and numerical tools suitable for                  performance evaluation of semi-active vehicle suspensions under                 a variety of road conditions. Particular emphasis in on the                     dynamic interaction between the suspension and the body structure               whose compliance is included in the model. Inclusion of body                    compliance is considered necessary in view of the high frequency                harshness observed in recent studies of suspension systems with                 on-off dampers, which has potential for exciting body structural                resonances and may lead to deterioration in ride comfort. Control               laws governing the variation of damping coefficients in semi-active             dampers will be obtained using calculus of variations. In this                  approach the suspension system can be optimized with respect to a               suitable performance index under specified constraints. Simplified              control laws  that may still yield acceptable performance but are               easier to implement will also be considered. Evaluation of system               performance in time and frequency domains will allow prediction of              the degree of improvements resulting from application of more                   sophisticated control laws and continuously variable dampers prior to           building and testing prototypes***//",
