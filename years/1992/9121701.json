 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the inhospitable lowland regions of Middle America,                          prehistoric Mayan peoples evolved a civilization which produced                 dramatic large scale architecture, a highly centralized class                   stratified society and which integrated large areas through well                developed trade mechanisms.  Although this phenomenon has                       intrigued archaeologists for almost a century, they still do not                understand the processes which led to the emergence and                         maintenance of this society.  Dr. Anabel Ford has worked for many               years in the Belize River area of Belize.  Based on extensive                   survey and the analysis of recovered materials, she has                         postulated a model of economic specialization in which household                units living in slightly different environmental zones focussed                 on slightly different activities and then traded across these                   zones.  This, she believes, provides the underlying basis for                   Mayan development in this area.                                                                                                                                 With NSF support, Dr. Ford will excavate a series of small                      household sites located in one remaining zone which she has not                 studied in detail.  This will set her survey data into a broader                and more meaningful context and will provide a basis for cross                  zone comparison.  She will conduct large scale horizontal                       exposures to uncover entire household units.  The ceramics, chert               and obsidian remains will be collected and analyzed to address                  three major questions: the character of the domestic economy; the               kinds and degree of craft production and distribution; and the                  influence of local, regional and inter-regional exchange.  Since                both \"elite\" and peasant\" households will be included in the                    sample, it should be possible to determine how such strategies                  are related to class.                                                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons.  Although                       archaeologists have excavated many Mayan sites, the primary focus               has been on large ceremonial centers.  Dr. Ford's project, which                concentrates on household structures will help to remedy this                   situation.  The project includes an undergraduate student and                   will contribute to the development of a promising young                         scientist.",
