 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each year, American industry spray applies more than 500                        million gallons of paints and other coatings.  For every                        gallon of paint sprayed, an average of four and one half                        pounds of solvents are released into the atmosphere.  These                     solvents are mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)                      that are chosen for their ability to dissolve the coating's                     materials and to reduce their viscosity.                                                                                                                        A new process has been developed for the spray application of                   paints and other coatings.  It was conceived by the PI and is                   being commercialized by the Union Carbide Corporation and                       other companies.  The process, which improves the quality of                    sprayed coatings for automobiles, furniture, and other                          commercial products and reduces pollution, is based on the use                  of supercritical carbon dioxide as a replacement for organic                    solvents in spray-coatings' formulations.  The result is a                      more uniform and improved coating and a reduction of the                        emissions of VOCs by up to 80%.                                                                                                                                 Though the process is in commercial use, there are problems                     that must be overcome before there will be widespread adoption                  of this technology, and hence large reductions in VOC                           emissions from spray-coating operations in the U.S.  The major                  impediment is that each paint must be reformulated before it                    can be used in this process.  Since there are hundreds of                       different paint formulations, each with dozens of different                     components, this will be a major undertaking because                            relatively little is known about the phase behavior of                          polymer-solvent-supercritical fluid mixtures, particularly                      when solid phases can form.  Hence, the reformulation must be                   done by trial and error changing many different variables.                      Also, the reformulation process will be done separately, and                    secretly, by every paint manufacturer.                                                                                                                          The PI plans to study the thermodynamic and rheological                         properties of polymer-solvent-carbon dioxide mixtures.  The                     experimental part of the project will involve measurements to                   determine phase diagrams and solution viscosities for these                     mixtures.  The theoretical portion will involve the                             development of models for the effects of hydrogen bonding on                    the liquid-liquid phase behavior and on modelling the effects                   of solids precipitation on the overall phase diagram.  This                     should facilitate the implementation of this technology for a                   wider variety of paint formulations and should help eliminate                   process shut-downs that result when solids form in these                        systems.",
