The program is directed at qualified undergraduate students                     enrolled at IIT  as well as at other universities and colleges in               the State of Illinois.  It is designed to provide the students with             hands-on experience in fluid mechanics research in an environment               where they will be exposed to new and exciting research problems.               A REU participant is a member of a research team, interacting with              the faculty as well as with other students.  He/she will be given               specific assignments tailored to obtain the right mix of knowledge,             the acquisition of new skills, and a sense of accomplishment and                belonging.",
