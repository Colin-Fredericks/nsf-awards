 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Weller and Hosom request funding for initial development of                documentation for Improved Meteorological (IMET) sensors.  More                 accurate meteorological data is required for many of the research               efforts planned as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment               (WOCE), which will begin field experiments in 1992.  Although                   many sensors are available commercially, their accuracy and                     calibration for ships and buoys had not been tested until                       recently.  Work completed in an initial grant to the PI's (OCE-                 87-09614) quantified the performance characteristics of some of                 the buoy and ship sensors, and cooperation between the PI's and                 manufacturers resulted in improvements to the sensors.                          Development of a data logging system that is applicable to any                  sensor was also completed and licensed to a commercial                          manufacturer.                                                                                                                                                   Although the IMET sensors are now available commercially, they                  will not function at specified WOCE standards without proper                    calibration and installation, which will be unique for each UNOLS               vessel.  As stated in the proposal, \"Since the development of                   IMET was carried out at WHOI, the expertise to document the                     system and carry out initial system installation on several ships               currently resides only at WHOI.\"  This proposal requests funds to               begin the documentation of the expertise that has been developed                at WHOI so that the information will be available for all UNOLS                 operators.  This information in needed to provide accurate                      meteorological data to researchers as soon as possible.",
