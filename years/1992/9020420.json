The primary objective of                              this work is to obtain a comprehensive                                          understanding of the major contributions to the                                 switching mechanisms in these materials.  This will                             enable systematic modification and control of the                               film characteristics to achieve optimum film                                    performance for specific device applications.                                   Experimental studies will include dielectric and                                transmission measurements of PDLC films in                                      response to fields of sufficient strength to reorient                           the liquid crystal director.  Electron microscopy will                          provide information on droplet geometry.  These                                 measurements will be used to correlate the                                      response with important film properties:  the                                   electrical characteristics, liquid crystal elastic                              constants, droplet size and droplet shape.  To                                  achieve a comprehensive picture, the experimental                               investigations will be supplemented by theoretical                              studies of the response.  In particular, the electric                           field in a birefringent (bipolar) ellipsoidal droplet                           will be examined in detail numerically.  This will be                           coupled with calculations of the director                                       configuration in the droplets to understand the role                            of the field strength, elastic constants and droplet                            geometry on the director realignment in a droplet.                              These calculations will be applied to recently                                  developed models of the dielectric response and                                 optical transmission for comparison with                                        experimental response curves.",
