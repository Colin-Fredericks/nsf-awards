 "awd_abstract_narration": "A multi-disciplinary project is proposed to determine how                  variations in climate, dust flux, and lithology are genetically                 linked to soil-landscape evolution on alluvial fans in desert                   environments.  Important variables can be examined because the                  study area contains an arid to semi-arid climatic gradient, an                  independent record of Quaternary climate change and dust flux,                  excellent chronostratigraphic resolution, and sequences of                      lithologically distinct deposits (granite, limestone, mixed).  The              project objectives are to:  determine variation in rates of soil-               geomorphic processes among different lithologies, determine spatial             and temporal changes in dust flux, climate, surface permeability,               and soil-water balance, and determine how changes in these factors              control formation of calcic soils.  Soil-geomorphic properties                  related to spatial and temporal changes in climate and dust flux                will be documented through field descriptions and laboratory                    analysis of soils, morphometric measurements of fan-surfaces, and               evaluation of soil and fan-surface hydrology.  A novel approach of              this study will be to integrate empirically measured soil-                      geomorphic properties with computer simulations of soil water                   movement and pedogenic accumulation of carbonate.  Isotopic studies             of soil carbonate will provide additional information concerning                the timing and processes of calcic soil formation and paleoclimate.             Results will provide information for developing criteria for                    recognition of signals of climatic change preserved in soil-                    geomorphic systems, for evaluating the effect of climate change on              the rates of soil-geomorphic components commonly used for age                   estimations, and for developing regional stratigraphic correlations             to other Quaternary deposits in the southwest U.S.",
