 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gametophytes of the fern ceratipteris richardii are either                      hermaphroditic or male.  The primary sex-determining signal in this             and many other ferns is antheridiogen, a gibberellin-like pheromone             that is secreted by the gametophyte.  In its presence, a juvenile               gametophyte develops as a male, whereas in its absence, the                     juvenile develops as a hermaphoxlite.  The primary objective of                 this proposal is to use a combined genetic and molecular approach               to understand how antheridiogen governs the sex of the gametophyte              of Ceratopteris.  The specific objectives are 1) to identify key                regulatory genes involved in sex determination by generating and                characterizing mutations; and 2) to isolate genes whose expression              is altered in response to antheridiogen using a gene expression                 screen which identifies mRNAs that differ in abundance between two              mRNA populations by a subtractive hybridization method; the                     temporal and spatial patterns of their expression will then be                  assessed and their function investigated by expressing their                    antisense cDNA in transgenic plants.                                            %%%                                                                             This analysis of the sex determining process in Ceratopterts may                advance our general understanding of similar processes in higher                plants, and will also relate to more general questions concerning               hormonal control of genes involved in the reproductive development              of all organisms.",
