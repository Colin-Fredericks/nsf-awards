 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Worcester Foundation for                       Experimental Biology to continue a successful Research Experiences              for Undergraduates Site.  The program consists of an intensive                  \"hands-on\" laboratory research experience individualized for each               student and performed under the guidance of working scientists                  expert in many of the traditional and modern areas of biological                sciences.  The program is designed to provide students with their               first exposure to the actual practice of scientific research in the             hopes that the excitement, challenge and creativity of the                      enterprise will convince them to consider basic research in the                 sciences as a viable career choice.  In the spring, each student is             matched with a basic research project initially proposed by a                   preceptor with an active research program in the students stated                area of interest.  Upon acceptance, each student is provided with               a reading list of current publications in the selected area to                  provide the background required for the proposed summer research                project.  During the program students are   1) acquainted with                  current issues in biological research; 2) provided with the                     opportunity to learn and practice valuable scientific techniques                and skills, many of which can be utilized in future endeavors; 3)               guided in shaping the specific research questions to be asked in                each project; 4) required to work independently toward these                    research goals; 5) encouraged in cross disciplinary approaches to               their projects by providing opportunities for interaction with                  other students and the whole of the research staff at the                       Foundation; and 6) provided an educational setting which is                     maximally challenging and thus, fosters exploration of future                   career choices in science.  In addition to the required written                 report detailing the progress made in their individual research                 projects, each student presents a short oral report to the faculty              and public summarizing of the results of their efforts at a closing             minisymposium and award ceremony.",
