The research activity to be supported includes NMR                   studies of the conformation of derivatives of vitamin B12 in                    solution, bound to a vitamin B12 binding protein, and bound to                  a coenzyme B12 requiring enzyme.   Also to be studied are the                   solution conformation of catalytically active fragments (5-10                   kDa) of the enzyme glutamine cyclotransferase in the presence                   and absence of enzyme inhibitors; the distribution of leaf                      chloroplast water and the effects of environmental parameters                   on leaf chloroplast osmoregulation; conformation and tautomeric                 equilibria in carboxylic acids, tin carbamates, N-alkyl                         formamides, alkyl thioformates, alkyl thionitriles,                             N-tert-butylnitramine and N-tert-butylformamide;                                chloroheptafluorodirhenium dianion; cis-and trans-cyclodecene                   by 1H, 13C, 17O, and 19F NMR spectroscopy;  the geometry and                    dynamics of the reversible binding of anilinoacridines and the                  geometry of the covalent binding of photo affinity probes; and                  the solution structure of the 49 amino acid residue                             neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor and the                            conformational changes thereof.                                                                                                                                 %%%                                                                             Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the                  structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                         substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                      useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.",
