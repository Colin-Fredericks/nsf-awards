 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will implement intensive teacher training                    enhancement for approximately 2,400 mathematics teachers of pre-                algebra, algebra, and geometry for eighth, ninth and tenth grade                students.  The teacher training activities, sponsored by a                      partnership between the College Board and the National Science                  Foundation, will take place at six sites in the United States:  Fort            Worth, Texas; Providence, Rhode Island; Nashville, Tennessee; Prince            George's County, Maryland; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and San Jose,                  California.  The NSF-funded component of the partnership will                   involve more than 200,000 students and will involve teachers of                 these students in a series of four-week summer institutes.  These               teacher-oriented institutes will be followed by workshops and                   seminars in the academic year subsequent to the respective summer               programs.  The partners in this venture will offer new and                      innovative mathematics curricula for students that focus on                     educational equity and design intensive institutes and workshops for            teachers to transmit the new curricula.  The principal investigator             of this project is well-qualified academically and has wide                     experiences in managing projects of this nature.",
