 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quinto will pursue problems in the mathematical analysis of                Radon transforms and in tomography with two major objectives.                   The first is to prove injectivity and support theorems for                      generalized radon transforms in the setting of real analytic                    measures on real analytic submanifolds.  The second is to solve                 two problems in tomography. Namely, the non-destructive                         evaluation of rings and rocket exit cones, and a dose plan                      algorithm for cancer radiation therapy.                                              The mathematics in this project is as follows.  Take a                     manifold (surface, solid, or higher dimensional analogue) and a                 function defined on it.  Suppose the manifold is sliced up in                   some fashion and the average of the function over each slice is                 known.  The problem is to reconstruct the original function.  A                 good example is the function that gives the density at each point               of a solid body whose inside is not directly accessible .  X-ray                images give average densities along lines in the direction of the               beam.  Tomography is the science of deducing densities inside the               object from an economical number of these images.",
