 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the outstanding frontiers of contemporary stellar evolution              theory is that brief period of binary star evolution known as the               \"common envelope phase.\"  Prior to this phase, orbiting stars are               attracted closer and closer to one another by the exchange of mass              between them as one of them, then a \"red giant\" expands until the               two stars coalesce, becoming a common \"star\" within which two                   nuclei orbit.   It is thought that the common envelope is                       eventually ejected, leaving behind two distinct stars once again.               The Principal Investigator (PI) intends to build on previous NSF-               supported work on the origins of common envelope systems and now                plans to study the mechanism(s) by which the envelope can be                    expelled.  His models will include effects of circulation and                   cooling (recombination of H, He atoms) of an envelope matter                    through extensive two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations.  This               project is expected to give additional understanding to the                     formation of low mass x-ray binaries and closely orbiting neutron               stars and pulsars, and is thus of interest to a potentially wide                segment of the astronomical community.",
