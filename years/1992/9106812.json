 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will develop realistic stability estimates                \"of Nekhoroshev type\" for nearly integrable Hamiltonian models of               physical systems, beginning with models for the motion of charged               particles in accelerator storage rings.  He uses results from                   averaging theory for ordinary differential equations and from a                 theory for the motion of energetic charged particles based on                   Nekhoroshev-type estimates.  By combining recent progress in                    long-time estimates with quasiconvex unperturbed part (due to                   Lochak and Poeschel), and in averaging theory for ordinary                      differential equations (Ellison, Saenz, and Dumas), he expects to               develop improved estimates for specific model systems.  This                    expectation is based on the way averaging methods are embedded in               Lochak's new approach: his methods reduce the problem --- in what               is probably an optimal way --- to a high-order, single-phase,                   periodic averaging problem of the type for which improved                       estimates were recently developed.                                                   The proposed estimates could prove to be valuable tools in                 the development and design of increasingly complex particle                     accelerators.  Such estimates might augment or even partly                      supplant some of the costly experimental methods now used to                    design and test accelerator lattices (the collections of                        multipole magnetic elements used to stabilize particle beams                    orbiting in accelerator storage rings).  In view of the enormous                development costs of the next generation of accelerators (such as               the Superconducting Super-Collider, now in the initial phases of                construction in Waxahachie, Texas, even as its development                      continues), even a small contribution to the design theory could                result in a sizable savings of time and money.  Moreover,                       estimates of the same type might be useful in much the same way                 in the design and development of \"toroidal confinement fusion                   machines\" (hot fusion reactors).",
