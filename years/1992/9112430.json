 "awd_abstract_narration": "To exercise leadership, science and engineering educators need to               provide their students with the tools to identify and respond                   appropriately to professional problems with ethical dimensions.                 This project is a pilot study to develop innovative materials for               engineering faculty to use to introduce issues of engineering                   ethics into their classrooms.  The faculty will develop case study              materials based on their own professional experiences.  They will               be prepared to develop the case studies and to discuss ethical                  issues with their students through a series of workshops and                    extensive individual consultation with the project director.  The               case studies and experiential essays based on the teaching                      experiences will be published and disseminated to the engineering               schools.  Presentations will be made at appropriate professional                meetings.  The pilot study will also investigate the possibility                of broadening the ethics program to a larger group of campuses,                 through liaison with the Midwest Undergraduate Private Engineering              Colleges.                                                                                                                                                       This proposal focuses on an important area in Ethics and Values                 Studies.  The investigator is very well qualified; the plan is                  thoughtful and feasible; university support is extremely good.                  Results are likely to improve the teaching of engineering ethics                on this campus and in undergraduate curricula nationwide.  Support              is highly recommended.",
