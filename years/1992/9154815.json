 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Community of Explorers project will develop and study                       the growth of a new kind of wide-area computer network for                      high school biology and physics instruction.  The network                       will support a distributed community of teachers, students                      and scientists who will share ideas for classroom                               investigators and instructional activities in physics and                       biology.  They will also share concrete exemplars of how                        these topics can be investigated using Explorer, a modeling                     and simulation program.                                                                                                                                         Our experiment in building a community of explorers will                        focus on a communications technology that will make it                          straightforward to send and receive Explorer laboratories                       that convey all the parameters and data of a simulation                         experiment in progress along with an optional text                              annotation.  We have two related hypotheses.  The first is                      that a distributed community in which teachers can exchange                     the actual \"live\" experiments and data from their classes                       will be more robust and educationally productive than a                         network over which teachers can exchange only text, or which                    is designed primarily as a delivery system.  Second, that                       teachers will use Explorer more effectively and will take                       advantage of its extensibility to a greater extent with the                     support of a networked community than those who use Explorer                    locally in their schools without networking facilities for                      communication with others in the Explorer user community.",
