 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project encompasses four distinct, but interrelated areas of               research in probabilistic functional limit theory.  They are: (1)               optimal tests of parameter constancy, (2) median unbiased                       estimation and confidence interval construction for nonstationary               time series, (3) empirical process limit theory for dependent                   non-identically distributed random variables, and (4)                           semiparametric econometric methods.  The results of this research               will provide powerful, new tools for applied economic analysis                  including research on the economics of global environmental                     change.                                                                                                                                                         The proposed work on parameter constancy covers tests of                        structural change with an unknown change point and tests of                     regime switching.  This part of the project is important because                there currently are no asymptotically optimal tests available for               testing for parameter constancy when the standard regularity                    conditions fail.  The proposed research on median unbiased                      estimation and confidence interval construction is significant                  because current tests have low power.  The new tools developed                  under this project can be used to provide analysts more                         information for the types of time series problems that are                      frequently encountered in empirical economics.  The basic limit                 results for dependent non-identically distributed random                        variables also have applications in a wide variety of time series               econometric problems.  In the fourth area of research the project               develops tests for heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation,                         asymptotic normality for semiparametric and nonparametric                       estimators.  Semiparametric estimators are widely used by                       economists because the data for many economic problems do not fit               the assumptions required for standard parametric analysis and                   these new tests can be used for a very wide range of                            semiparametric estimators.  These methods are especially                        appropriate for the type of forecasting and empirical analytical                problems encountered in the economics of global change because of               the poor quality of the data, the uncertainty about many of the                 underlying economic relationships, and the possibility of changes               in the structure of the economic system being studied.",
