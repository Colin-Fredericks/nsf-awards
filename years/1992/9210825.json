 "awd_abstract_narration": "Democracy is often idealized as a system in which citizens have                 clear issue preferences, know where the parties stand on issues,                and cast their ballots accordingly.  Parties then pursue the                    policies expected of them.  In such a system there is a direct                  connection between the issue preferences of citizens, party choice,             and public policy.  The spatial theory of elections is a natural                representation of this classic concept.  In the theory, liking of               candidates is based on closeness to their issue positions.  The                 theory requires two important assumptions:  that people have                    specific positions on an issue and that those positions can be                  arrayed along a continuum.  For example, on the issue of defense                spending, each person would have an exact level of spending they                most prefer.  Empirical research has found that voters are not well             enough informed about politics for these assumptions to be                      realistic.                                                                      An alternate view is that democracy is a system which provides                  citizen input for resolving social conflicts.  Sources of conflict              or cleavage are abundant in any society.  They can be related to                demographic differences such as rich versus poor, Protestant versus             Catholic, or management versus labor.  They can be rooted in                    ideological and issue divisions such as egalitarians versus                     individualists, environmentalists versus materialists, or pro-                  choice versus pro-life.  If the substance of politics is conflict,              an appropriate role for parties is advocacy.  Effective parties are             effective advocates, and elections decide which side has greater                weight in determining policy.                                                   The directional theory of issue voting is a natural vehicle for                 modeling conflict-oriented politics.  In this theory, issues are                understood as a choice between two alternatives.  Voters may favor              a policy, oppose it, or be neutral.  This is a less demanding role              for voters and more in line with empirical evidence.  In                        directional theory, when voters choose, they do not ask \"how close              are your positions to mine?\"  Rather they ask, \"are you on my                   side?\" and \"can I trust you to be responsible?\"                                 Both the directional and spatial theories can be represented                    mathematically and tested empirically.  In prior research by the                research team on the United States and Norway, the empirical                    evidence has clearly favored directional theory.  In this                       continuation the researchers further develop and empirically test               this theory.  Specifically the investigators will: (1) examine the              relationship between left-right ideology and support for political              parties in several European countries; (2) test the discounting                 hypothesis; and, (3) test the rationalization hypothesis, i.e. the              spatial model states that voters prefer candidates who are close                to them on the issues but may rationalize candidate issue positions             and assume they are close to them on the issues.                                This research promises to refine further our understanding of the               relationship between directional theory and spatial theory",
