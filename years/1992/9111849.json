 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin - Madison has a long tradition                 in logic and the foundations of mathematics, starting  with                     Stephen Kleene in 1936.  Currently, there are five faculty                      members in logic and foundations:  H. Jerome Keisler, Kenneth                   Kunen, Steffen Lempp, Terrence Millar, and Arnold Miller; as well               as Mary Ellen Rudin, who works in set-theoretical topology.                     Together they supervise the theses of more than a dozen graduate                students, and their logic colloquium has an average attendance of               over twenty, not only faculty and graduate students from                        the University of Wisconsin but also logicians from                             nearby universities  and colleges, including Paul Bankston, Wim                 Ruitenburg, and John Simms from Marquette University, Milwaukee;                Donna Carr from the University of Wisconsin-Parkside; and Philip                Steitz from Beloit College.                                                          The purpose of the logic colloquium is threefold:  to allow                the logic faculty of the University of Wisconsin and of                         nearby universities and colleges to present their work to                       their colleagues and students; to give graduate students at                     the University of Wisconsin a chance to talk about their thesis                 work in logic and foundations; and to provide a forum for outside               visitors to speak.  It currently meets every other week for two                 one hour talks, with additional times scheduled for outside                     speakers, who last year included:  Menachem Magidor of Hebrew                   University , Jerusalem; Chris Laskowski of the University of                    Maryland-College Park; Sergio Fajardo of the University of the                  Andes, Bogota; and Ali Enayat of American University, Washington                D.C. In each case, the outside speakers happened to pass through                Madison or Chicago and agreed to speak.  In order for the                       organizers to function more effectively, NSF funds are being                    provided to invite one speaker a month for each of the nine                     months of the next three academic years.",
