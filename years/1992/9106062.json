 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is not always clear how to use parallel machines in an optimal way.          Intuitively, parallelism may help because we may be able to perform             several components of the computation simultaneously.  However, such            components usually are subject to precedence relations that do not              allow some components to be started before some other components have           been completed.  The reason is that each component may need results             produced by some other components in order to start.  A major open              problem is how to map programs to parallel architectures so that the            total time (computation plus communication) is minimized (up to a               constant factor), and the number of processors used to achieve this             optimal time is minimized (up to a constant factor).  The PI will               investigate this problem.  Another important problem that will be               investigated is optimizing the time and number of processors if only            the problem, rather than a program that solves it, is given.  To the            extent possible, a general method, that works for every architecture,           will be designed.  However, some important aspects of parallel                  computation seem to require a closer look at the particular                     architectures.",
