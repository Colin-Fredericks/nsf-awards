 "awd_abstract_narration": "Performance of computer vision algorithms is contingent upon the                quality of the input.  With uncorrupted data most of the                        algorithms perform well, however, once noise is present the                     results may become unreliable.  The noise can appear as                         uncertainty about the input and/or incorrect assumptions about                  the underlying model structure.  A robust computer vision                       algorithm should tolerate both types of noise.  The methods                     borrowed from statistics or estimation theory were not designed                 for visual data where resistance to data uncertainty and                        tolerance of incorrect assumptions are of paramount importance.                 Good performance for noisy visual data can only be achieved                     through robust detection of the consensus among the outputs of a                large number of identical non-robust processes, with a                          methodology called the Consensus Paradigm.  A similarity exist                  between the computational steps of recently proposed 3D object                  recognition algorithms and the robust estimation methods.  The                  research will exploit this similarity and develop object                        recognition algorithms with improved noise resistance.  Results                 of the research will contribute to the development of techniques                for autonomous decision making in unfamiliar visual environments.",
