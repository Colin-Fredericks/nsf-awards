 "awd_abstract_narration": "Life history patterns in benthic marine invertebrates                      display tremendous diversity.  This diversity can be found among                species living in different habitats or within the same habitat.                In this research project the P.I. will study the influence of                   life-history patterns, environment, and phylogeny on the genetic                structure of ahermatypic (lacking symbiotic algae and non-reef                  building) scleractinian corals from the west coast of North                     America and the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Panama by                       examining: 1) population-genetic structure of co-occurring                      species with different life-history traits, 2) effects of larval                behavior and dispersal on genetic variation and population                      relatedness (local gene flow), 3) genetic affinities of closely                 related species (congenerics) from contrasting environments.                         The goal of this project is to adapt molecular techniques                  for studies of coral population genetics, evolutionary ecology,                 and systematics.  This study will use a series of molecular                     techniques (restriction endonuclease patterns of nuclear                        ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA, polymerase chain reaction, DNA                 sequencing and DNA fingerprinting) to examine relatedness at                    several phylogenetic levels.  Three genera/ten species of                       ahermatypic corals have been chosen because they are diverse and                abundant in temperate and tropical oceans (from shallow to deep                 water), and they display different patterns of growth (solitary                 and colonial) and reproduction (free spawning with pelagic larvae               and brooding with benthic larvae).  The results of this study                   will provide information on the selective forces acting on life                 history patterns, gene flow within and among populations, and                   models of speciation in the sea.",
