 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on two fundamental areas of                        nonlinear mathematical analysis involving integrable systems of                 differential equations.  Particular emphasis is placed on the                   relationship between eigenvalue algorithms and Hamiltonian                      mechanics. The first concerns the asymptotics of the oscillatory                Riemann-Hilbert problems of the kind that arise in the theory of                integrable nonlinear wave equations.  Work will be done                         exploiting a newly developed steepest descent method to study the               zero dispersion limit of the Korteweg de Vries equation,                        integrable statistical models such as the transverse Ising chain                at critical magnetic field and spatially discrete problems, such                as the Toda lattice.  Work will also continue on the eigenvalue                 algorithms in the context of integrable systems.  It was shown                  earlier how the basic diagonalization of finite dimensional                     matrices can be realized as flows on manifolds.  A framework has                been developed in which many well known systems of physical and                 mathematical interest can be embedded.  One focus of this                       investigation will be to place the recent theory of Moser and                   Veselov describing a class of variational problems that can be                  solved by a generalized QR factorization into the framework of                  Hamiltonian flows. The principal object of this research is the                 analysis of systems of differential equations arising from models               of the physical world and the application of that analysis to                   studies of finite dimensional matrix theory; in particular the                  development of new, computationally effective means for                         diagonalization of matrices.                                                         Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them and validate methods for                     expressing solutions.",
