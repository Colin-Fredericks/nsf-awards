Support for the participation of European                       scientists has already been obtained from NATO.                                                                                                                 Molecules involved in the individual steps of membrane traffic are              being identified and their functions defined at an amazingly rapid              rate.  This conference will concentrate on the membrane transport               steps where molecular detail is available, and draw from data                   obtained in plant, yeast, and mammalian systems.  The membrane                  traffic field is expanding and fewer students and postdoctoral                  fellows are selected for participation at the major, limited-                   attendance meetings, such as Gordon Research Conferences.                       Communication between young scientists and leaders in the field is              an essential element of training; therefore, this conference will               focus on providing these interactions for students and postdoctoral             fellows.  The meeting will accommodate 150 scientists and is                    designed to encourage maximal interaction among participants.  This             award will provide scholarships for young and minority scientists               to attend the meeting.",
