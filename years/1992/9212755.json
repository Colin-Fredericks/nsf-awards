 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of eusociality presents a major paradox for                       evolutionary biology because it requires the evolution of sterile               individuals.  The aphid tribe Cerataphidini provides an ideal                   opportunity to investigate the evolution of eusociality because the             group is polymorphic for a relatively primitive form of                         eusociality, the production of a reproductively sterile \"soldier\"               caste.  To examine the origins of eusociality, the PIs will first               reconstruct a phylogeny for the cerataphidine aphids using DNA                  sequence data and then map onto this phylogeny behavioral                       ecological data pertinent to the evolution of a soldier caste.  The             PIs will test several hypotheses for the evolution of a soldier                 caste by testing for significant associations among these variables             and soldier production using recently developed statistical                     methods.  The PIs propose to return to field sites where species of             aphids included in the phylogeny have been collected to measure                 variables that are believed critical to understanding the evolution             of their social behavior.  The PIs will first sample colonies of                each species for later genetic analysis to estimate the average                 relatedness within and between colonies.  Taking into account both              spatial and temporal variation, the PIs will then measure                       individual birth rates, soldier production, ant interaction,                    predation and parasitism.  The information obtained will be useful              in understanding both fundamental questions about sociality and the             population success or failure it brings to this group of plant                  feeders.",
