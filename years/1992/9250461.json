 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order for mechanical engineers to make informed choices                     with respect to material selection they need a solid                            understanding of the relationships between material structures,                 properties, and processing.  To accomplish this objective, an                   undergraduate Engineering Materials course has been                             restructured and student-conducted laboratory experiments have                  been added.  The unique approach taken in the laboratory is                     first to select representative materials from each of the three                 basic classes of materials (metals, ceramics, and polymers),                    and then concurrently characterize these materials with a                       series of experiments which include microstructure morphology                   determination, microconstituent properties, bulk mechanical                     properties, and the effects of processing on structure and                      properties.  By following the same set of materials through the                 same sequence of experiments, the students will more easily                     grasp the concepts of structure-property interrelationships.                    The result will be graduates who are more capable of making                     intelligent materials selection decisions for design                            applications. The project provides devices for examining and                    characterizing the materials on a microstructural scale, a                      uniaxial test machine, equipment for studying time-dependent                    deformation, and state-of-the-art data acquisition systems.",
