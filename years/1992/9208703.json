 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                      Organometallic Chemistry Program, involves a combined                           experimental and theoretical study of the photochemical                         reactions of a variety of dinuclear metal carbonyl complexes.                   The objective of the study is to develop a detailed                             understanding of the elementary processes that accompany                        absorption of a photon by the organometallic molecule and how                   these are affected by changes in the ligands.  The research                     will proceed with conventional preparative scale photolyses,                    matrix isolation, and flash photolysis studies of several                       series of dinuclear compounds in which the bridging ligands,                    terminal ligands and metal atoms are varied.  These studies                     will be followed by detailed, ultrafast laser studies designed                  to probe the elementary processes.  In addition to monitoring                   by conventional visible spectroscopy, picosecond, transient                     Raman scattering and infrared techniques will also be used in                   order to obtain structural information concerning transient                     intermediates.  Finally, molecular dynamics will be modeled via                 theoretical electronic structure calculations using both                        approximate and ab initio computational methods.                                %%%                                                                             This research is designed to experimentally and theoretically                   investigate events that occur extremely rapidly following                       absorption of a photon by an organometallic compound. Through                   the combination of experimental and theoretical studies to be                   utilized it is expected that our understanding of these events                  will develop to the point that in the future predictions can be                 made about how the reactivity of an organometallic compound                     will be affected by changes in the groups attached to the metal                 atom.  Ultimately these results may be important in the                         synthesis of new materials and in the design of new catalysts.",
