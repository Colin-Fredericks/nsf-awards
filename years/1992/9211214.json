 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well established that bone is remodeled in response to                    loading patterns.  The two most influential loads for limb bones                are those incurred during locomotion and those due to body size.                Whereas the impact of body size (weight) on limb bone morphology                has been studied in a variety of animals, few studies have paired               an analysis of forces generated during locomotion (kinetics) with               an examination of bone structures associated with strength and                  rigidity under loading (structural mechanics).  This study will                 analyze the kinetics of locomotion in rodents (guinea pigs,                     chinchillas, agoutis, pacas, and Patagonian hares), representing                slow to fast running species and small (under 2 lbs.) to large (20              lbs.) body sizes.  The animals will be allowed to run freely in an              enclosure fitted with a force plate that will record the forces                 generated by the limbs during locomotion.  Forelimb and hind limb               forces and impulses in all five species will be tested for                      differences as a result of locomotor pattern, locomotor speed, and              body size.  The principal investigator has already completed a                  study of buttressing patterns in the long bone shafts of these                  rodents and will accordingly match kinetic data with structual                  data.  The most significant consequence of the study, therefore,                will be in forming a bridge between kinetic performance and                     observed anatomy which can then be used to understand the                       structural adaptations of any bone, including human.",
