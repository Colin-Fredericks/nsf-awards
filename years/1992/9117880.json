 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultimate aim of this work is the understanding of the                  rheology of the mantle and the conditions there which are                       responsible for plate motion.  The movement of tectonic plates must             be accommodated by flow in Earth's mantle.  This flow occurs in the             solid state and in turn must be accommodated by the motion of                   defects within crystals and along grain boundaries.  As seismic                 strain waves traverse the mantle they interact with these defects               which results in attenuations.  This study is aimed at gaining an               understanding of the interaction of seismic waves with defects in               single crystals of mantle minerals.  An experimental apparatus has              been developed to measure the attenuation of strain waves at                    seismic strains and frequencies and under mantle conditions of                  temperature and chemical environment.  Olivine has been chosen as               the first minerals to be studied because of its proposed abundance              in the mantle and because it is quite deformable under mantle                   conditions.  The state of stress in Earth's mantle is probably the              major factor controlling the defect structure there.  An                        understanding of that structure, gained through the comparison of               laboratory attenuation measurements with seismic data, should                   eventually yield stress mapping of Earth's mantle.",
