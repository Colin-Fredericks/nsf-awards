Working models are defined as cognitive and                        affective representations based on parents' current conceptions                 of their childhood relationships with their own parents.  These                 models guide parents' strategies for accessing and organizing                   information about  ttachment-related experiences, and thereby                   influence their overall quality of child care.  This project will               explore: 1) the stability of parents' working models over time,                 and links between parents' working models and their personality                 characteristics; 2) how working models forecast particular                      patterns of parent-child interactions; and 3) how working models                and caregiving patterns affect children's developing social-                    emotional competence.  Mothers' and fathers' models of attachment               will be assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview prenatally,               and when their firstborn is 24-months old.  Measures of both                    parents' personality characteristics will be obtained prenatally                to see how they relate to their working models.  Caregiving                     quality will be assessed by videotaping parent-child interactions               when the child is 8 and 24 months old.  Finally, children's                     social emotional competence will be examined by assessing                       attachment security in infancy and autonomy in problem-solving in               toddlerhood.",
