The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit              by Dr. Cynthia D. Trowbridge to visit Dr. Robert Creese at the                  University of Auckland, Leigh Marine Laboratory.                                                                                                                Dr. Trowbridge proposed to study the population ecology of                      oligophagous ascoglossan sea slugs (Mollusca:  Gastropoda:                      Opisthobranchia).  She has already documented the population                    ecology of several species of intertidal ascoglossans in the N.E.               Pacific.  She now proposes to collect complementary information                 for three ecologically similar species in the Hauraki Gulf region of            the North Island of New Zealand to address the following three                  questions.  First, do ascoglossans seasonally reduce algal host                 abundances?  Second, does interspecific competition among                       generalist and specialist herbivores reduce the effect of ascoglossan           herbivory?  Third, do fish and crab predators significantly reduce              ascoglossan densities in the field?  This study will provide valuable           information about the role of marine specialists on temperate rocky             shores.                                                                                                                                                         The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel, a stipend for twelve months, and a dependent allowance.",
