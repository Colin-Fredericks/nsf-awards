 "awd_abstract_narration": "Farvardin         The basic idea of this research is to develop a class of  suboptimal vector quantizers in which the codebook is derived, in  a simple manner, from another highly structured codebook,  therefore, eliminating the need to store the codebook and hence  allowing the design of very large codebooks. For memoryless  sources, the codebook of the Structured Vector Quantization (SVQ)  is selected as a well-defined subset of the Cartesian product of  the codebook of a specific entropy-coded scalar quantizer.  Since  the SVQ codebook is a part of a highly structured codebook, the  memory requirements, the complexity, and the needed training data  are reduced significantly, hence, allowing the possibility of  designing SVQs with large codebooks.         The research plan entails the design, analysis and  simulation of SVQs, along with a meaningful comparison of their  merits with respect to other known quantization schemes.  Based  on the results of this research, the application and performance  of SVQs in more practical situations representative of real-world  problems will be studied.",
