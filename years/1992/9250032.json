 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mayville State University seeks funds to develop a model                        Mathematics Specialist Program for grades K-8.  A preservice                    teacher preparation program will be designed, developed and                     tested for implementation in North Dakota and Western                           Minnesota elementary schools.  With adjustments, the                            preservice program will also serve inservice teachers who will                  be prepared as mathematics specialists and mathematics                          stewards for their schools.  Through a cooperative arrangement                  with twelve area school districts and four Native American                      Reservations, the university will prepare inservice teachers                    as mathematics specialists and will define the role of a                        mathematics curriculum steward:  an individual with a                           mathematics concentration, who is a professional advocate and                   a counselor in mathematics education, and provides on-site                      consultant service to improve and coordinate mathematics                        instruction throughout their schools.  Program evaluation will                  be an integral part of the development process and an active                    dissemination network will be developed for purposes of                         educating teachers throughout North Dakota and the region.                      The goal of the program is to implement the NCTM Curriculum                     and Evaluation Standards in over 1,000 elementary classrooms                    by 1997.  National experts in mathematics education will                        assist the proposers in the development and implementation of                   the project.                                                                                                                                                    The contribution of Mayville State University accounts for 53%                  of the NSF budget.",
