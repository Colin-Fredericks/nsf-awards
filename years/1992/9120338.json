 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea turtle hatchlings emerge from underground nests on sandy                    oceanic beaches, scramble to the sea, and swim toward the open                  ocean in a migration lasting several days.  During the migration,               hatchlings quickly establish a seaward course, then hold this                   heading even after they swim beyond sight of land.                                                                                                              Little is known about how hatchling sea turtles can maintain a                  straight course through a vast ocean that contains no obvious                   landmarks.  Recent experiments have revealed that hatchling                     loggerhead sea turtles from the Atlantic coast of Florida can                   detect the magnetic field of the earth and use it as a cue to                   guide their migration.  Dr. Lohmann's experiments are designed to               study the newly discovered magnetic compass sense of sea turtle                 hatchlings and to provide insight into how sea turtles use                      magnetic cues in navigation.                                                                                                                                    All species of sea turtles are now either endangered or                         threatened.  Dr. Lohmann's research is expected to provide                      information useful to conservation workers trying to save sea                   turtles from extinction.  In addition, it is expected to help                   scientists understand how other migratory animals (such as birds,               fish, and whales) use information from the earth's magnetic field               to navigate.",
