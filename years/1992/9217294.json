 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hannes Jonsson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                     and Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry                            Division, the Materials Theory Program in the Division of                       Materials Research, and the New Technologies Program in the                     Division of Advanced Scientific Computing to develop                            scalable, portable computational algorithms for performing                      Car-Parrinello (CP) simulations on MIMD computers.  This                        grant is part of the Computational Approaches to Real                           Materials initiative in Division of Materials Research and                      the High Performance Computing and Communications                               Initiative.  Jonnson will optimize the CP code for massively                    parallel computers, and use it to perform simulation studies                    of short range order in Silicon and Aluminum bulk liquids                       and solid-liquid interfaces.  For comparison with these                         first principles simulations, Jonnson will also carry out                       Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics Simulations using                            empirical potential functions, in particular the Stillinger-                    Weber potential for Silicon and and Embedded Atom Method                        potential for Aluminum.                                                         %%%                                                                             A molecular level understanding of the atomic and molecular                     interactions is of key importance in the rational design of                     new materials.  Theoretical and computational approaches to                     this problem will be significantly enhanced through the use                     of massively parallel computers.  The Car-Parrinello                            methodology shows great promise as a first principles                           approach to understanding such interactions, but its                            applications are currently limited by the speed of vector                       processors.  Jonnson proposes to adapt the Car-Parrinello                       algorithms for massively parallel computers which should                        significantly enhance their applicability to more complex                       materials systems.",
