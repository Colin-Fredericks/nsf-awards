 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theory of Interacting Fermi Systems - The objective of the project              is to acquire a deeper understanding of electron-electron                       interactions and their manifestations in solids.  One approach                  toward this goal will be the study of physical properties which                 have been found to exhibit unexpected anomalous behavior, e.g.,                 phenomena which can be attributed to broken symmetries caused by                electron-electron interactions.  Specific topics proposed for study             include the longitudinal Hall effect in K at very low temperatures,             ultraviolet optical anomalies in alkali metals, two magnon exchange             in antiferromagnetic superconductors, phonon anomalies (possibly                related to spin density waves) in zinc, cadmium, and technetium,                fractional crystallization in 'optical molasses', and                           perpendicular-field cyclotron-resonance transmission in simple                  metals.                                                                         %%%                                                                             The best-established model descriptions for the behavior of                     electrons in solids are based on a picture where electrons are                  nearly independent of each other.  Although such a viewpoint is                 quite successful, there are nevertheless a large number of                      important phenomena which cannot be explained properly by this                  approach.  When electron-electron interactions become important,                new theoretical descriptions must be developed.  This project is                aimed at developing such descriptions for a range of phenomena                  which appear experimentally and appear to depend explicitly on                  electron-electron interactions.",
