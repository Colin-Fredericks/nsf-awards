One result of the recent political and economic changes is              that large volumes of irreplaceable historical marine environmental             data are at serious risk of bring lost to global research programs.             Included in these data are long-term observation of high potential              value to ocean science programs such as WOCE, JGOFS and other                   climate change studies.                                                                                                                                         The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), through             its Environmental Information Services, is working with                         counterpart groups of the FSU. Initial program efforts are                      emphasizing oceanographic data rescue, quality  control and data                intercomparison. Additional collaborative efforts between U.S. and              FSU researchers are developing new data access and display                      techniques, technical applications in support of joint research                 efforts, and new information products.                                                                                                                          This project is part of the US-USSR-(Russia) Agreement on                       Cooperation in Ocean Studies.",
