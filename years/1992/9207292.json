The                               focus of its research is on complex, policy-relevant                            problems that transcend the interests of single                                 countries.  The U.S. National Committee for IIASA,                              comprised of distinguished scientists and policy                                experts, has been important to the implementation of a                          December 1989 Presidential determination that IIASA's                           research directions should be redirected towards                                issues of concern to the United States, with a                                  specific emphasis on global change research.  In                                particular, the Committee was instrumental in helping                           to develop a 10-year strategic plan which was                                   officially adopted by the IIASA Council in June 1991.                           This grant will permit the Committee to continue and                            intensify its activities by: (1) providing support for                          its Executive Directorate, housed at the American                               Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge,                                      Massachusetts; (2) funding domestic travel for members                          to participate in meetings of the committee; (3)                                funding foreign travel to permit qualified U.S.                                 scientists to make short-term visits to IIASA as a                              means for addressing an objective of the committee to                           intensify involvement of the U.S. scientific community                          in IIASA's work; and (4) supporting the participation                           of up to eight outstanding advanced U.S. graduate                               students in IIASA's Young Scientist Program during the                          summer of 1992.",
