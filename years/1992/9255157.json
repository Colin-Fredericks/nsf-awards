The overall goal of the Center is to continue                         a strong research effort in membrane biology as a                               vehicle through minority junior high, high school, and                          college students can develop strong interest in a                               science career.  In addition the center will continue to                        develop strategies to strengthen partnerships with                              industry and academic.  Research results have shown an                          explosion of knowledge which elucidates the molecular                           mechanisms and structures that are responsible for                              complex processes such as cell growth and division,                             metabolism, differentiations, and development.  More                            significantly, the new methods that have developed                              concurrently with this knowledge provide a way to                               manipulate molecules and observe biochemical changes in                         living systems.                                                                                                                                                 The project meets the major goal of the Minority                                Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program: to                               increase the minority presence in science and                                   engineering by making substantial resources available to                        upgrade the research capabilities of strong and                                 productive minority institutions.  This project will                            allow the institution to continue to use research as a                          tool to increase the effectiveness of related science                           and engineering activities for minority group in its                            region.  In addition, the project will provide                                  opportunities for minority faculty and students at                              Meharry and nearby institutions to engage in meritorious                        research that leads to publications in refereed                                 journals.",
