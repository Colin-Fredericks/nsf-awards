Methods will include: 1) participant-                      observation in homes and medical settings in a small town, and 2)               recording of complaints to be submitted to 3) ethnographic                      discourse analysis.  Discourse analysis will focus on the form                  and function of the complaints as speech acts.  Off-record goals                of these acts will be explored through conversation-internal                    indications and in interviews (with participants and others).                   Defining characteristics of \"health complaints\" will be                         described.  Parameters of variation to be explored include gender               and relative age of speakers and hearers and the nature of the                  speech setting (home versus medical).  Analysis will produce                    taxonomic, pragmatic, and cultural-symbolic models for the                      understanding of complaints in their contexts.  Because                         complaints-- particularly by females-- may themselves be viewed                 as selfish actions by Bengalis (particularly males), models will                relate complaints to ideals and actualities of self-other                       boundaries, much discussed in South Asian ethnography.                          Psychological and medical anthropologists in South Asia have                    considered whether somatic symptoms can be considered indirect                  expressions of social or psychological distress; the research                   will uncover linguistic and other behavioral evidence relevant to               this question.",
