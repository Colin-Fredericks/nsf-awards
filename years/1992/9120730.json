 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project considers the cellular mechanisms underlying                       development and experience-dependent plasticity in the visual                   system of mammals.  An in vitro slice preparation is employed and               dye-filled electrodes are used to record intracellularly and label              immature (visually-naive) neurons and neurons affected by visual                deprivation.  The focus is the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus                (LGN) which is the thalamic relay between the retina and the visual             cortex.  The LGN is the most peripheral site along the visual                   pathway where severe morphological and physiological deficits                   develop in response to brief periods of visual deprivation during               the critical period of development.  Its functional organization                is well-known and its neurophil simpler than that of more central               structures such as the visual cortex, thus making it more amenable              for analysis.  There are two main goals of Dr. Guido's research.                His first goal is to examine the cellular integrative properties                of visually-deprived LGN neurons, and then to determine the degree              to which any changes in these properties correlate with the                     reported morphological abnormalities.  His second goal is to study              the postnatal development of these properties to determine the                  extent to which their normal expression depends on visual                       experience during the critical period of development.  The specific             properties that Dr. Guido will be examining are membrane properties             and synaptic events, especially those that rely on the activation               of the glutamatergic-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.  This project               is important from the point of view of understanding the origin of              visual deficits in humans.***//",
