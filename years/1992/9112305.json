 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sulloway is continuing his research on why scientists accept                or reject new theories.  Often scientists, in possession of the                 same relevant facts, nevertheless take diametrically opposed                    viewpoints toward theoretical innovations.  The research design of              this study, which is multivariate in nature, seeks to assess the                role of 80 different background factors in mediating how several                thousand scientists have responded to 30 highly diverse                         controversies in the history of science.  Under this grant, Dr.                 Sulloway is using questionnaire data drawn from participants in                 three recent scientific controversies (cold fusion, continental                 drift, and sociobiology) to illuminate the central role played by               patterns of identification with authority in mediating attitudes                toward innovation.  This information provides a direct test of the              hypothesis that birth order, the single best predictor of the 80                considered in this study, is a powerful mediator of identification              with parents, and through parents, with authority.  He is also                  investigating the way in which scientists respond to novel claims               made on behalf of spurious, difficult-to-detect, or nonexistent                 phenomena.  By studying reactions to the \"discovery\" of N-rays and              response to the recent claims on behalf of \"cold fusion,\" Dr.                   Sulloway is highlighting the role that complex patterns of                      subjective influences can play in shaping attitudes toward                      scientific innovation.",
