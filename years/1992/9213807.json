 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of the electronic piezocone penetrometer (PCPT) as a                    potential insitu testing device to evaluate engineering soil                    parameters is gaining wide acceptance.  Improvements in the                     design of this device have made it possible to measure                          simultaneously pore water pressure, cone resistance and sleeve                  friction.  However, interpretation of piezocone (PCPT) data is                  often complex as it is influenced by a number of variables                      related to the design of the cone, testing procedures and soil                  characteristics.  No standards have been accepted regarding                     the pore pressure element size and location, which has a                        significant effect on the magnitude of the measured pore                        pressures.                                                                                                                                                      This research program is a comprehensive experimental                           investigation using homogeneous and reproducible soil                           specimens instrumented to monitor the spatial distribution                      of pore water pressure.  Piezocone penetration tests are                        performed under strictly controlled boundary conditions                         in a clay calibration chamber system.  The objectives                           are: 1) To conduct very comprehensive and detailed parametric                   studies to expand the currently available limited data base of                  piezocone penetration tests in clay, 2) compare existing theories               and interpretation procedures to assess their relative merits and               demerits, and 3) to compare the results with available field                    data.                                                                                                                                                           The aim is to resolve the complexities currently met during the                 interpretation of piezocone test data and to assist in the                      verification of future proposed theories.",
