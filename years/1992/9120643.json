 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal we discuss algorithms for solving                              high-order numerical problems that arise in the                                 design of control laws for systems modeled with                                 large numbers of variables (parameters, inputs,                                 outputs, states, etc.).  Particular attention is focused                        on certain key matrix equations arising in state-                               space-based control engineering.  The most                                      common such equations are Lyapunov and Riccati                                  equations, and their effective numerical solution is                            described in detail, although our techniques also                               apply more generally.  Considerable discussion is                               focused on large-scale matrix problems, including                               those in which the matrices are sparse or                                       structured.  In addition to continuing our research                             on algorithms for implementation on vector                                      supercomputers such as the Cray Y-MP for which                                  coarse-grained parallelism can also be exploited,                               we proposing now to extend our efforts to                                       computers such as the Connection Machine with                                   massive parallelism.  Much of our proposed                                      research is intended to lay the groundwork for the                              next generation of computer-aided control system                                design and analysis software.",
