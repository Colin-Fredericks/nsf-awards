 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cayley graph of a group G with respect to a set of                     generators A is the graph whose vertices are the elements of G, and             such that for each g in G and each generator a in A, an edge runs               from g to ga labeled with the generator a.  This graph has                      topological and geometric properties which are often related to                 properties of the group G and independent of the set of generators.             Gromov's notion of \"negatively curved\" group, for example, can be               stated in terms of the Cayley graph as saying that there is a fixed             number c such that in each triangle of shortest paths in the Cayley             graph, each edge of the triangle is within the c-neighborhood of                the union of the other two edges.  There are various other                      properties which can be described in similar terms, although the                definitions are not quite so simple, usually.  One of the most                  interesting is a property invented by Stephen G. Brick which he                 calls \"qsf\"; given a group-presentation, one constructs the 2-                  complex which is described, having the given group as fundamental               group; one asks whether arbitrarily large neighborhoods of the                  identity in the universal cover can be faithfully represented (in               a certain technical sense) by finite, 1-connected complexes mapping             into the universal cover; if so, the group is said to be \"quasi-                simply-filtrated\" or qsf.  There are generalizations of some                    results of Poenaru and Casson, so that one has a theorem to the                 effect that if an aspherical, P2-irreducible, closed 3-manifold has             fundamental group which is qsf, then its universal cover is                     homeomorphic to R3.                                                                  These and related notions have produced a revolution in the                theory of infinite groups within the last few years.  The basic                 pattern seems to be that one finds some facts in differential                   geometry and topology of 3-manifolds; one abstracts to the                      fundamental group level, and then one finds group-theoretic                     theorems which sometimes have a reverse application to topology.                In addition, the subject tends to have a connection with the                    computability of the Cayley graph itself; the Todd-Coxeter                      algorithm for finite groups thus extends to various kinds of                    computability questions about finite Cayley graphs.  The theory of              \"automatic groups\" involves finite-state automata and regular                   languages; this theory, however, does not apply to certain easily               understood groups such as nilpotent groups and matrix groups over               the integers; in order to understand these, one needs to extend the             notion of a finite-state machine in certain very restricted ways                which are not yet obvious.  Perhaps this will have implications in              formal language theory and other aspects of mathematics usually                 considered to be \"computer science.\"",
