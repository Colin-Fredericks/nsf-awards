 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Diana Archangeli will use a grant from the NSF Faculty Awards               for Women Program to continue her research in phonological                      theory, the theory governing the sound systems of natural human                 languages.                                                                                                                                                      Atomic elements of phonological theory are binary features, which               in sets characterize the nature of a sound segment.  Several                    decades of research have fairly well established the inventory of               such features in human languages around the globe.  The number of               features, however, is such as to permit many more combinations                  than there are actually possible sound segments in the world's                  languages.  Therefore in this respect phonological theory is                    inadequately constrained.                                                                                                                                       The aim of Dr. Archangeli's research is to explore the possible                 applicability of one fundamental constraint on feature                          combination which she has proposed, which she calls the                         \"Grounding Hypothesis\".  The GH rests on the fact that although                 the features are abstract entities, they arise from and denote                  certain physical factors about deformations of the oral cavity in               the process of speech.  The GH states that all possible formal                  conditions on feature combinations follow from the physical                     content of the factor which the feature denotes.  This is far                   from a self-evident proposition; in fact, it is controversial                   within the field.  Dr. Archangeli, however, has devised a                       research program to subject the GH to empirical tests across a                  wide range of phenomena.  Most immediately, the tests will                      involve studying the sound systems of a number of languages of                  Indonesia, which have interesting relevant phonological                         properties.  She will then expand the research to other                         languages, and to implications in such areas as language change                 and language acquisition.                                                                                                                                       Dr. Archangeli is a committed and successful teacher, who is                    achieving a strong reputation for the number and quality of                     graduate students studying with her.  This FAW award will enable                her to support some of these students and involve them directly                 in her research program.",
