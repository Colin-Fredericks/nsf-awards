 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action provides funding to coordinate and carry out all               phases of a planning effort for a conference to showcase the                    highly successful Industry/University Cooperative Research                      Centers (I/UCRC) Program established 20 years ago.  The                         conference will be for an audience of 300-500 people                            representing current industrial, state, and federal supporters of               the I/UCRCs; leaders of industrial organizations not now members                of any of the I/UCRCs; representatives of state agencies not now                supporting I/UCRCs in their states; members of Congress and their               staff; and appropriate representatives of the Executive Branch of               the federal government; presidents and vice presidents for                      research from academia; and representatives of the media. Major                 goals of the conference will be to provide to the industrial                    participants insights on the role such centers might play in                    supporting the goals of their industry; to inform Congress of the               activities of the I/UCRCs in promoting the nation's industrial                  growth; to demonstrate the progress made in conducting an                       extensive program of industrially relevant research; and to                     demonstrate how much of the past research has resulted in new                   products and processes.  A steering committee will oversee the                  planning of the conference and will work together to ensure that                the goals of the conference are met.                                                 The Program Manager recommends funding of this planning                    proposal in the amount of $79,568 for one year.",
