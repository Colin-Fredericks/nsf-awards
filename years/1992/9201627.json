 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study the problem of scheduling a complex               job shop system under dynamic arrivals.  This will include product              routings that may be reentrant flows.  Machines may incur sequence-             dependent setup times.  This is an important, but difficult problem             to solve.  The research will provide analytical models as well as               heuristics for the simpler versions of the multi-machine problem                and, in particular, the bottleneck machines.  These analytical                  models will be used to provide a decision support system for shop               flow scheduling.                                                                     The ultimate goal is to develop efficient  algorithms for the              more complicated and realistic problems by adopting the techniques              and properties developed for the simpler problem in a more                      sophisticated or \"smart and lucky\" search  algorithm.  This problem             is inspired by actual industrial problems and will closely                      collaborate with the personnel of a manufacturing job shop to test              the algorithms and systems in an industrial setting.",
