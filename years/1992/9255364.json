Curriculum refork efforts will yield an integrated                              curricular framework in mathematics and science which                           includes instructional resource support materials.                                                                                                              Teacher enhancement and staff development efforts will                          build upon the \"lead teacher\" concept already                                   established in the district's schools to create School                          Science and Mathematics Leadership Teams.  Within each                          of the district's five administrative areas, cluster or                         feeder schools will come together as School Partnership                         Teams, thereby constituting Kindergarten through grade                          12 field study laboratories.

The PMSA Advisory Board will review and                           advise staff regarding such issues as priority areas of                         focus; teacher, student and parent activities; outreach                         initiatives; and process and product evaluations for the                        efforts undertaken through the grant.
