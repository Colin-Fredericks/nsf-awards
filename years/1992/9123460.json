 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) has been concerned                  with the design of automated agents which can interact                          effectively in order to satisfy their goals.  This project will                 contribute to both the theory and design of efficient autonomous                agents which are able to communicate and negotiate in such a way                as to enhance the possibility of reaching mutually beneficial                   agreements.  The  authors are developing a strategic model of                   negotiation that takes the passage of time during the negotiation               process itself into consideration.  This model is used in the                   creation of a prototype of an autonomous agent that participates                in situations where negotiations are required, and where time                   constraints exist.  A preliminary model has been constructed,                   based on the differentialimpact of time on the parties, the                     effects of two-partyand restricted N-party environments, an full                information. The researchers are extending the model to deal with               situations where the information available to the agents is                     incomplete, to more complicated N-party situations, and to agents               with limited rationality.  Parallel to these theoretical                        extensions, the design of the automated negotiator is being                     developed and a prototype created.  The strategic model is used                 to identify efficient strategies for the automated negotiator,                  for various negotiationsituations.  A library of meta-strategies                in which the strategies will be presented using the                             finite-automata framework is being built.  The automated                        negotiator identifies the appropriate parameters of its                         situation, searches for the appropriate strategy, and negotiates                according to that strategy.                                                      //",
