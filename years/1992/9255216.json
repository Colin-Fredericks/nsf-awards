 "awd_abstract_narration": "Founded in 1979, the Science Skills Center (SSC) is a non-profit                community based program which encourages young minority and                     female students to pursue careers in science, mathematics, and                  technology.  At its current two sites in Brooklyn, N.Y., approximately          400 students, ages six to eighteen, are enrolled in programs where              they take accelerated courses in biology, chemistry, physical science,          rocketry, oceanography, botany, and mathematics.  This summer                   science camp expands two of the existing sites to include an                    additional total of one hundred and fifty African-American and Hispanic         middle school students.  At one site, the Summer Science Institute, a           group of students spend one week in each of six areas (i.e. chemistry,          biochemistry, biology, botany, computers,electronics and                        chess/mathematics).  Students also take weekly field trips to                   museums or engineering firms.  At another site, the Science Skills              Center and IBM have developed an engineering BASE (Building                     Access to Science Enrichment) program, a program whose goal is to               expose talented minority youth to careers in engineering.  Students get         to observe first-hand science principles at IBM's Brooklyn facility and         receive instruction from IBM engineers in several courses including             systems architecture, chemical and electrical engineering and                   computer science.",
