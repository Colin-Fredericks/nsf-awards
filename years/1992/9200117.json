In accordance with his/her interests,               each student will participate as a team member in one of the                    following four research groups:  1) design, construct and operate               a small-scale permeable barrier for groundwater aquifer                         remediation; 2) investigate fracture in rock and concrete using                 laser interferometry and conduct numerical simulations using an                 interactive graphical method; 3) construct small scale models of                hydraulic structures and test these models in an open channel flow              facility; and 4) assist in numerical simulations and experimental               observations of granular soil under shear using 2D elliptical                   disks.  The students will become familiar with their projects                   through early contact with the research faculty.  Each student can              expect to learn to work independently over the course of the                    summer, will present a final seminar on the research, and will                  assist in writing a publication describing the work.",
