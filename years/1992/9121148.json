 "awd_abstract_narration": "The human eye is never still; the eyes move even when a person                  gazes steadily at an object.  These involuntary movements of the                eye are minuscule, and have been extensively studied with respect               to their size, frequency and how they change according to the                   object being fixated.  A useful method for studying these eye                   movements is to render the retinal image steady in relation to                  the light receptors--the stabilized image technique.  After an                  initial  period of clear visibility, the image gradually fades                  and disappears, despite its constant presence on the retina.                    Understanding how and why retinally stabilized images disappear                 is important to clarifying how the visual system detects and                    adapts to steady and moving images.                                                                                                                             The present research involves development of a quantitative model               of stabilized-image adaptation, relating these adaptation                       processes to known theories of light adaptation.  Three areas of                research are involved:  The spatial aspects of the adaptation                   process are studied in detail; the response of the adaptation                   process to uniform lights is measured; and the use of colored                   stimuli should help determine the physiological location of the                 adaptation process, itself.  The development of a general model                 from this research will provide a framework within which the                    effect of adaptation to any spatio-temporal signal can be                       assessed, including those generated by normal motions of the eye.",
