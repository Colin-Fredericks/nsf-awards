 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project combines geochronologic, paleomagnetic and                    geochemical studies of this Potrillo Volcanic Field of southern New             Mexico.  This young (<Ma) field is located within the active Rio                Grande Rift and is composed of a series of maare and several                    hundred mafic flows.  Geochronologic methods will include 40AR/39Ar,            U-series disequilibria, and surface exposure (3He) dating.  The age             limits of these three methods overlap, thus allowing an excellent               opportunity to develop a robust chronology for the field while also             testing the internal consistency of each method.  The series of                 flows preserve a large population of high fidelity records of the               geomagnetic field.   An intensive paleomagnetic sampling regime,                in conjunction with the chronologic studies, will be used to                    identify and date high amplitude geomagnetic excursions of the                  Earth's magnetic field and to examine to axial dipole hypothesis,               a tenet of paleomagnetism which assumes that the geomagnetic field              averages to a geocentric axial dipole over time.  These studies,                combined with trace element and petrological characterization of                the flows, will provide insight into the rates of physical and                  chemical evolution and the eruptive cyclicity within is very young              field and serve as a paradigm for currently active explosive                    volcanism contributing atmospheric aerosols on a global basis.",
