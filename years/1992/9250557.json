Microprocessor-based controllers and models of                   ship equipment are controlled by feed-forward neural network                    algorithms in the newly funded laboratory.  Novel features of                   this project are the adoption of optimal (Nlsp type) neural                     networks (i.e., networks which require the smallest number of                   arithmetic operations to propagate from input to output), and                   learning algorithms which guarantee convergence to an optimal                   solution.  The equipment is used in ship design projects at all                 stages of the Integrated Learning System Program of the Marine                  Engineering Department, emphasizing intelligent control and                     automation.",
