 "awd_abstract_narration": "A pivotal issue in developmental neuroscience pertains to the                   mechanisms regulating the choice of the correct target by a nerve               cell.  This issue will be addressed by examining the embryonic                  assembly of a functional neural circuit in the medicinal leech,                 Hirudo medicinalis.  The stereotyped adult circuitry of the leech               heart excitor motor neurons that drive precisely coordinated                    rhythmic contractions of the heart tubes is particularly well                   understood.  However, this stereotyped circuitry arises as result               of initial axonal projections to several target regions followed by             a retraction of the incorrectly positioned axons.  The processes of             initial outgrowth and later retraction of these axons will be                   investigated using light, laser and electron microscopic                        visualization, as well as intracellular electrophysiology.                      Parallel experiments will determine the developmental time course               of functional synaptic connectivity between central interneurons                that ultimately drive the coordinated behavior and the heart                    excitor neurons.  The simplicity of this system will allow                      exploration across several levels of analysis, from morphology to               behavior, of the developmental interactions that occur during the               assembly of a simple, but behaviorally relevant neural circuit.  It             is expected that an understanding of the principles that underlie               the development of specificity in this system will pertain to more              complex systems, since the developmental strategy of initial axonal             exuberant growth followed by retraction is commonly used by                     embryonic neurons in higher species as well.",
