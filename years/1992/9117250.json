 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six unusual coenzymes (methanofuran, tetrahydromethanopterin,                   coenzyme M. nickle tetrapyrrole F430, deazaflavin F420, and 7-                  mercaptoheptanolythreonine phosphate) so far have been discovered               to be required for the reduction of carbon dioxide the methane.                 The present project continue studies on the terminal reactions of               this process, methyl group transfer and reduction to methane.  The              protein known as component C is now clearly established as the                  methylreductase (MR).  Special interests are:  How does the cell                maintain MR in the active state?                                                %%%                                                                             Methanogenic bacteria (methanogens) are archaebacteria and                      represent an ancient divergence in evolution.  An interesting                   aspect of this divergence is that the biochemistry of                           methanogenesis has remained isolated in the methanogens, a                      characteristic not shared by other living things.  The                          uniqueness of this biochemistry is dramatically shown by the                    six unusual coenzymes that so far have been discovered to be                    required for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane. These                  studies are original and significant.",
