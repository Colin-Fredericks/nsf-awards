 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to assess the evolution and the                 performance of the labor market in the U.S. and abroad.  The                    research will consist of four separate, but related projects.                   The first will analyze the determinants of regional fluctuations                in wages, earnings, and employment.  This project is built around               an empirical model of labor demand that can isolate the effects                 of product demand shifts and technical change on labor market                   outcomes.  This is of interest for its application to local labor               markets, and for its implications for changes in aggregate wages                and employment.  Second, a set of international comparisons will                be developed regarding the evolution of labor markets, focusing                 on countries that provide important contrasts to the U.S.                       experience.  A key goal is to compare the evolution of labor                    markets in Korea and Taiwan where productivity and wages tripled                in less than 15 years to the more developed countries of the U.S.               and Sweden that experienced sluggish growth in productivity and                 wages.  Third, the relationships between changes in wages, labor                supply, and unemployment will be determined and analyzed.                       Finally, work will be initiated on a modern, quantitative history               of labor markets in the U.S.  Among other topics this project                   will include work on changes in the structure of wages, the                     evolution of unemployment and labor force participation, changes                in labor markets, and effects of immigration.",
