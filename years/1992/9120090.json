 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is an investigation of calmodulin in Paramecium.               It will extend the previous observation that a point mutation in                calmodulin causes the Paramecium to swim backward. Calmodulin is                involved in calcium-regulated potassium channels and cell viability             in this organism. Other mutant calmodulins will be prepared and                 their sensitivity to barium ions will be examined; the mutant cam1              has been shown to have increased sensitivity to barium, which can               replace calcium in its four binding sites. Intergenic suppressors               of the calmodulin mutants cam1 and cam 11 will be sought, to try                to find other genes involved in the regulation of ion channels and              cell viability. Intragenic and intergenic suppressors which affect              activation of the calcium-dependent potassium channel                           differentially from the barium sensitivity will be sought. Proteins             which bind wild-type Paramecium calmodulin better than its mutant               calmodulins will be searched for in mammalian cells, and the genes              coding for these proteins will be isolated.                                                                                                                     Calmodulin is a protein which is present in all cell types which                have been examined. It binds calcium and is involved in regulation              of many aspects of cellular function.  Among these are the                      regulation of channels which permit entry of ions into cells and                regulation of the cell cycle. In the protozoan Paramecium, a                    mutation in a single amino acid has been shown to cause the                     organism to swim backward. In addition, this mutation increases the             sensitivity of the organism to barium, which can substitute for                 calcium at specific binding sites. The proposal involves a search               for additional calmodulin mutants by a variety of techniques, a                 search for intergenic suppressors of the proteins, and a search for             proteins in mammalian cells which bind differently to wild-type and             mutant calmodulins from the protozoan. Proteins which do not affect             the activation of the calcium-dependent potassium channel but do                affect the ability of calmodulin to bind barium will also be                    sought. The study should increase understanding of how calmodulin               regulates cell processes.",
