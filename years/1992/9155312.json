 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ms. Phyllis Brady is the Director of the Child Development                      Programs in the Education Office of Santa Barbara County,                       California.  Ms. Brady proposes three years of leadership                       training in science and math education for 90 elementary and                    pre-school teachers from Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San                        Luis Obispo Counties.  The teachers would be drawn from                         schools with large minority enrollments, and the training                       would focus on modifying existing instructional materials,                      and developing new materials, that address the                                  multicultural, socioeconomic, physical disability, and                          gender equity issues.                                                                                                                                           The proposed workshops will provide the participating                           teachers with an excellent background and experience in                         science and math content, and the most current teaching                         methods in early childhood science/math education.  This                        training experience will allow them to develop strategies                       for improving equity of access to science and mathematics                       for children of diverse backgrounds.  They will then train                      and work with the other teachers in their respective schools                    to extend the impact of their training.                                                                                                                         The cost sharing for this project (not including substitute                     release days for participating teachers provided by their                       school districts) represents 17% of the NSF contribution.",
