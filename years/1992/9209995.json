From a processing perspective, persuasion                can be modelled as an information processing sequence that                      culminates in an attitude judgment.  That judgment is determined                by subprocesses that encode, elaborate on, and integrate some                   subset of the attitude-relevant information available.  From the                processing approach, affective states have cognitive and                        motivational consequences that influence the extent and valence                 of encoding, elaboration; and integration, and thus of                          persuasion.  Past research in this domain is extended in three                  directions:  (a) the impact of affective states on reception and                integration processes as well as on elaboration is investigated,                (b) specific tests of the role of cognitive and motivational                    variables as mediators of the relationship between affective                    states, persuasion subprocesses, and persuasion are performed and               (c) the processing perspective is extended to the investigation                 of the impact of negative (sad) affect.  The first set of                       proposed experiments assesses the impact of affect on the nature                and extent of reception, and its concomitant effect on attitude                 change.  Experiments in Set 2 examine the motivational and                      cognitive mechanisms through which affect influences elaboration                and thus persuasion.  The experiments in Set 3 begin to explore                 the impact of affective states on integration processes in                      attitudinal judgments.  This research will add to our                           understanding of the impact of affect on persuasion.",
