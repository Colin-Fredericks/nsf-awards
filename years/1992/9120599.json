 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diverse manifestations of violent activity in the nuclei of                     galaxies are believed to result from the interactions of matter                 with a supermassive black hole.  However, the details of these                  interactions and their observational signatures are not well                    understood.  This award will support theoretical research studying              three important classes of phenomena in active galactic nuclei                  (AGNs):  the formation of relativistic jets, the production of                  X-ray spectra, and interactions involving ultrarelativistic                     particles.  The investigations described in this proposal will                  address the questions:                                                                                                                                          Why do some AGNs produce powerful jets while others do not?                                                                                                     What can X-ray observations tell us about the temperatures,                     densities, and spatial organization of matter close to the black                hole?                                                                                                                                                           What roles (if any) do ultrarelativistic particles play in shaping              the energy output of an AGN, and how does this energy affect the                environment of the AGN?                                                                                                                                         The long-term goals of this research are: 1) to determine whether               the interactions of matter with a supermassive black hole really                are responsible for AGN phenomena; 2) to understand in detail how               these interactions take place: and 3) to learn what effects nuclear             activity can have on the appearance and evolution of the host                   galaxy.",
