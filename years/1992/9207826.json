 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most flowering plants function as both male and females, through                the production of either pollen or seeds.  Theory suggests that                 female reproductive success is usually limited by resources                     available for seed production.  The male function in plants is                  limited by the ability of the plant to disperse pollen.  This leads             to the prediction that the attractiveness of flowers to pollinators             has relatively limited effect on the production of seed, but a                  large effect on the dispersal of pollen, and hence the fitness of               the plant as a male.  Despite this predicted importance of male                 fitness to the evolution of floral attraction, the distribution of              paternal reproductive success in natural populations has been                   exceedingly difficult to measure.  DNA \"fingerprinting\" can be used             to determine paternity unambiguously in plant populations, and                  therefore to estimate paternal reproductive success.  Methods will              be developed to measure paternal and maternal fitness in the                    prairie plant Heliopsis helianthoides in a collaborative study that             has both intensive field and laboratory components.  The three                  objectives are:  1) to document variation among H. helianthoides                for hypervariable loci; 2) to determine the mode of inheritance for             these loci; 3) to use seedlings of known percentage to determine if             the hypervariable loci can be used to assign paternity in a wild                population of H. helianthoides.  This work will contribute the                  basic data necessary to apply the technique of DNA \"fingerprinting\"             to the evaluation of current hypotheses on the evolution of floral              structures.",
