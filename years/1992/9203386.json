 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Arthur Demarest, Mr. Takeshi Inomata                 will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct                archaeological excavations at the Mayan site of Aguateca which is               located in the El Peten department of Guatemala. This large Classic             period Mayan site contains a complex of stone structures as well as             what appears to be a defensive wall. Building on prior work he has              done at the site, Mr.Inomata will excavate residences and walls. He             will clear rooms in elite structures and excavate test pits in                  other areas of the site. The focus of the field research will be on             the function of walls as well as the dates of wall construction. He             will attempt to determine just when the site was abandoned. The                 goal of the project is to determine the role played by warfare in               the development and subsequent collapse of Mayan society. The data              collected by Mr. Inomata will hopefully allow him to determine                  whether the stone walls played a defensive purpose. It will also                permit him to learn how social organization at the site changed                 over time and whether occupation was abruptly terminated.                                                                                                       Mayan peoples developed a complex centralized society in the                    inhospitable tropical lowlands of Middle America. They built                    temples and other ceremonial structures, developed appropriate                  agricultural technologies and created societal structures which                 incorporated tens of thousands of individuals into single political             units. During the late first millennium A.D. however these entities             disappeared - a phenomenon referred to as the \"Mayan Collapse.\" The             cause for this is still uncertain. While some researchers argue                 that ecological change played a major role, others point to the                 possible effect of warfare. Much recent interest has focussed on                the El Peten region of Guatemala where defensive walls suggest                  large scale conflict. Mr. Inomata's work will provide valuable data             relevant to this question.                                                                                                                                      This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our                   understanding of adaptation to tropical regions and will assist in              the training of a promising scientist.",
