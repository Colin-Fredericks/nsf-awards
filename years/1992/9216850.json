 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key step in the manufacture of printed wire assemblies                        (PWAs) is the removal of flux residues from the PWA surfaces.                   This cleaning ensures the electrical performance of the PWA                     and adhesion of post-assembly coatings, facilitates testing                     and inspections of the assembly, and preserves the mechanical                   properties of the substrate.  This cleaning is usually done                     using blends of chlorinated fluorocarbons, primarily CFC-113,                   and light alcohols, such as methanol.  With the advent of the                   Montreal Protocol, the use of CFC-113 for mictroelectronics                     cleaning is being phased out.                                                                                                                                   A possible cleaning alternative utilizes solutions of nonionic                  surfactants in the lamellar liquid crystal phase conformation                   near their phase inversion temperatures.  These solutions                       exhibit ultralow interfacial tension against polar, nonpolar,                   and mixed contaminants (flux residue may be considered a mix                    of polar and nonpolar contaminants).  This low interfacial                      tension allows rapid, spontaneous emulsification of the                         contaminants to occur when the surfactant and contaminant come                  in contact.  The surfactant solutions exhibit low interfacial                   tensions against polar and nonpolar materials, hence their                      contact angle on PWA substrates will be very low, allowing                      rapid penetration beneath components.  The surfactant                           solutions offer high solubilization capacity for flux                           residues, so that many boards can be cleaned without requiring                  regeneration of the cleaning solvent.                                                                                                                           This research includes both experimental and theoretical work                   to investigate the use of lamellar and micellar solutions of                    nonionic surfactants as replacements for CFC-113 based                          cleaners of PWAs.  The work will focus on the development of                    both the theory of contaminant removal from PWA surfaces and                    the relationship between the microstructure of surfactant                       solutions and the parameters which control contaminant                          removal.  The structure and composition of the surfactants,                     contaminant, and substrate, as well as the effects of chemical                  additives in the cleaning solution, will be related to the                      cleaning effectiveness.  Lamellar and micellar surfactant                       solutions will be studied and the effects of solution                           additives on the fromation of these phases and their cleaning                   power will be evaluated.  The controlling step in the removal                   of contaminants from PWA surfaces will also be investigated.",
