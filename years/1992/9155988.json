 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical science majors at UCLA have deceased monotonically for                 20 years. The UCLA Science Challenge has accepted as its                        mission four goals: 1) retain current science majors, 2)                        recruit new science majors, 3) attract minority students to                     science, and 4) improve student attitudes toward science. UCLA                  serves an unusually diverse student body chosen from the top                    12.5% of California high school graduates. Every student enters                 qualified to major in science. The six departments that                         comprise the UCLA Science Challenge, Astronomy, Atmospheric                     Science, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Earth and Space Science,                   Mathematics, and Physics, taught approximately 6000                             undergraduate students in lower-division courses last year.                     More than 20% of these students are Black or Hispanic. We have                  the student contact; we have an awesome opportunity. We have                    focused on lower-division courses and laboratories, and we have                 experimented with methods. We find that interactive, computer-                  based materials provide the most effective and the most popular                 laboratory instruction. Interactive seminars and discussion                     sessions, which have students at a computer terminal, have                      proved exceptionally effective in teaching. Computationally                     intensive demonstration programs created at UCLA have generated                 excitement in lectures. We are now converting these                             demonstration programs to interactive student programs. Using                   these experiences, we developed and implemented three new                       prototype courses in Astronomy, Atmospheric Science, and                        Chemistry using interactive program modules. Student response                   exceeded our wildest hopes. Cognitive Psychology evaluates our                  teaching effectiveness and assesses student attitudes. We now                   are now radically overhauling our lower-division science based                  on the creation of 11 new courses and 18 new interdisciplinary                  laboratory modules.",
