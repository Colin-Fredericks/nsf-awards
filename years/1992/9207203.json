 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases                    continue to rise.  This phenomenon may lead to increases in the                 mean global temperature as well as in yearly, and even daily,                   variations in temperature.  One consequence of increasing variation             in temperatures if that plants may be exposed to sudden and severe              increases in temperature (i.e, heat shocks) at a greater frequency              than they are now.  The ability of plants to withstand these                    hyperthermic episodes is most likely related, at least in part, to              their capacity for elevating levels of certain heat shock proteins              (hsps).  A great deal of information regarding the molecular                    biology of these proteins in plants exist.  Yet, little is known                how the physiological state of the cell or whole-plant prior to the             imposition of heat stress affect the synthesis and accumulation of              hsps or the ability of plants to survive heat stress.  This void in             understanding is particularly critical because plants in natural                environmental of plants may not only be characterized by changes in             temperature patterns, but will almost certainly contain extremely               high levels of air pollutants (e.g., CO2, ozone) and changing                   nutrient contents in precipitation and soils.  Thus, understanding              the role that plant physiological status may play in governing the              heat shock response may provide new essential data on the roles of              heat shock proteins in the acquisition and maintenance of                       thermotolerance in plant tissues.  The overall goal of this                     research is to assess the relationship between the synthesis and                accumulation of heat shock proteins at the cellular level and the               overall stress responses of whole-plants and tissues grown under                distinctly different physiological environments.  Specific                      genotypes of corn (Zea mays) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum)               will be grown in environments with different availabilities of                  carbon (CO2) and nitrogen resulting in plants at different                      physiological states.  These plants will then be exposed to heat                stress or to control conditions.  The kinetics of heat shock                    protein synthesis and the patterns of recovery of normal protein                synthesis (molecular level); the capacity of plants to harvest                  light and CO2 for photosynthesis (tissue level); and overall plant              performance (whole-plant level), will be examined simultaneously.               The results should help to clarify the biological role of hsps by               linking molecular phenomena to processes occurring at tissue and                whole-plant levels.  Furthermore, how plants in both agricultural               and natural systems will respond to the  predicted changes in the               global climate is a critical question, and understanding how the                stress response of plants might be altered in a high CO2                        environment would be an important step in solving that problem.",
