 "awd_abstract_narration": "The governing position of microorganisms in biogeochemical                 cycles has long been appreciated, yet the ecology of the                        contributing natural microbial populations remains poorly                       resolved.                                                                       This is principally a consequence of the technical and historical                                                                                               limitations of pure culture isolation and phenotypic                            classification.  However, the advent of molecular systematics and                                                                                               newer techniques of molecular biology and recombinant DNA have                  markedly changed the repertoire of tools available to the                       microbial                                                                       ecologist.  It is now feasible to define microbial communities at                                                                                               the level of populations and even single cells.  The proposed                   research will use and, to a more limited extent, develop                        phylogenetically-based molecular techniques to study the                        population                                                                      structure of complex anaerobic communities.  These studies will                 emphasize the characterization of methanogenic and sulfate-                     reducing bacterial populations.                                                      Sulfate-reducing and mentanogenic bacteria comprise                        anaerobic                                                                       populations which perform the terminal mineralization of organic                                                                                                matter within the microbial communities of aquatic sediments and                                                                                                other anaerobic settings.  They are generally considered to be in                                                                                               competition for substrates, the outcome of which is dependent                   upon                                                                            the availability of sulfate as the electron acceptor.                           Comparative                                                                     16s rRNA sequencing will provide the framework for developing and                                                                                               applying analytical molecular techniques to determine the                       population structure of each functional group in different                      communities.  The molecular techniques will include:  1)                        Selective                                                                       PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rRNA genes, and                                                                                                2) Phylongentically-based hybridization probes.
