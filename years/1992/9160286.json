 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quality x-ray optics will be a key factor in the success of                x-ray imaging applications such as lithography, x-ray                           lasers, x-ray microscopes, and x-ray spectroscopy.  Multi-                      layer lamellar gratings and phase patterned x-ray optics would                  offer advantages in spectral resolution, spatial resolution, and                power efficiency over current x-ray optics used in these                        applications.  The production of reflective phase structures will               require innovative schemes for fabrication.   This                              research will develop a fabrication process suitable for phase                  structures based on processes used in the semiconductor                         industry.  The method utilized will be suitable for the                         fabrication of phase gratings with periods of less than .2\u001am or                 the limits of lithographic resolution.  The feasibility of this                 method will be shown by making large scale (5 square cm.)                       multilayer phase gratings of .3\u001am to .8\u001am periodicity, which will               be characterized on the Brookhaven synchrotron.  The                            experiments will determine the feasibility of making gratings of                less than .2\u001am periodicity.  The processes developed under this                 proposal will be directly applicable to fabricating other phase                 structures such as zone plate x-ray lenses.",
