 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flavoenzymes catalyze a wide variety of metabolically                           significant reactions.  Flavoprotein oxidases are among the                     simplest of these enzymes, catalyzing the transfer of a hydride                 equivalent from their substrates to molecular oxygen to form                    hydrogen peroxide.  The research proposed here will develop                     methods utilizing kinetic isotope effects on steady state and                   rapid reaction kinetics to examine the mechanisms of                            flavoprotein oxidases, using D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) as a                   model.  The PI will determine the pH dependence of the V/K                      values and of the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on                  the V/K values with D-alanine, D-serine, and glycine; determine                 if the maximal observed isotope effects are the intrinsic                       values; measure secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects in                  order to determine if carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage and flavin                  reduction in D-amino acid oxidase are stepwise or concerted;                    and replace the native FAD with artificial flavins with                         different redox potentials and determine the intrinsic isotope                  effects.  These methods will then be used to evaluate the                       results of site-directed mutagenesis of individual amino acid                   residues in DAAO.  They will also be applied to two additional                  flavoprotein oxidases, tryptophan monooxygenase and alcohol                     oxidase, to ascertain their general applicability.                              %%%                                                                             Flavoproteins are a major class of proteins involved in a wide                  variety of metabolic processes.  Elucidation of the catalytic                   mechanisms of these enzymes can provide insights into the                       mechanisms of a number of metabolically significant enzymes, into               the mechanisms of more complex flavoproteins, and into general                  biological mechanisms of electron transfer and oxygen activation.               This research will yield information pertaining to the mechanism of             flavoprotein oxidases using kinetic isotope effects to examine the              role of specific amino acid residues in catalysis.  General                     knowledge about flavoprotein carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage as well              as about oxygen activation by flavin and pterin dependent enzymes               will also be generated.",
