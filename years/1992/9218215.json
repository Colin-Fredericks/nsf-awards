 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards supports the research of Professor A. Bertram to               work in algebraic geometry.  He will study the moduli spaces of                 vector bundles on an algebraic curve. In particular he hopes to                 derive a rigorous proof of the empirically observed formula of                  Verlinde and Witten for studying the cohomology groups associated               to these moduli spaces.                                                              The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                 the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                 to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems                that have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures                   defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                       polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra,               but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is                       extensively used in those fields.  Moreover it has proved itself                useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer                    science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.",
