 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses an important problem in                                 system and control area: the analysis and design of                             control systems in the face of uncertainty.  The                                problem of designing a control system against                                   uncertainties is of fundamental practical interest                              and has been the main thrust for development of                                 control theory and technology.  The proposed                                    research on this subject includes stability analysis,                           stabilization, and disturbance rejection in the                                 presence of real, possible nonlinear/time varying,                              uncertainties.  Each of these problems is of                                    independent interest and they together follow a                                 natural progression toward the development of a                                 general methodology for analysis and design of                                  uncertain systems.  The main object under here will                             be an uncertain dynamical system described by a                                 linear fractional transformation, and the necessary                             tools required for this research include advanced                               matrix theory, convex optimization techniques, and                              modern robust control theory.  The approaches and                               idea proposed here are believed to be unique and                                original.  In particular, the proposed approaches for                           the stabilization of systems with structured                                    nonlinear/time varying uncertainty using the                                    combination of convex optimization and advanced                                 separation principle, and using the parameter                                   dependent gain scheduled controller, appear very                                promising, and are expected to lead to valuable                                 applications in practical design of highly complex                              uncertain systems.",
