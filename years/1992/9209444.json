 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the general problem of solving                     the non-linear equations arising from semiconductor device                      simulation and circuit simulation.  Both sequential and                         parallel issues arising in the solution of these equations                      will be examined.                                                                    Work has already been done on the solution of the                          linear equation arising from the Newton iteration in a one-                     dimensional device simulation.  Work will continue for a                        two-dimensional code.  The main ideas are (1) replacing the                     continuation methods currently in use with a multilevel                         method; and (2) developing a parallel solver for the 2D                         code.  This entails either showing that the classical                           iterative method has speed-up large enough to overcome the                      sequential slowness of the algorithm, or generating a good                      MIMD preconditioner for a Krylov subspace method.                                    With respect to circuit simulation, the investigation                      will be done in four areas.  (1) Continue the work on a                         taxonomy of circuits for which simulation cannot fail.  (2)                     Improve the non-linear solver in the circuit simulator CAzM.                    (3) Generate a parallel solver for large circuits.  (4) Work                    on blocking methods for sparsely connected circuits.                                 The project seeks to make a significant contribution to                    both the speed and the theory behind the solution of non-                       linear equations arising from circuit and device simulation.",
