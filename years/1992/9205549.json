 "awd_abstract_narration": "Closed basin coastal landforms and sediments provide                       excellent opportunities to study past environments and processes.               This is often essential for more realistic regional-scale                       modelling of paleoclimates.  The Great Basin of the western                     United States comprises numerous closed basins separated by                     towering mountain ranges.  At present, most of the basins are dry               or contain only shallow ephemeral lakes.  During the late                       Pleistocene, deep lakes occupied many of these basins, and they                 left abundant geomorphic  and stratigraphic evidence.  The                      subsequent arid environment of the Great Basin left well-                       preserved evidence unobscured by vegetation.  This paleolake                    evidence can provide excellent clues to the temporal and spatial                variability of coastal processes and landforms, lacustrine                      chronologies, and hydro-isostatic deflection of the basins.  This               project will study one such basin in Nevada.  It will be the                    first detailed analysis of lacustrine landforms and vectors of                  sediment erosion, transportation, and deposition, and it will                   reconstruct the lacustrine chronology for comparison with                       chronologies from Lake Bonneville.  Spatial aspects of the study                will rely upon topographic map, aerial photograph, and remotely                 sensed imagery interpretation in addition to field study and                    geographic information system analysis.  The temporal framework                 will be tested with radio carbon dating and amino acid analysis.                These methods should enable reconstruction of basin and shoreline               characteristics to fill out the chronological record.                                This research will fill in an important chapter in the                     paleoclimate record of the intermediate region between Lake                     Bonneville and Lake Lahontan.  Research on such arid, closed-                   basin environments is not extensive; thus this project will                     support paleoclimatic modelling of the Great Basin, enhance                     ongoing archaeological studies in the Basin, and further                        elucidate the far field effects of Lake Bonneville's hydro-                     isostatic deflection.",
