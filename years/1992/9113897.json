 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Richard M. Noyes is supported by a grant from the                     Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                 studies of oscillations and dynamic instabilities in chemical                   systems.  In particular, Noyes proposes to perform studies in                   the following basic areas: 1) to further the mechanistic                        studies of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction; 2) to improve our                 understanding of the oscillatory oxidation of benzaldehyde; 3)                  to study the nucleation of bubbles and transport of molecules                   between gas and liquid phases; 4) to extend the theories of                     behavior in complex systems; and 5) to study oscillations and                   instabilities in biological systems.                                            %%%                                                                             Any chemical system isolated from further inputs of matter or                   energy will ultimately decay toward a nonreactive state called                  chemical equilibrium.  If light or heat or reactant chemicals                   of high energy are constantly added, the system may be kept far                 from equilibrium and may exhibit exotic behaviors such as                       oscillations in composition or bursts of gas evolution.  Noyes'                 research program is directed to discovering and elucidating                     these mechanisms and to learning the conditions responsible for                 their occurence.  Such studies are intended to learn both how                   to prevent undesirable instabilitiers and also how to use                       instabilities to accomplish useful purposes.",
