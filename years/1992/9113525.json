 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award allow the establishment of a regional archival                  center for early life history stages of fishes (eggs and larvae)                of the Pacific Northwest at the University of Washington.  The                  project will consolidate and curate 7 individual collections now                at UW (1 at School of Fisheries; 2 at School of Oceanography; 1                 at Int. Pac. Halibut Comm.) and a t government agencies (3 at                   Alaska Fisheries Science Center) in the Seattle area.  The                      consolidated collection -- 48,000 lots -- will be the third                     largest fish egg and larval holdings in the U.S.  The collection                transfers have the written approval and recommendation of the                   USNM, the National Marine Fisheries Service of NOAA and the IPHC.               The USNM is not in position to accommodate these collections;                   but, as required by law, a representative collection of the                     holdings at the National Marine Fisheries Service will be made                  available to the USNM.  Each of the separate collections will now               receive far better curatorial care and more research use in the                 archival center.  The increased availability of a reorganized,                  integrated collection will help fill the demand for larval fish                 specimens for research and education in ecology, systematics,                   embryology and morphology and will also promote ontogenetic                     studies.",
