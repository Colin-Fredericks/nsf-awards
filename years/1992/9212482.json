 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dissolution of glassy polymers can be considered as a                           combination of solvent penetration featuring Case II transport                  and polymer dissolution controlled by polymer disentanglement.                  In the present work, an anomalous transport model is developed                  for solvent penetration and is coupled with a disentanglement                   model for polymer dissolution.  Solvent penetration is                          controlled by the relaxation or deformation of polymer and the                  diffusional Deborah number is shown to be a major model                         parameter.  In the disentanglement model, dissolution of                        polymer molecules requires that solvent concentration be                        greater than a critical gel concentration and that a polymer                    molecule be allowed a certain time to complete the                              disentanglement of diffusion movement from the gel state to                     liquid state.  This time is assumed to be equivalent to the                     reputation time, which is a function of molecular weight,                       solvent concentration and chain rigidity.  A concept of                         disentanglement clock is introduced as the material time clock                  controlling the dissolution.  The new model may explain many                    experimental observations, such as effects of type of solvent                   and polymer on dissolution rate and the thickness of the gel                    layer.  Experimental studies are performed with well-                           characterized samples of polystyrene and poly(methyl                            methacrylate) in various solvents using interferometry and                      critical angle illumination microscopy.  The solvent                            concentration profiles and dissolution rates are measured                       using ellipsometry.  The necessary self-diffusion coefficient                   of the polymer is measured by pulsed gradient spin echo NMR                     spectroscopy.  In addition, experimental studies are performed                  using poly(acrylic acid) and poly(vinyl alcohol) in water to                    study the influence of ionic conditions on dissolution.",
