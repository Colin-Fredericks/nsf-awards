 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a long-term visit by Professor Per                      Peterson, Department of Nuclear Engineering, University of                      California, Berkeley to Japan for a cooperative research project                with Professor Kunio Hijikata, Department of Mechanical                         Engineering Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology.  The                       researchers plan to undertake a study of instability and                        bifurcation in vertical condensing systems.  The study will focus               on instabilities which occur when lower molecular weight vapor                  condenses beneath higher molecular weight noncondensable gas, and               also on the inverse condition of high molecular weight vapor                    above low molecular weight noncondensable gas.  The research is                 of fundamental importance because as higher Rayleigh numbers are                encountered in industrial applications, no experimental,                        numerical or theoretical information is available even though the               unstable gas vapor interface is known to cause large temperature                and pressure fluctuations in condensing systems.                                                                                                                The research should result in significant advances in our                       understanding of heat transfer mechanisms in the heat pipe or                   other high efficiency thermal energy transport systems.                         Additional areas that will be impacted by this research include                 electronics, cooling, satellite thermal control, and surface                    condenser efficiency.  The Department of Mechanical Engineering                 Sciences at Tokyo Institute of Technology has excellent                         facilities for laser holographic and shadow-graph investigations                of condensation.  Professor Hijikata has extensive research                     experience in condensation problems and in numerical                            investigation of condensation in stable systems with                            noncondensable gases.  This complements Professor Peterson's work               in stable systems which should insure a fruitful collaboration                  resulting in benefits to both countries.  It is expected that                   this collaboration will continue after the formal agreement has                 terminated.",
