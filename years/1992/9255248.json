 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Raymond Barnhardt is a professor of                                 Anthropology and Educational Administration at the                              University of Alaska, Fairbanks. Dr. Barnhardt has organized                    a three-day conference on science education for Alaskan                         Native peoples. This conference will bring together science                     educators, scientists, and representatives of Alaskan Native                    organizations, especially the Alaska Federation of Natives.                     The conference participants will formulate a long-term                          agenda for improving science instruction for native                             children. One special focus of the conference will be the                       integration of Native tradition with the practice of western                    scientific traditions, in the setting of small rural fishing                    villages. This conference will produce a report outlining an                    agenda and priorities for future action.                                                Alaskan Native people have been underrepresented in                     the scientific and engineering disciplines. Science                             education programs for native children have been designed by                    non-natives, commonly resulting in a failure to integrate                       native traditions and culture with instructional content and                    delivery. The proposed conference will be the first meeting                     that brings together representatives of the Alaskan Native                      people and representatives of the non-native scientific and                     educational communities. The action plan and agenda produced                    by this conference will have the potential to catalyze                          significant improvements in science education.",
