 "awd_abstract_narration": "In their investigation of boundary layer heat transfer in the                   presence of very high free-stream turbulence, Maciejewski and                   Moffat (1990) conclude that the RMS value of the streamwise                     turbulent fluctuations, u', plays a dominant role in                            determining the heat transfer coefficient, h.  However, for                     the set of experiments that they performed, the value of u'                     was highly correlated with the value of the RMS turbulent                       fluctuations normal to their heat transfer surface, v'.  The                    primary goal of the proposed research is to establish a set of                  boundary layer flows in the presence of high free-stream                        turbulence for which v' may be varied independently of u' in                    order to test by means of experiments the hypothesis that v'                    and not u' determines h.  This same hypothesis will also be                     tested by measuring the individual components of the turbulent                  fluctuations instantaneously, using the hot-wire techniques                     suggested by Blair and Bennett (1987), and attempting to                        correlated them with the instantaneous surface heat flux,                       which will be measured using a technique described by Mancuso                   and Diller (1991).  Measurements of the turbulent heat flux                     and the turbulent shear stress will also be made for each of                    the free-stream test conditions in order to test the                            hypothesis that v' is independent of u'v' for boundary layer                    flows in the presence of high free-stream turbulence.",
