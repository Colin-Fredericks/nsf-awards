 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study why some urban neighborhoods                   become overwhelmingly poor and black.  The study will use census                tract data to describe changes in neighborhoods between 1970 and                1980.  In attempting to explain such changes, the investigators                 will consider first Wilson's so called mismatch hypothesis, which               sees economic restructuring as the basic reason for the                         concentration of poverty in urban areas.  An alternative                        explanation is provided by the out-migration hypothesis which                   sees the outmigration of the black middle class from the inner                  city ghetto as the primary reason for the changing composition of               many urban neighborhoods.  The resulting geographic concentration               of low-skilled, lower class families and individuals then gives                 rise to emergent properties of neighborhoods that may exacerbate                social problems, such as deteriorated housing, social isolation,                joblessness, and female-headed families.                                             The study will employ a unique data set constructed by the                 Urban Institute.  Census tract data from 1970 and 1980 are                      matched with geographical coordinates and additional SMSA-level                 characteristics.  The investigators will add further information                about metropolitan areas as well as longitude and latitude                      coordinates for each tract.  The resulting data file will be a                  national multi-level data base with information on all census                   tracts, their geographic position, and the characteristics of the               metropolitan area in which they are located.  The analysis of                   neighborhood change will be done using first difference equation                models with variables specified at two levels, the tract level                  and the metropolitan area level.                                                     This study will shed new light on the problem of                           concentrated urban poverty in the United States.  The study will                go a long way towards resolving the arguments both among social                 scientists and among policy makers about the causes of the                      spatial concentration of poverty that was observed during the                   1970s.",
