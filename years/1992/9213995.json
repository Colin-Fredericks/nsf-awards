 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to answer the following questions concerning the             processes that underlie the ability of human beings to learn new                skills:  What changes with learning?  What is the nature of change?             What factors determine the form taken by changes due to learning?               What governs the rate of learning?  Aside from the obvious                      practical advantages that will accrue to areas such as education                and training, answers to these questions will yield a deeper                    understanding of learning which is a fundamental feature of                     complex, living things.  While it is generally agreed that                      individuals are not tabulae rasae but instead bring different                   backgrounds and capacities into the learning environment,                       satisfactory concepts and methods to treat such individual                      differences in learning do not exist.  This research will introduce             new methods to evaluate spontaneous coordination tendencies on an               individual basis and will study how such tendencies are modified by             the learning process itself.                                                                                                                                    The research will use perceptual-motor coordination tasks (visually             specified relative timing patterns between the limbs) as the window             into learning.  In a typical experiment, individual coordination                tendencies will be probed prior to the introduction of a specific               learning requirement.  The probe will require people to match a                 phase relationship (given by a computer generated visual metronome)             between rhythmically moving limbs, which will be changed in 15                  degree steps every 15 seconds over the interval from 0 to 360                   degrees.  These subjects will then be trained with a specific                   phasing pattern (e.g., 90 degrees) that does not correspond to                  those coordination patterns that are well-performed in the probe                (e.g., 0 degrees and 180 degrees).  Knowledge of results will be                provided only during the learning phase, which typically proceeds               over a period of several days.  Further probes will allow learning              to be interpreted in terms of the cooperative or competitive                    interplay between the task to be learned and each individual's                  preferred coordination tendencies.  Kelso's specific theoretical                model captures the entire coordination dynamics as an equation of               motion and leads to a number of testable predictions about                      learning.  This research will examine empirically predictions                   concerning mechanisms of transfer and generalization to other tasks             involving other components, the form (abrupt vs. smooth) that the               learning process exhibits, the various routes or pathways adopted               in learning a new skill, and the factors determining learning rate.             This approach, by identifying dynamic constraints before, during,               and after learning, includes a level of description currently                   missing in learning theory and often completely ignored in                      practical applications.",
