 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a research program in the areas of                 Markov processes, stochastic analysis, spatial point processes,                 chains with infinite memory, large deviation theory, branching                  processes, and stochastic control.  Work on Markov processes will               focus on processes constrained to a subset of their natural state               space, measure-valued processes related to population genetics,                 and models of stochastic networks.  A study of simulation and                   approximation methods for stochastic differential equations will                emphasize asymptotics for the error in approximation.  Work on                  large deviations will include both further theoretical                          developments and applications to simulation and hypothesis                      testing.  Applications of branching processes to problems arising               in fiber optic communication systems will be explored.                          Theoretical development for general stochastic control problems                 will include approximation methodology and existence theorems for               Markov controls and optimal singular controls.  Applications of                 stochastic control will focus on consumption models in the                      presence of mark imperfections.                                                      This award will support a research program in the areas of                 Markov processes, stochastic analysis, spatial point processes,                 and stochastic control.  This research falls within the area of                 probability theory, but is motivated and will be applied to                     problems in a variety of fields:  population genetics,                          engineering, and finance.",
