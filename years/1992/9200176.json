For three                      summers beginning in 1992, ten undergraduate students will each                 spend ten weeks engaged in \"hands-on\" research under the                        direction of one of 19 faculty members who will be matched with                 a student.  The unique aspect of this program is its focus on                   the very high concentration of minority students enrolled in                    community colleges in Los Angeles and other large metropolitan                  areas.  The objective of the program will be to provide a                       comprehensive research experience for these minority community                  college students, who have little if any prior exposure to                      research.  Preference will be given to those minority students                  who have already applied for admission to further study in                      4-year colleges and universities.  Each student will select                     his/her own research advisor, and the nature and scope of the                   research project will be arranged to suit the student's level                   and interests through consultation between the advisor and                      student.  The students will be able to select from areas of                     chemistry including biological catalysis, chemical analysis,                    chemical physics, chemical transformations, separations,                        ecology, electrochemistry, reaction mechanisms and microbial                    conversions.",
