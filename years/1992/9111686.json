 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award is for the Research in Undergraduate Institutions                Program.  The proposed work will examine the structural variations              that occur in amorphous silicon nitride and silicon oxynitride                  films with varying levels of electrical and/or thermal stimulation.             Such structural changes change the physical, chemical and                       electrical characteristics of semiconductor devices, including the              electrical and chemical stability, threshold voltage and radiation              hardness.  If techniques can be developed for reducing the                      structural changes in silicon nitride and oxynitride films, the                 reliability and life of semiconductor devices may be significantly              improved.  In addition, the proposed research will provide                      opportunities for undergraduate students to develop critical skills             in problem solving in the area of solid state technology and to                 encourage them to pursue graduate degrees.                                           Superplastic forming is used to shape high performance alloys              in aerospace applications and will find increased use in its                    application to the forming of titanium aluminides and other, \"next              generation\" aerospace materials.  Better understanding of the                   behavior of materials during superplastic forming will allow the                fabrication of high performance parts at lower cost and with higher             reliability.",
