 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the integration of computer-aided design             methods and computer-aided manufacturing for the production of                  parts with complex contoured surface shapes.  Piecewise continuous              rational polynomials will be investigated as suitable functions for             both design and manufacture of radial plate cams.  The objectives               of this research are to design cam contours with high order surface             continuity, maintain this continuity during the manufacturing                   phase, and test the dynamic performance of the cams.  The test cams             will be compared to control samples prepared using conventional                 design and manufacturing techniques.                                                 This research will determine whether typical production cams               can benefit from improvements in geometric design combined with                 improved manufacturing methods.  Interpolation or approximation of              part contours between the design and manufacturing phases will be               eliminated, using polynomial control algorithms which discretize                the shape function to limits within the resolution of the machine               tool during the manufacturing phase.  Similar techniques may be                 applied to a wide range of parts with complex surface shapes.",
