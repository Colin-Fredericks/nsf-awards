 "awd_abstract_narration": "An intensified CCD (Charged Coupled Device) camera will be                      purchased with this equipment grant; initially, this system                     will be dedicated to experiments on the study of mixing and                     combustion in supersonic flow environments.  When coupled with                  a dedicated pulsed dye-laser system, this equipment will allow                  non-intrusive Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) studies                  of concentration, velocity, temperature  and pressure in an                     existing large-scale facility designed for fundamental studies                  of supersonic combustion, allowing first-time non-intrusive                     fundamental measurements of the nature and mechanisms of                        mixing and combustion in compressible environments over a                       broad range of flow conditions.  Such results will be used for                  comparison with ongoing numerical simulations and for                           development and validation of compressible mixing and                           combustion models.                                                                                                                                              Supersonic mixing and combustion processes are of major                         interest for a future generation of supersonic/hypersonic                       propulsion systems.  There are numerous critical                                processes/problems associated with this combustion mode;                        accurate experimental characterization of flow velocities,                      pressures, temperatures, and species concentrations are needed                  for development of an understanding of these phenomena and                      definition of approaches to achieving efficient fuel                            utilization under supersonic combustion conditions.  There are                  numerous open questions in this area which this facility will                   be uniquely suited to investigate.",
