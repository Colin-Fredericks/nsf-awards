 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to establish a new method for                      nonlinear compliance control using neural nets to explore new                   possibilities in machine learning and control for robots and                    telemanipulators.  Here, compliance is treated as nonlinear                     mapping from a measured force to a corrected motion and is                      represented by a multi-layer neural network, as well as by                      Gaussian networks.  The objectives of the proposed research are                 three-fold.  One is to develop a new method for representing                    \"compliance\" to deal with highly nonlinear, such as by stiffness                and damping matrices.  The second objective is to develop a                     learning methods for the generation and teaching of compliance,                 or force feedback strategies.  The neural network approach allows               us to teach a desired compliance from teaching data acquired from               a human operator.  It does not need explicit feedback laws and                  detailed task models such as those required for conventional                    analytic methods.  It is hoped that the new approach will also                  allow us to transfer human skill in compliant motion control to                 robots and telemanipulators.  The third objective of the proposed               project is to develop a real-time, neural net controller that is                involved directly in the feedback loop of robot control system.                 Efficient methods must be developed to analyze and design the                   nonlinear feedback system in order to accomplish smooth, stable                 responses.  To achieve these goals, three subprojects will be                   conducted.  Their objectives are to:  1.  Establish a theoretical               basis for the neural net representation of nonlinear compliance.                2.  Develop techniques for acquiring teaching data, Processing                  the data, and training a neural network for learning a                          compliance, and 3. Develop a design method for real time, neural                net feedback control in order to accomplish desirable dynamic                   response.",
