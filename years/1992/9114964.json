 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Michael J. S. Dewar is supported by a grant from the                  Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop a                    new semi-empirical self consistent field molecular orbital                      treatment which is capable of being extended to transition                      metals.  The proposed \"fourth generation\" semi-empirical                        parameterization has already been successfully applied to the                   elements C, H, O, and N.  It will now be extended to the                        halogens, and eventually to the transition elements which                       involve d atomic orbitals.  The improved semi-empirical                         parameterization will be applied to a variety of important                      chemical problems including: mechanisms of pericyclic                           reactions; studies of substituent effects; properties of nitro                  compounds; reactions of singlet oxygen; phosphorous and sulfur                  chemistry; and chemistry of non-transition metals.                              %%%                                                                             With the advent of supercomputers coupled with continued                        developments in theory, the field of chemistry is rapidly                       approaching a time when computed chemical properties will be                    reliable enough to substitute for experimental measurements.                    Nevertheless, the computational costs involved with reliable ab                 initio molecular orbital calculations remains high for all but                  the very smallest molecules. Semi- empirical methodologies of                   the type developed by Professor Dewar continue to offer a                       practical alternative to chemists who must deal with large                      molecules such as those encountered in the pharmaceutical                       industry.",
