Its theme is Optical                    Phenomena in Glass.  It follows the traditional Gordon Conference               format with two discussion periods each day and nine discussion                 altogether during the week.  In addition, this conference has two               poster sessions.  Discussion topics link laser and glass in their               multi-faceted symbiotic aspects.  The coverage of topics is                     extensive with the central focus on the optical phenomena in glass.             %%%%                                                                            This Gordon Conference covers topics which are very timely and                  important in many new and exciting technological advances, such as              glass fiber laser for telecommunication industries, and new dopant              ions and optical transitions in fluorescence upconversion processes             for new lasers.",
