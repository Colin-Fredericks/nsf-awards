The               workshop will bring together the experience and knowledge of                    autonomous underwater vehicle technology with the experience that               has been gained through the International Submarine Race program                to foster innovation and technology development through                         competition.  The subject is sufficiently complex and has                       attracted a very large degree of interest so that a workshop of                 invited experts is the best method to advance the concept to                    practice.  This approach will be employed to examine the process                of utilizing competition to foster and evaluate technical                       advances and as a result to develop scenarios with which to                     characterize, evaluate and advance the state of the art of                      Autonomous Underwater Vehicles.  The results of the workshop will               provide the basis for competition based programs for technology                 enhancement and evaluation in the future.",
