The preliminary model will be closely based on                      experimental evidence from alligators  Alligator mississippiensis               and the known properties of cells.  The case for the alligator as               a model for research in craniofacial development is convincingly                made by Ferguson (1981).  In particular the PI's aim to reproduce               a specific pattern, namely the positions and initiation sequence                of the first seven teeth in the right half lower jaw of the                     alligator.  The model will be a quantitative realization of a                   caricature of the descriptive model for tooth formation in                      Alligator mississippiensis described by Westergaard and Ferguson                (1987).                                                                              The mathematical model will involve a system of nonlinear                  coupled partial differential equations describing both the                      mechanical properties of the epithelial and mesenchymal cells as                well as the reaction and diffusion of various chemicals.  Thus,                 the model will include elements of both the reaction-diffusion                  and the mechanochemical approaches to pattern formation, and will               incorporate tissue interaction processes.  In the modelling the                 emphasis will be on the greatest possible biological realism at                 the expense of mathematical simplicity.",
