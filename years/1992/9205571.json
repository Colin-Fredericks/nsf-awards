 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of world fisheries recently has been                       characterized by rapid expansion of total output and volume of                  trade.  This has encouraged coastal nations to expand the                       production capacity of their fisheries to service the                           international market for marine products.  This has led to an                   emphasis on growth oriented comparative advantage approaches                    involving large-scale projects, modern capital intensive                        technology, and heavy injections of foreign and national capital.               One result of this activity has been to transfer priority away                  from production for local markets to production for international               export.  This project examines how these global level economic                  processes have affected local fishing communities in coastal                    India.  Specifically, research will center on how the                           introduction of large-scale mechanization and shifts in local                   production and marketing priorities have affected petty traders                 in terms of their ability to participate in the fish economy of                 two local communities in Kerala state.  Data will be collected                  through interviews, observations of market transactions and                     activities, and from archival records.  These data will form the                basis of a comparative study of market arrangements in the two                  districts before and after the introduction of mechanized                       technology.                                                                          The disruption of long established local economies through                 their integration into the global economy has often had profound                effects on the livelihoods of local producers and traders.  This                research will highlight these impacts in a region which is being                rapidly influenced by forces of change in the global fishing                    industry.  It will merge social and economic processes with                     spatial factors into a single analytical framework for analysis                 of local variation in economic development as a direct result of                changes in the world economy.",
