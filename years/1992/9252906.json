 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science Education for Public Understanding Program                          (SEPUP) will develop, field test nationally and publish two                     one-year courses:  a more concrete course for middle school                     and a course emphasizing global issues for high school.  The                    courses will stress issues-oriented science and the use of                      scientific evidence and risk-benefit analysis in making                         decisions.  These courses will continue the emphasis of the                     Chemical Education for Public Understanding Program (CEPUP)                     on societal issues involving the use of chemicals and expand                    the scope of the program by dealing with other issues in                        life, earth and physical sciences and in technology.  Eight                     new modules will cover many of the large themes of science                      proposed in Project 2061 along with issue-oriented themes                       such as evidence-based decision-making, uncertainty and                         controversy, science and social systems.  Course materials                      will stress students as active participants in doing science                    with the goal of developing independent thinkers able to                        make evidence-based decisions about issues in science and                       technology.  Materials will include a teacher's resource                        book, a student text, projects and extension activities,                        kits videotapes and software.  Assessment of student                            learning is built into the materials.",
