 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide supplementary support to                                enable Dr. Greg Swain of Auburn University to conduct                           collaborative research with Dr. Kingo Itaya for twelve                          months at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.  They                             will apply in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)                          and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques to                                 characterize the solid/solution interface of gold and                           carbon fiber electrode surfaces.                                                                                                                                Despite the fact that they are strongly influenced by                           the microstructure present at the surface, solid                                electrodes are usually studied in a high vacuum.  Such                          a technique does not accurately measure the physical                            and chemical interface properties of the solid                                  electrode surfaces in solutions as they relate to                               electron transfer, adsorption, corrosion and                                    catalysis.  In order to provide insight into the                                nature of these processes, Swain and Itaya will                                 conduct an in situ analysis of single crystal gold                              electrodes in ultraclean solutions using STM and AFM.                           Dr. Itaya's expertise in the use of in situ STM to                              image mono and polycrystalline electrode surfaces will                          complement Swain's experience in electrochemical                                surface spectroscopy and the necessary pretreatment of                          carbonaceous electrodes, and will facilitate the                                understanding of the interaction between ions and                               solvents at the solid/solution interface.",
