Robert Holzman of the University of                         Washington-Seattle and A. M. Feigin, Institute of Applied                       Physics, Nizhny, Novgorod, Russia will be held at the                           Institute in Nizhny in March 1992.                                                                                                                              The Upper Atmospheric Research Section at the NSF is                            committed to cooperation with the international STEP                            program and through its support of scientists in related                        research activities plays a central intellectual role in                        meeting STEP objectives.  In particular the objectives                          relating to the composition of the mesosphere and the                           electrodynamics of the atmosphere are ones that have                            received strong recent emphasis and in which very                               significant recent progress has been made.                                                                                                                      The items to be discussed include preliminary results of                        NCL-91 compain; relation between electrodynamics and                            chemistry of the D-region; polar mesospheric clouds                             (PMSC), relation between NCL and PMSC, mesospheric                              electrodynamics and global electricity, and                                     electrodynamics and minor constituents.
