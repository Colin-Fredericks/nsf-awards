 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a research planning grant to investigate a method for                   determining the parameters of model functions.  This method                     may prove to be less sensitive to noise and more generally                      applicable than commonly used methods such as least-squares                     (LS) and its variations.  The algorithm for this method                         consists of multiplying the original model function by a set                    of \"test functions\" and then integrating to form the inner                      products.  The data points are multiplied by the same test                      functions and numerically integrated.  The two results are set                  equal to one another, yielding a system of constraints on the                   unknown parameters.  For sufficiently many test functions,                      this system of constraints can be solved for the unknown                        parameters.                                                                                                                                                     During the planning period it will be determined whether this                   method is feasible as an alternative to other modeling                          techniques.  In particular, it may be useful when measurement                   errors are not known or there are possible outliers that one                    does not wish to delete.  The method will be applied to a                       variety of data sets, and well-conditioned test functions will                  be examined to improve its performance.",
