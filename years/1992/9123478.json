 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mathematical research supported by this award focuses on               the nature of solutions of differential equations in the complex                domain. Specifically, work will be done investigating algebraic                 differential equations. That is, differential equations in which                the derivatives of the dependent variable enter only                            polynomially. A solution to such an equation is called                          differentially algebraic. The point of view taken in this project               is one of determining the complex calculus one can derive with                  the restricted class of differentially algebraic analytic                       functions. For example, is it possible to classify all such                     entire functions? What, if any, are the growth restrictions on                  such functions? Efforts will also be made to analyze the iterates               of such functions and to establish the extent to which                          interpolation of arbitrary complex sequences is possible at                     prescribed values by a single function in the class.                                 Differential equations play an essential role in modeling                  the physical universe. It is often the case that solutions,                     although known to exist theoretically, may not be expressible by                elementary means. The purpose of this research is to develop                    properties of broad classes of functions that can arise as                      solutions of differential equations and to use these properties                 as part of a comprehensive classification scheme.",
