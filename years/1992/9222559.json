The purpose of this                                                      symposium is to critically review                                               the current status of advanced                                                  oxidation processes being used and                                              considered for use in environmental                                             engineering practice as a step                                                  toward defining further research                                                needs.  Session topics will include                                             ozonation, photolysis and                                                       photocatalysis, non-thermal                                                     plasmas, electron beam radiation,                                               electrohydraulic cavitation and                                                 sonolysis, and supercritical                                                    oxidation.
