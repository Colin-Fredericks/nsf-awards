 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational group theory is an interdisciplinary field                   which involves the use of groups to solve problems in computer                  science and mathematics.  At least three communities have                       strongly influenced this field: (1) the theoretical computer                    science community through studies of the complexity of                          computation with groups and their connections with the complexity               of combinatorial isomorphism or search problems; (2) the symbolic               algebra/computer algebra communities, which have built large                    integrated software packages and have developed CPU efficient                   algorithms for group theoretic computations; and (3) the group                  theory community through continued progress on understanding the                structure of groups, most notably the classification of finite                  simple groups.                                                                       This project will support the DIMACS (Center for Discrete                  Mathematics and Computer Science) Workshop on Groups and                        Computation to be held October 7-10, 1991 at Rutgers University.                Research on computational group theory currently appears in                     diverse forums in both mathematics and computer science.  This                  reflects the role of groups as fundamental mathematical objects                 with a wide range of applicability.  This workshop will bring                   together researchers in theoretical computer science, computer                  algebra, and group theory to discuss group-theoretic algorithms                 for both serial and parallel computer architectures.",
