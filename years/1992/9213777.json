 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop is an NSF-initiated planning workshop to                        determine research problems in the area of virtual reality that                 deserve future funding. \"Virtual Reality\" is thought by many to                 be a poor and inaccurate description of an enormously popular                   field.  It's various descriptions include a set of capabilities                 to deliver a tightly coupled, highly interactive, principally 3D                visual experience in which the user has the feeling of being                    immersed in a 3D computer-generated environment.  Other                         descriptions describe a mixture of simulated objects with                       customary objects, such as images, from real environments.  Even                other descriptions include warping of the perceived visual space                and time or emphasize direct manipulation of objects in the                     virtual reality or the coordinated experience of two or more                    persons in a shared simulation scenario.  The main goals of the                 workshop are to identify the most important areas of basic                      research in virtual reality, to determine the relationship of                   NSF-funded basic research to other programs, and to produce a set               of recommendations on the infrastructure required for sustained                 basic research.  The invitational workshop participants represent               a balance of researchers in the area of virtual reality including               researchers with NSF grants and researchers in government and                   industrial laboratories.  The workshop focused on four research                 areas: perception, human-machine interaction, hardware, and                     applications",
