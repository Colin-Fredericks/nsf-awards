 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large enrollment introductory science courses often share                       several structural and procedural problems, such as lectures                    that survey topics found in encyclopedic biology textbooks, a                   tradition of \"covering\" an ever-expanding body of knowledge, an                 emphasis on memorization and passive learning, and computer                     assisted learning that provides little more than drill                          instruction in taking multiple-choice examinations.  The                        objectives of this project are to: 1) increase active learning                  through wide-spread use of informal writing projects in                         recitation, lecture, and lab, with students writing sample exam                 questions, article summaries, or concept definitions, 2)                        upgrade the course's computer facility to accommodate word                      processing and networked conversational software, so as to                      encourage creativity, and support collaborative learning, and                   3) relate biological principles to relevant social and                          political contexts through specific reading/discussion/writing                  assignments.  Graduate teaching assistants are trained to lead                  discussions and organize students into collaborative                            writing/learning projects, and advanced undergraduate majors                    are employed in the course's computer center as peer tutors and                 leaders of computer-assisted collaborative writing and                          learning.  The effectiveness of this effort in enhancing                        learning by students at this urban university, which enrolls a                  large number of women and minorities, will be evaluated, and                    the results disseminated to other institutions in the region                    and nationally.",
