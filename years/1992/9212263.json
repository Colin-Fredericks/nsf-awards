 "awd_abstract_narration": "What determines private sector expectations about the likely                    timing of discrete changes in government policy?  For example,                  Central Banks often have control over policy instruments -- such                as a nominal exchange rate or a key interest rate -- that can be                adjusted discrete and suddenly.  Mark participants appear to form               expectations about when these adjustments will occur (and about                 how large they will be) and these expectations influence their                  behavior.  Import payments may be accelerated and exports                       postponed in anticipation of a devaluation.  Similarly,                         anticipated changes in interest rates may affect the timing of                  housing purchases or other investment decisions.  One intuitively               appealing model of how market participants might formulate their                expectations is a \"Threshold\" model in which policy changes are                 expected to occur when some underlying indicator(s) cross a                     critical threshold.  The contribution of this research comes from               (1) deriving a Threshold model to explain the actual and expected               timing of discrete policy changes; (2) developing a methodology                 for empirically estimating and testing the Threshold model; and                 (3) suing the Threshold model to study a number of types of                     discrete policy changes.                                                                                                                                        Under certain assumptions the probability functions describing                  the expected timing of policy changes will come from an Inverse                 Gaussian distribution.  This formulation of the Threshold model                 will be used to study the actual timing of policy changes as                    well.  Previous work by the investigator on realignments in the                 European Monetary System will be extended.  Future research will                include a theoretical and empirical analysis of the expectations                about the timing of changes in key U.S. interest rates.",
