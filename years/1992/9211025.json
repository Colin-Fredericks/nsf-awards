 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop a                                       comprehensive theory for designing and analyzing                                adaptive systems for identification, filtering and                              control of unknown linear stochastic systems.  The                              focus of this proposal is to investigate several                                fundamental aspects of stochastic adaptive system                               theory, including adaptive solvability, convergence,                            performance, and robustness.  The specific                                      problems addressed include recursive identification,                            adaptive feedback an feedforward control, adaptive                              filtering and state estimation, adaptive channel                                equalization, adaptive echo cancelling, adaptive                                active noise cancelling and vibration control.                                  Under the topic of adaptive solvability, we examine                             the fundamental issue of whether there exists a self-                           tuning algorithm which automatically tunes itself to                            the correct controller or filter based on on-line                               data, given a filtering or control objective and                                certain a priori information.  Under the topic of                               performance, we consider the issue of asymptotic                                behaviors of signals and parameter estimates for a                              variety of adaptive algorithms and configurations.                              Under the topic of robustness, we propose to                                    investigate several robustness enhancement                                      methodologies, including the filtering of adaptive                              algorithms, a new H00 identification procedure,                                 adaptive control based on instrumental variable                                 identification methods and adaptive internal model                              control.  In addition to theoretical research, this                             project will maintain close ties with several applied                           research projects which include the applications of                             active noise cancelling and vibration control,                                  applied research in smart and adaptive structures,                              research in ghost cancellation in digital high                                  definition TV, and research in automatic vehicle                                control.",
