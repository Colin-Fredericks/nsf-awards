 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal seeks partial funding (50% cost share) for the                publication of a monograph revising the systematics of two genera               of scleractinian corals within the Caribbean region during                      Neogene time.  The monograph has been reviewed and formally                     accepted by the Bulletins of American Paleontology as a separate                volume in part of a series on the Neogene Paleontology of the                   northern Dominican Republic.  Its contents provide a detailed                   documentation of the protocol and rationale underlying                          morphometric analyses performed in research funded by NSF grant                 no. BSR 8605277.  The monograph is unique in being one of the                   first systematic treatments in reef corals to use a rigorous                    quantitative approach in the recognition of species, as well as                 in tracing the distributions of morphospecies through space and                 time.  A total of nine species are recognized altogether,                       resulting in the synonymy of five of 16 previously reported                     species in the Caribbean Neogene.  Only three of these species                  are found to have survived until the Recent, and only two to                    extend back into Oligocene time.",
