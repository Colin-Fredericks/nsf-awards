Dr. Brownikowski's doctoral degree was                 from Stanford University under the supervision of Professor                     Richard Zare. Dr. Brownikowski intends to continue research at                  Wisconsin with Professor Robert Hamers. Dr. Brownikowski's long                 range goal is to understand an manipulate matter on the atomic                  and molecular scale. He has had a strong background in physical                 chemistry through his thesis work involving the laser based                     study of reaction dynamics. In working with Professor Hamers,                   he will have the opportunity to learn the techniques of                         scanning tunneling microscopy. This will help him to implement                  his long term research plans.                                                   %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                    knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and atttract them into                  meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
