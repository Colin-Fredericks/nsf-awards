Exact replicate surveys were designed and                       administered in European Russia and the USA in 1991.  The study                 will analyze these survey data to describe and compare the class                structure in the two countries.  The study will examine                         differences between the US and Russia in attitudes toward                       egalitarianism, the normative link between education, occupation                and income, and attitudes toward state versus private control of                the economy.                                                                         The study will provide a much need comparative perspective                 on social stratification in Russia and the United States and shed               new light on the relationship between social structure and                      stratification processes.  The study also will make an important                contribution to the study of the relationship between type of                   political economy and social mobility and equality of                           opportunity.",
