 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports the participation by a group                of U.S scientists in the Fifth International and U.S.-Pakistan                  Symposium and Workshop on Natural Products Chemistry scheduled to               be held in Karachi, Pakistan in January 1992.  The Pakistani                    organizer is Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman of the H.E.J Postgraduate                       Chemistry Institute at the University of Karachi.  Topics to be                 addressed will include: isolation, structure determination, and                 synthesis of novel biologically active compounds from natural                   sources.  Isolation  methods will emphasize techniques                          appropriate to the isolation of water-soluble marine natural                    products as well as compounds from land organisms.  Special                     emphasis will be placed on synthesis as well as areas of                        biochemistry.  It is expected that additional support will be                   provided by a number of international organization to allow for                 participation by scientists from South Asia and the Middle East.                There is also interest from a number of U.S industrial concerns                 to send representatives at their expense to contribute to the                   discussions during the workshop section, and to explore the                     potential for collaboration and for developments in the technical               areas of the meeting.                                                                                                                                           Scope:  Past workshops in this series have resulted in high                     quality publications that were published in the U.S., Germany and               the Netherlands, and which serve as current references.  Several                collaborative activities have resulted from these workshops.  The               regional nature of the proposed 1992 meeting helps the wide                     exchange of information in that important region where much of                  the world's medicinal plants grow naturally.  The U.S. and                      Pakistani organizers are among the most qualified to direct this                project.",
