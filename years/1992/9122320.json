 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator intends to continue work on generic objects               constructed from 0 and other problems in forcing.  In                           particular, he will attempt to extend S. D. Friedman's work,                    obtaining a non-constructible ZF-Pi-1-2-singleton constructible                 from 0.  Several related problems in set theory will also be                    considered.                                                                          Set theory provides the popular way to lay the foundations                 for all of mathematics, the best known systematic attempt to do                 this being Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica.                       Important foundational questions concern the independence and the               consistency of the axioms used to establish set theory.  Zermelo                and Fraenkel's axioms (ZF for short) are one of the most                        convenient sets of basic axioms.  However, it has been known                    since the work of Kurt Goedel in the 1930's that no axioms for                  set theory can be complete as well as consistent.  This means                   that no set of axioms can be powerful enough to prove every                     possible proposition or else its negation, but not both.  Upon                  this startling theorem has been erected a rich theory, treating                 possible propositions P such that either P or Not P can be added                to ZF without resulting in a contradiction.  Any such proposition               P is said to be independent of ZF and can be taken as an                        additional axiom of set theory.  The principal technique for                    finding such independent propositions is Paul J. Cohen's so-                    called method of forcing and its offspring.  This is the circle                 of ideas involved in and motivating the investigator's research.",
