 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed three year project is based on an equal                            partnership between Hunter College and Community School                         District                                                                        is to help students in grades 4 through 9, particularly                         under-represented groups, achieve their potential in                            mathematics, science and technology.  This will be                              accomplished through staff development for both teachers and                    supervisors and also parent education.                                                                                                                          During the first two years of the project activities will                       focus on teams of at least two teachers from each of the                        schools in CSD                                                                  in workshops and computer based activities for 15 days                          during the spring semester and three weeks in July at Hunter                    College. By the end of the spring semester each participant                     will have a library that includes grade appropriate                             curriculum materials, activities developed by the staff,                        computer discs, laser discs, model lessons, assessment                          instruments and other educational resources.                                                                                                                    Field trips to local industry, environmental activities on                      the River and an intensive three day \"camp\" experience at                       the Mohonk Mountain Reserve are included in the program and                     are designed to help teachers duplicate similar experiences                     with students at a later date.                                                                                                                                  Participating teachers will receive 9 graduate credits in                       mathematics, science and technology education upon                              successful completion of the program.                                                                                                                           Over the three years of the project in all of the six                           community school districts in Manhattan 270 teachers, 32                        supervisors and 300 parents will participate.  This should                      directly benefit over 17,500 students.                                                                                                                          Cost sharing is estimated at 28%.",
