 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adequate blood perfusion of the heart (coronary flow, CF) is                    essential for its performance and survival and until recently it                has been believed that the sole purpose of CF is that of mass                   transfer; namely, to provide nutrients and remove waste from the                myocardium.   However,  recent evidence from our laboratory                     indicates that besides the mass transfer function CF is also a                  stimulus for the cardiac utilization of glucose and oxygen                      (metabolic effects, ME) and a stimulus for the transmission of the              electrical impulse from atria to ventricle (dromotropic effect,                 DE).  In addition, associated with changes of CF there are changes              in two forces that act on the blood vessel wall and consequently                could act as stimulus.  These forces are distention of the vessel               wall (pressure) and frictional forces acting on the surface of the              vessels (shearing).  Our preliminary results have indicated that                shearing is the important stimulus.  Moreover, we reasoned that the             mechanism by which shearing could have a ME and a DE may be via                 deformation of cellular structure(s) on the intravascular wall that             are oriented perpendicularly to the direction of the force.                     Specifically, we are concerned with the sugar-containing protein                (proteoglycans) chains that are embedded in the cell membrane blood             vessels.  To test this hypothesis we decided to \"clip\" selectively              some of these proteoglycans with enzymes; that act as scissors                  removing specific protein chains.  Our preliminary studies show                 that removal of specific proteoglycans containing the sugar heparin             caused the stimulatory effects of shearing on ME and DE to be                   significantly reduced.  Our proposed studies will establish that                the deformation by shearing forces of specific endothelial                      proteoglycans will result in modified cardiac function possibly by              the release of chemical messengers that cause a ME and DE in the                adjacent cardiac cells.  These studies will open new avenues in the             understanding of cardiac function and metabolism.",
