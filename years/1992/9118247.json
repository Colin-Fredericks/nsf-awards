 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the transport pathway from the                        endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosomal membrane. A family of                    recently characterized lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (\"lgp's\")               and their cDNAs will be used to study the molecular requirements                for transport to, and maintenance in, the limiting membranes of                 these terminal degradative compartments.  Site-directed                         mutagenesis and expression of the cDNAs in cultured cells will be               used to define targeting features of lgp's, while antisense RNA                 expression will be used to explore functions.  The apparent                     mistargeting of overexpressed lgp's will be studied to further                  elucidate the regulation of this pathway.  Additional components                of the lysosomal membrane will be characterized to search for                   common targeting features, as well as to further define and                     understand this dynamic organelle.                                                                                                                              Membranes of eukaryotic cells define a diverse set of                           intracellular compartments that are functionally and                            biochemically distinct.  Proteins that span or cross membranes                  are transported from their points of synthesis to their                         appropriate sites of action, often traversing multiple organellar               compartments along the way.  Proteins must therefore possess                    features that are not only essential for their functions, but                   also essential for transport and targeting to their final                       destinations.  To date, few of the latter features have been                    defined.  The results of this project will increase our                         understanding in this fundamental area of cell biology.",
