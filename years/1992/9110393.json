 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our understanding of the genetic population structure and                  evolution of free-living organisms has been greatly advanced by                 the application of molecular techniques.  However, the genetic                  structure of parasitic species has been almost completely                       ignored.  It is proposed to initiate studies of the genetic                     structure of populations of the human-parasitic nematode Ascaris                lumbricoides.  Because so much is known about the biology of this               A. lumbricoides and its host, Homo sapiens, these species could                 serve as a model system for studies relating host and parasite                  population structures.  The following scientific questions will                 be addressed:                                                                        1.  Are genetically similar or geographically close                        populations of humans parasitized by genetically similar                        populations of Ascaris?  Or is there genetic evidence for                       transfer of parasites among geographically separated human                      populations?  Answers to these questions will provide evidence on               how long particular host-parasite associations have persisted at                the population level.                                                                2.  What is the local (within villages) genetic structure of               Ascaris populations?  For instance, are the worms harbored by a                 single family representative of a random sample of worms present                throughout the village, or do host families harbor their own                    genetic subpopulations of parasites?  Such information will                     provide clues about major routes of parasite transmission within                a population, and thus indicate ways that people could reduce                   their worm burdens.                                                                  3.  What are the genetic relationships among parasites                     derived from different host species (humans and pigs)?                          Specifically, do these worms represent different species?  This                 information will shed light on the evolution of host                            specialization in parasitic species.  If the worms in pigs and                  humans are indeed the same species, as we suspect, our results                  will be of significance for animal husbandry and for reducing                   rates of infection of humans that live in association with pigs.",
