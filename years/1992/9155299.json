 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a collaborative effort to provide                       instruction and on-going support in the use of introductory                     biotechnology classroom materials to St. Louis city and county                  teachers of grades 6-8.  Key components of the plan include                     the training of 96 lead teachers (CADRE teams) who will have                    extensive presentation skills for adult instruction and the                     use of a telecommunications network to reach an additional 200                  classroom teachers per year for a total of 600 over the course                  of the project.  These classroom teachers will meet at                          different sites in groups of about 20/site for instruction via                  telecommunication and on-site support from CADRE teams.                                                                                                         This leadership project is appropriate for the Teacher                          Enhancement Program because of its potential to reach a large                   number of classroom teachers in a very cost-effective yet                       substantive way, and because it is a collaborative effort of                    an educational consortium (MSEC), school districts,                             universities and local industry.                                                                                                                                Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 60% of the amount                         requested from NSF.",
