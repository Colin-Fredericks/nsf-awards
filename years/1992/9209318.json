 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the preschool years, children begin to learn that what they              believe or what they see may not always be true.  This insight                  provides the basis for understanding many kinds of behavior.  For               example, understanding that a person might have a belief that is                false (e.g., believing her coat is in the closet when actually it               is on the bed), that people may be confused by misleading                       appearances, and that two people viewing the same event may                     interpret it in different ways all require children to realize that             mental representations do not always correspond to the actual state             of the world.  This research will explore the possibility that                  children first master the distinction between mental                            representations and reality in the domain of pretense.  Children's              ability to maintain a boundary between what is real and what is                 pretend will be investigated in three experiments in which 3- and               4-year-old children will be asked to imagine a variety of objects               under different conditions.  In addition, 150 children aged 3 years             6 months, four years, and four years six months will be given tasks             assessing their ability and inclination to engage in pretense and               their implicit knowledge about mental life.  Children who are                   particularly inclined to engage in pretense are expected to be                  better able to make a clear distinction between what is imagined                and what is real and to be advanced in the development of insight               about the mind (e.g., an earlier understanding that people may have             false beliefs).  Children will also be asked questions about their              fantasy lives, including the existence and characteristics of                   imaginary companions.  Thus, in addition to investigating how early             fantasy is related to cognitive development, this research will                 provide descriptive information about a spontaneous form of                     elaborate pretense that is common (65% of preschool children have               imaginary companions), but is not well understood.",
