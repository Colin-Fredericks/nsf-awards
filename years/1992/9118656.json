 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genes for the oat storage proteins globulin and avenin are                      expressed in a differential manner during seed formation.                       The cause for this differential expression has been studied by                  Dr. Larkins as a component of his research on the biochemistry                  of seed storage proteins.  Preliminary evidence has narrowed the                control of expression to the translation step of the process.                                                                                                   The investigators propose to explore the molecular basis for the                differential synthesis of storage proteins in the oat system.  They             have constructed a series of transcription vectors encoding avenins             and globulins and will analyze the translation of synthetic mRNAs               in both wheat germ extracts and xenopus oocytes.  This analysis                 may allow them to identify structural features of the mRNAs that                cause the preferential translation of the globulin transcripts.                 They plan to prepare a tRNA-dependent in vitro translation system               and assess the role of the tRNA population of oat endosperm in                  storage protein synthesis. This will allow them to determine if                 translation termination or protein transport play a critical role               in regulating storage protein accumulation.  A thorough knowledge               of how storage protein synthesis is controlled will give us insight             into the mechanisms regulating the growth and development of seeds              and provide a basis for future improvements in the nutritional                  quality of oats and other cereals  by genetic engineering.",
