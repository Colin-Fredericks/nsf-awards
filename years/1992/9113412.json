 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a long term visit by                    Professor Slawomir W. Hermanowicz, University of California                     at Berkeley, to the Institute for Water Quality Control and                     Waste Management of the Technical University of Munich,                         Germany.  There he will collaborate with Dr. Peter A.                           Wilderer in the area of mass transfer and hydrodynamics in                      biofilm systems.  Dr. Hermanowicz has been investigating                        microbial attachment to and growth on surfaces, with a                          primary emphasis on dilute systems.  His goal is to develop                     a novel method for assessing biological growth in dilute                        systems such as drinking water distribution networks.  This                     research will be greatly enhanced by a capability to measure                    fluid hydrodynamics near the surface and the effects of                         surface topography on mass transport of particles such as                       bacteria.  Dr. Wilderer is a world expert in biofilms, with                     particular expertise in biofilm structure and ecology.  He is                   currently researching the effects of biofilm surface                            morphology on mass transfer.  During this long-term visit,                      Dr. Hermanowicz will benefit from this expertise and will                       gain experience in the application of Laser Doppler                             Anemometry to the measurement of interfacial transport                          properties in biofilms.                                                                                                                                         Biofilms are formed by microorganisms which attach to                           surfaces.  They are ubiquitous in many natural and engineered                   environments, such as groundwater aquifers, tooth surfaces,                     drinking water pipelines and ship hulls.  The role played by                    the dissolved and particulate components in these systems is                    poorly understood. A better understanding of the growth and                     stability of these films would have applications in                             industrial processes, environmental research and any field                      which adhesion of cells or particles is important.",
