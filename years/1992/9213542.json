 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to conduct an experimental study and model the               functioning of thin film material handling equipment.  This effort,             being conducted in close collaboration with an industrial co-                   sponsor, will result in a better understanding of such material                 handling mechanisms and provide a sound theoretical basis for the               design of thin film handling equipment.  The test equipment that                will be fabricated to conduct the study will be based on the latest             mechatronic design techniques, provide for the variation of                     critical parameters and include sensors and actuators so that the               cause effect relationships can be studied and quantified.                            Material handling of thin films is a frequent occurrence in                many electronic equipment and devices in the industrial and                     consumer sector.  This research will develop a scientific and                   theoretical basis for the design of such equipment, with                        competitive benefits to many producers of such equipment.",
