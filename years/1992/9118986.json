 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this work is to determine the mechanisms of                 evolution of physiological regulatory systems.  We have identified              an excellent model system for such studies:  the gastrointestinal               hormones cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin in the alligator.  We                will test the hypothesis that gastrin and gastrin receptors evolved             from CCK and CCK receptors in the primitive reptilia.  The specific             aims of the proposed studies are to determine the structures of CCK             and gastrin in the alligator and to determine the properties of                 the alligator CCK and gastrin receptors.  Alligators are important              in evolutionary studies because they are closely related to the                 ancient reptiles that gave rise to all modern birds and mammals.                including man.  One of the hallmarks of evolution is the generation             of new systems for regulation physiological processes, such as                  digestion.  This increased sophistication of digestion played a                 major role in the evolution of endothermy, or warm-bloodedness,                 characteristic of birds and mammals.  Endothermy, in turn, allowed              birds and mammals to become much more successful than reptiles.                 Thus, studies of hormones and their responses in alligators will                lead to important new insights into the mechanisms of evolution of              physiological systems crucial to the success of life.",
