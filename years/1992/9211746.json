 "awd_abstract_narration": "I have been studying an apparently mutualistic endosymbiosis,                   between a widely distributed family of marine invertebrate animals              (molgulid ascidian tunicates) and a funguslike protist,                         Nephromyces.  Nephromyces inhabits the ductless \"renal sac\",                    surrounding the urate-containing concretions conspicuously                      accumulated in this molgulid organ.  Nephromyces cells possess high             levels of urate oxidase activity, and are thus metabolizing the                 renal sac urate.  The intracellular site of this activity in                    Nephromyces is unknown; paradoxically, peroxisomes, the usual site              of urate oxidase in eukaryotes, are not obvious in Nephromyces.                                                                                                 I have unexpectedly discovered a third partner in this                          endosymbiosis: intracellular bacteria in the cytoplasm of                       Nephromyuces.  I hypothesize that the activities of these bacteria              are of profound consequence to the biology of the symbiosis as a                whole.  By adapting techniques developed to study compartmentation              of ureide metabolism in legume-rhizobial symbioses, I plan to                   develop cytochemical and immunological techniques to study the                  activities of these bacteria in my system.  I well test the                     hypothesis that the bacteria are the site of urate oxidase activity             in Nephromyces, and, more generally, that the bacteria are serving              as Nephromyces' peroxisomes.  I will also test for the presence of              allantoinase activity (the next step in the uricolytic pathway)                 among all three partners of the symbiosis.  The general technical               approaches developed in this work should be applicable to eventual              elucidation of other steps in urate synthesis and degradation in                the symbiosis, and of other possible metabolic activities of the                bacteria; data gathered through these techniques will also be                   relevant to elucidation of the physiological dynamics of he several             other, less studied, urate-associated endosymbioses found in both               marine and terrestrial ecosystems.",
