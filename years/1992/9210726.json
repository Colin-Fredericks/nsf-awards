 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the research outlined in this proposal is                            two-fold.  First, we intend to develop a systematic                             quantitative theory for the design and analysis of                              robust adaptive control schemes.  The second                                    objective is to develop a methodology for studying                              and improving the transient performance of                                      adaptive control schemes, as also alleviating erratic                           steady state behaviour such as bursting.  The                                   objectives mentioned above relate to two of the                                 outstanding problems in the area of adaptive                                    control.  None of the existing theory (Lyapunov                                 approach, persistence of excitation, etc.) can solve                            these problems in a practical or satisfactory                                   manner.  The lack of such results is a major                                    stumbling block that engineers invariably encounter                             in attempting to put the results of adaptive control                            theory to practice.  The methods we plan to use are                             based on recently obtained breakthroughs in robust                              parametric stability (Kharitonov's Theorem and its                              extensions, calculation of parametric stability                                 margins, connections between parametric and                                     unstructured (Hoo) perturbations) and parameter-                                error compensation methods.  We are motivated by                                the possibility of exploiting these recent results in                           robust parametric (nonadaptive) stability and                                   control to obtain non-conservative (practically                                 useful) stability margins for adaptive systems, and                             to develop effective design schemes for robust                                  adaptive control.  Though the robust adaptive                                   control problem is much more difficult than the                                 corresponding nonadaptive one, the payoff is that                               the results obtained are likely to be more useful.",
