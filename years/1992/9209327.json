 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wavelet analysis is based on the existence of single                       functions whose dilations and translates form bases for function                spaces used in various areas of mathematics.  The theory as                     developed over the past decade has proved its worth through                     important applications to problems in signal processing, data                   compression, and seismic exploration, to name a few.  The                       advantages of wavelet decompositions of functions over more                     traditional harmonic analysis techniques lies in the ability of                 properly chosen wavelets to remain local in time and frequency: a               function and its Fourier transform have representations whose                   coefficients depend only on the values of the function in small                 neighborhoods distributed throughout space.  Most wavelet                       analysis focuses on the representation or approximation of                      functions defined on the entire line or throughout space.  There                is a need to develop wavelet analyses for functions restricted to               intervals.  That is one of the primary goals of this project.                   One cannot take a wavelet theory and simply restrict it to an                   interval.  The end points create obstacles which preclude the use               of a single wavelet.  At issue then is how efficiently can a                    wavelet theory be built on intervals in the sense of using the                  minimal number of auxiliary functions and maintaining the same                  qualities of the wavelet theory.                                                     One drawback of wavelets is their lack of symmetry.  This                  shortcoming can be overcome by using a construction of dual Riesz               bases of symmetric wavelets (one forfeits the use of a single                   wavelet to do all the work and replaces it by two).  The                        adaptation of wavelets to finite intervals also opens the                       possibility for the construction of dual bases in this context.                 Very little work has been done in this direction to date,                       although applications to image processing appear to be very                     promising.  One simple approach to this dual basis construction                 is to consider truncations of existing infinitely supported                     wavelets used in various applications and truncating them.  These               may provide interesting dual bases but they will only be of value               if their conditioning numbers can be held close to unity.  Work                 will be done investigating various examples.",
