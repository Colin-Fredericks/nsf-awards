 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal describes a new of                                                 nondestructive testing and characterization for                                 semiconductor and high Tc superconductor                                        devices.  The technique involves Low-                                           Frequency Noise (LFN) measurements                                              performed at different temperatures and bias                                    conditions to characterize the mechanism(s)                                     generating these fluctuations.  Measurements                                    on three different devices are proposed here.                                                                                                                   The first one involves that characterization of                                 electromigration parameters and prediction of                                   the life-times in VLSI metallization layers and                                 vias.  By performing LFN measurements in                                        accelerated electromigration (EM) conditions                                    such as elevated temperatures and at stressing                                  current densities, one can evaluate the EM                                      parameters like activation energy and current                                   exponent.  Then, these parameters are used to                                   establish a correlation between the life-time of                                the metallization layer and the LFN the film                                    exhibits, which in turn can be used as a                                        predictor of life-time.  These measurements                                     will be performed on multi-layer metallization                                  layers of TiW/W/A1 and via/stud structures.                                                                                                                     Secondly, LFN measurements will be utilized                                     to characterize YBaa2CU3O7-8 thin films and to                                  determine the quality of the film related to its                                composition, crystallinity, Resistance-                                         Temperature (R-T) characteristics, and the                                      critical current.                                                                                                                                               LFN measurements will be performed also on                                      HgCdTe MIS photodiodes to characterize the                                      insulator-semiconductor interface and to                                        enhance the noise performance of these                                          devices as infrared detectors.                                                                                                                                  The significance of the noise characterization                                  techniques lies in their ease, flexibility and                                  most important of all, nondestructiveness.",
