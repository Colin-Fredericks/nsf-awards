 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to carry out basic mathematical                 research in the emerging discipline of the Lie theory of                        semigroups and to explore and develop points of contact of the                  theory with other disciplines such as geometry, control theory,                 and notions of causality in physics.  In the area of control one                considers right invariant vector fields on a Lie group and seeks                to understand various attainability questions as controllability                and maximality with respect to Lie saturation.  In casuality, the               tangent objects in the Lie theory of semigroups, the Lie wedges,                give rise in a natural way to homogeneous casual manifolds.  One                seeks a better understanding of when the resulting manifolds have               such desirable physical properties as being strongly casual or                  globally hyperbolic (as useful property for solving partial                     differential equations on the manifold).  Another line of                       proposed research centers on the development of a semigroup                     approach to topological dynamics via the Ellis semigroup.                            The Lie theory of groups is a highly developed theory.  It                 brings modern analysis and modern algebra to bear upon geometric                objects which arise in mathematical physics and in the theory of                differential equations.  This theory has been very successful in                answering difficult and important questions, and equally, in                    suggesting promising lines of inquiry.  Semigroups are algebraic                systems related to groups but without so much structure.  They                  have a role to play in mathematics and some applications, but                   they do not have the central importance that groups have come to                enjoy.  Their Lie theory has not been so thoroughly investigated,               partly for this reason, partly because of difficulties in seeing                how to proceed.  Professor Lawson has overcome some of these                    difficulties and has made impressive progress in putting the Lie                theory of semigroups on a firm footing.  He will continue to                    pursue this line  of inquiry and its ramifications in related                   areas of geometry, control theory, and mathematical physics.",
