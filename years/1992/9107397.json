 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will extend the long-term studies of genetics,               ecology and behavior of African lions.  The study includes two                  contrasting populations.  The Serengeti contains a very large                   outbred population whereas the population in Ngorongoro Crater is               descended from 15 founders and has been genetically isolated for                five generations.  Future work will investigate why the Center                  population has comparable variability in minisatellite DNA to the               Serengeti, whether the inbred Crater population is                              immunologically impaired as a result of its loss of diversity in                MHC genes, and whether declining reproductive performance in the                Crater population is due to persistent inbreeding.  Because many                species of large mammals are increasingly restricted to small                   ecological \"islands\" and are hence subject to increasing levels                 of inbreeding, this research will be valuable in assessing the                  kinds of genetic and epidemiological problems that may commonly                 affect such small populations.                                                       Ecological studies will focus on the factors that regulate                 lion population size and test whether density dependence directly               operates on the number of individuals in the population or on the               number of groups.  Finally, behavioral studies will focus on the                unusually long period of dependency of subadult lions.  The                     protracted development of young lions is more typical of primates               and suggests that subadults which remain in their natal prides                  for longer periods may become more proficient foragers (both as                 hunters and as scavengers).  Subadults play an active role in                   defending the pride territory against neighboring groups, and                   this proposal will explore the ontogeny of territorial behavior                 of subadults with playback experiments.",
