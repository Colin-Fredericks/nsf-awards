These two different meteorological                                              phenomena have separate statistical                                             distributions and, based on the                                                 Phase I results, should not be                                                  handled using a single (mixed)                                                  distribution, as is currently the                                               case.  From the Phase I study, it                                               appears that there may be many                                                  sites in the United States where                                                thunderstorm winds dominate the                                                 extreme wind climatology (for the                                               return periods relevant to                                                      conventional structural design) and                                             that the traditional approach tends                                             to underestimate the design winds                                               and too narrowly models the wind                                                directionality distribution.  Since                                             thunderstorms differ from large-                                                scale extratropical winds in the                                                details of wind structure, storm                                                duration, frequency, and                                                        directionality, these differences                                               could have an important influence                                               on the future codification of                                                   design winds, the safety of                                                     structures, and wind tunnel testing                                             in the United States.                                                                                                                                           The objective of the Phase II                                                   research is to evaluate the                                                     importance and merits of treating                                               thunderstorm gust front winds as a                                              separate and distinct wind loading                                              event.  The integrated research                                                 plan includes three basic tasks:                                                (1) develop wind engineering models                                             of the spatial and temporal                                                     characteristics of thunderstorm                                                 gust fronts; (2) analysis of                                                    thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm                                               windspeed and direction statistics                                              at selected sites; and (3) evaluate                                             the effects of thunderstorms on                                                 structural response for several                                                 categories of structures.  The work                                             could have nationwide significance                                              and, if successful, influence                                                   future wind load design criteria in                                             the United States and other                                                     countries where thunderstorms are                                               important  contributors to extreme                                              wind frequencies.",
