 "awd_abstract_narration": "Telomeres, the specialized structures at chromosome ends, are                essential for the replication and maintenance of chromosomes.                   Telomeres are composed of highly repetitive DNA and proteins that               interact with thtat DNA.  The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii telomere                repeat sequence, (T4AG3)n, conforms to the telomere repeat motif                (TnAG3) where n=2 in vertebrates, n=3 in plants, and n=4 in                     Chlamydomonas.  The telomere DNA from yeasts and ciliates has been              studied extensively; it is very G-rich and, in vitro, the G-strand              readily folds into G-G base paired DNA structures that are                      unusually stable.  The C. reinhardtii telomere DNA is not G-rich,               and, while the G-strand can fold into G-G base paired structures,               these structures are not stable.  Chlamydomonas is a unicellular                model organism that can be sstudied using classical and molecular               genetics and that has regular telomere repeat sequences.  A                     protein, Chhlamydomonas G-strand telomere binding protein (CGTBP),              that binds specifically to the C. reinhardtii G-strand telomere                 repeat sequence T4AG3 has been identified and a gene that encodes               this activity has been cloned.  The CGTBP gene will be sequenced                and its deduced coding sequence will be compared to known protein               sequences. CGTBP will be analyzed biochemically and the protein                 will be localized in the cell by immunomicroscopy.  Transcript                  and/or protein accumulation will be monitored thtrough the cell                 cycle.  The phenotypes of cells that have altered levels of CGTBP               will be studied by transformation of Chlamydomonas cells with the               CGTBP gene in the sense or antisense orientation under the control              of regulated promoters.                                                         %%%                                                                             In eukaryotic cells, the genetic information is encoded by DNA,                 which is packaged with associated proteins into structures called               chromosomes.  The chromosomes have highly specialized regions at                their linear ends, called telomeres, which are essential for DNA                replication, and may have additional functions in the cell cycle.               These regions contain characteristic tandemly repeated DNA                      sequences and proteins which interact with those repeated                       sequences.  Very little is known about these telomeric proteins.                This project will provide a great deal of structural information                about one such telomeric protein, and has the potential to provide              information about its function also.",
