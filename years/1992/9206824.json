The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a three-month postdoctoral research visit               by Dr. S. Craig Cary of Oregon State University to the Institut                 Francais de Recherche pour L'Exploitation de La Mer (IFREMER)                   to work with Dr. Daniel Desbruyeres.                                                                                                                            The discovery of the deep-sea hydrothermal vents revealed a                     unique community of marine invertebrates solely supported on                    reduced carbon fixed by chemoautotrophic endosymbiotic bacteria.                The restricted geography of these deep-sea vents and geochemically              similar habitats lends itself to interesting questions concerning the           diversity and distribution of the free-living bacteria.  An                     unprecedented collection of bacterial isolates from a range of                  hydrothermal and cold-seep sites has been established at                        IFREMER.  Dr. Cary and Dr. Desbruyeres will examine the                         phylogeny and distribution of deep-sea bacteria within and between              hydrothermal and cold-seep habitats.  Isolates of autotrophic                   bacteria from different geographic locations and depth ranges will              be examined.  16S ribosomal RNA sequence analyses will be used                  to determine the genetic diversity and relationship  of the bacteria.           Computer comparisons of these sequences with established                        sequence data bases will allow phylogenetic analysis to define the              structure of the microbial community.  The genetic diversity of                 bacteria found associated with the tube-dwelling vent polychaete                Alvinella pompejana will also be ascertained and compared to the                free-living and endosymbiotic representatives.                                                                                                                  The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                  travel and a stipend for three months.",
