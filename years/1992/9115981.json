 "awd_abstract_narration": "9115981  Pohl      Disorder in thin metallic and dielectric films on polished  crystalline silicon substrates is investigated by measuring heat  flow in the substrate.  Below several degrees K, the phonons will  not be scattered in the substrate; thus any scattering observed  will be induced by the disorder in the films.  A second study  focuses on the effect of dimensionality on the observation of  mechanical relaxation phenomena.  Thin metallic and diekectric  films will be deposited on silicon paddle oscillators.  The  technique has been refined so that it is sufficiently sensitive to  detect amorphous films less than 1nm thick.  One of the questions  to be answered is whether the relaxation which is characteristic of  all amorphous solids can also be observed in extremely thin films,  or only in extended, three dimensional bodies.  % % %  Thin films of metals or electrical insulators play an increasingly  important role in modern technology, e.g. as components in  integrated circuits in the semiconductor industry.  The current  study focuses on characterizing such films by measuring their  thermal and elastic properties.  A specific example are  microcrystalline films of fullerines (buckyballs).  In addition to  exploring their disorder, the potential of such films for storing  gases like helium or hydrogen will be investigated.  Preliminary  measurements have sshown an extremely high solubility for helium.   If a similar solubility could be achieved for hydrogen, this could  have considerable practical applications for energy storage.  ***",
