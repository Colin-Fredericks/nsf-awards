 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to permit Dr. Arthur J. Freeman,                      Department of Physics, Northwestern University, to pursue with                  Dr. Jae Il Lee, Department of Physics, Inha University, Dr. Soon                Cheol Hong, Department of Physics, University of Ulsan, and Dr.                 Byung Il Min, Department of Physics, Pohang Institute of Science                and Technology (POSTECH), for 24 months, a program of cooperative               research on structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of                  bulk solids, surfaces, and interfaces.  In this project, these                  scientists will use newly developed computational                               methods/algorithms which are the product of their past                          collaboration.  A wide range of phenomena will be investigated                  jointly using these computational methods, including the                        structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of metals,                      semiconductors, insulators, and their compounds, overlays, and                  superlattices.                                                                                                                                                  This research is based on the assumption that the properties of                 macroscopic samples of solid material are related to and can be                 derived from the electronic structure of individual molecules and               atomic building blocks of that material.  A high degree of                      reliability  concerning predictions of physical and chemical                    properties and phenomena has been achieved using highly                         sophisticated, fully self-consistent local density computer codes               for the calculation of electronic structures of these materials.                A wide range of phenomena will be investigated.  Applications                   include understanding the properties and design of new                          intermetallic compounds and artificial materials.  The                          collaborators are highly respected scientists in the field of                   this research.  Their past collaboration has resulted in                        significant contributions to the literature of this field.  This                project will provide valuable support for the PI's work with the                (U.S.) multi-institutional Materials Research Group on the                      Magnetic Properties of Materials.  This project is relevant to                  the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program                    which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and               Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of                         scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through               collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean                            participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science                  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).",
