 "awd_abstract_narration": "Major disasters repeatedly focus attention on the need for              thorough assessment of the ways that people (both individually                  and collectively) assess threats beforehand and respond to                      disruptions during and after catastrophic events.  Geographers                  have focused their attention in recent years on locational                      factors and on the interactions among a broad range of variables                that affect human perceptions of and responses to catastrophic                  events.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will provide                 support for a team of experienced scientists who will explore                   different facets of the response of people in southern Florida to               the ravages of Hurricane Andrew in August 1992.  Through field                  observation, acquisition and analysis of data, and elicitation of               reactions through focus-group discussions, the scientists will                  investigate a number of related factors, including (1) decision-                making processes related to the evacuation, return, and                         relocation of residents; (2) dissatisfaction with governmental                  planning and responsiveness; (3) geographic patterns of                         evacuation; and (4) comparisons of evacuation and other coping                  strategies used by individuals.                                                         This project will provide valuable new insights in a number             of different yet complementary ways.  Because the proposed                      project is effectively grounded in current theoretical                          understandings of risk assessment and risk response, it has great               potential for providing a more complete basis for assessment of                 general principles governing human behavior in extremely                        stressful and disrupted situations.  The project also should                    provide valuable new insights about the strengths and liabilities               of a number of different emergency-response strategies.  This                   policy-relevant knowledge should enable governments at all levels               and other organizations to make sounder judgments regarding                     planning for future catastrophes and management of activities                   during and after disruptive events.",
