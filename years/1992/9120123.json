 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nematodes are microscopic invertebrates found in all ecosystems.                They are particularly abundant in soils, where they live in water               films surrounding soil particles. They play an important role in                nutrient cycling in soil food webs by feeding on microscopic plants             and animals as well as bacteria and other decomposers. This study               will continue the first intensive ecological investigation of                   nematodes in the Dry Valley ecosystems in Antarctica. During the                1990 and 1991 austral summers, Nematodes were found to occur in Dry             Valley soils over a wide range of soil properties (moisture,                    salinity, nitrogen and carbon contents). The proposed research will             increase our understanding of the abundance and trophic role of                 nematodes by sampling them in various habitats (soil properties and             microbial activity) from a wide range of soil formations,                       elevations and locales in the Dry Valley region of southern                     Victoria Land. In response to harsh conditions nematodes can assume             a cryptobiotic state in which their metabolism becomes undetectable             and there are both physiological and morphological changes to the               animals. Studies of cryptobiosis in the field and laboratory will               determine the potential duration of nematode activity in this cold              desert and will complement research on nematode population                      dynamics. A field experiment will be conducted to examine the                   response of nematodes and total soil microbial activity to                      temperature, moisture and energy availability in the soil. Total                soil response will be determined as carbon dioxide efflux and                   substrate-induced respiration, a measure related to soil microbial              biomass. The genetic diversity of populations of the dominant                   nematode in the Dry Valleys will be evaluated using molecular                   biology techniques. It is hypothesized that if nematodes are easily             dispersed by wind, this diversity will be comparable over a wide                area.",
