Polytechnic will identify and recruit minority women                 students from high school and from two year college programs for                its undergraduate programs in materials science research.                       Precollege students will participate in a summer research program               and enroll in a summer math preview/review course prior to                      beginning their first semester as Polytechnic undergraduates.                   Selected students enrolled in two year programs in the physical                 sciences at nearby schools will also participate in the summer                  programs.  Students who would benefit from a  \"preresearch                      experience\" will take the Spring Forward Saturday program prior to              undertaking summer research.  Students in two year programs will be             advised and counseled to facilitate their transfer to Polytechnic               as upper level undergraduates.  All precollege and undergraduate                participants will receive advisement about academic coursework that             prepares them for enter into strong graduate programs.                          Undergraduate minority and women peer counselor/tutors will work                with students in small groups to enhance learning.  Students will               receive mentoring and counseling from faculty, graduate students                and undergraduate peers the research laboratory environment.                    Students will attend seminars, participate in visits to graduate                programs and to industry, and prepare oral and written reports                  based on research.  Upper level research students will be                       encouraged to give presentations at meetings of professional                    societies.  Students will receive assistance in preparing graduate              school applications.",
