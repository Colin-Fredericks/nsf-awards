 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pathways of carbon-flow in depositional environments can be                     identified using biomarker identities and distributions in                      conjunction with compound-specific isotope analyses.  The factors               influencing the isotopic composition of individual compounds can be             interpreted in terms of known processes affecting bulk organic                  matter.  However, this approach is limited and there is a lack of               data for individual compounds in modern environments.  This work                aims to characterize isotopic consequences of biogeochemical                    processes at the molecular level, specifically for those processes              associated with the production and degradation of organic matter in             the water column.                                                                                                                                               The ultimate goal is to expand the role of carbon isotopes in                   marine and organic geochemical research.  Three efforts towards                 this goal are proposed.  1) The first is to establish a facility                for the isotopic analyses of organic compounds at Pennsylvania                  State University.  2) This facility will be used to continue                    research started during the P.I.'s graduate studies, specifically,              to characterize processes that control the isotopic compositions                and distributions of individual compounds.  3) The facility at PSU              will be used to foster workshops and iterlaboratory comparisons of              irm-GCMS operations and performance.  In addition, it will enable               further analytical developments if urn-GCMS and related methods.",
