The novelties in proposed approach                                   are the use of two different material systems                                   for achieving optimum pup and npn HBTs on                                       the same substrate and the use of InP                                           substrates which makes the proposed                                             complementary HBTs integratable with                                            optoelectronic devices.                                                                                                                                         During the time covered by the Research                                         Planning Grant, the necessary theoretical                                       development that will lead to guidelines for                                    the design of the optimum complementary                                         HBT structures will be accomplished.                                            Experimentation leading to the production of                                    the complementary HBT structure will be                                         initiated with emphasis on the                                                  InA1As/InGaAs structure.  In addition, with                                     material provided by the Naval Research                                         Laboratory, in Washington, DC demonstration                                     of a functional pnp InGaAs/InAlAs HBT will                                      be accomplished.  Although, initial efforts will                                emphasize InP lattic match material systems,                                    future plans are to expand to pseudomorphic                                     layers in material systems with more promising                                  characteristics.",
