 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large boundary layers and slow diffusion rates of dioxide in               water can lead to limitations in growth and photosynthesis of                   aquatic and saturated plants. Although investigators have sought                to characterize the physiological mechanisms that facilitate carbon             uptake in water, little work has focused on the  role of morphology             in reducing boundary layer resistances in aquatic habitats. Species             in the moss genus Sphagnum exhibit morphological variation that                 preliminary studies indicate is correlated with position along the              water gradient. Thus, the genus can be used as a model system to                investigate the relationship among morphology, boundary layer                   properties and physiological ecology. Also, because the genus is                taxonomically well studied phylogeny can be developed and modern                methods of comparative biology used to test hypotheses of                       adaptation.                                                                          The major goals of this proposed study are as follows: 1) to               determine the extent that morphology and habitat are correlated in              Sphagnum; 2) to measure boundary layer conductance for plants along             the water gradient and describe its relationships to morphology;                3) to demonstrate that differences in boundary layer conductance                lead to carbon limitations for non-aquatic Sphagnum at submerged                CO2 levels; and 4) to test whether functional characters are                    adaptations using historical evidence from a constructed phylogeny.",
