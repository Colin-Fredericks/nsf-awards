 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cedar Point Biological Station is operated by the                      University of Nebraska for grassland research.  The Station is                  adjacent to mixed prairie, sandhills prairie, sand-sage prairie,                and short grass prairie, and adjoins a reservoir on the North                   Platte River.  Several hybrid zones occur in this area of habitat               transition.  Dr. Anthony Joern, Director of the Station, plans                  construction of a research laboratory building in which                         biochemical analyses can be conducted.  This building would                     replace an 11-year old trailer, and would expand the analytical                 activities at the site.                                                              Cedar Point is well-supported by the University of Nebraska,               and the Station is facilitating research by a rapidly growing                   number of investigators.  The Station has established important                 research collaborations with the NSF-supported Long-Term                        Ecological Research Site at Kansas State University, and the new                laboratory building is essential to the analyses involved in this               research.  Prairie-based research is important to agriculture and               to our understanding of global change and biodiversity.  The                    proposed lab construction will enhance research in both of these                areas.",
