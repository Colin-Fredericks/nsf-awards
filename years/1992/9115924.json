 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accretionary prisms form along the landward side of deep sea                    trenches in response to offscraping of oceanic sediments during                 lithospheric subduction.  Several interrelated factors influence                the evolution of these thick sediment prisms including sediment                 composition, physical properties, rate of underthrusting, and fluid             de-watering and migration within the offscraped sediment.  Fluid                migration and expulsion play an important role in the mechanical                behavior, fluid pressure and lithification of sediments in the                  deformation zone.                                                                                                                                               The present renewal award will complete study of the structure of               the Oregon accretionary margin using multichannel seismic                       techniques.  Under previous funding, 2000 km of data was acquired               along this margin.  Progress in analyzing the data has been                     excellent.  Both the sources and migration pathways of fluids can               be imaged in the data.  Continued analysis and interpretation will              focus on:  1) the role of basement topography in controlling                    structural evolution of the margin; 2) the nature of the fault zone             along which underthrusting occurs; 3) oblique faults which were                 discovered during initial analysis of the data; and 4) the porosity             of the sediment sequence.  These data are the basis for a major ODP             drilling cruise to the area in late 1992.",
