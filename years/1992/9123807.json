 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Cristina Amon of Carnegie Mellon                  University (CMU) to collaborate in mechanical engineering                       research with Professor F. Mayinger of the Institute for                        Thermodynamics of the Technical University of Munich, Germany.                  The objective of their research is to quantify and gain a                       better understanding of the physics of heat transfer                            enhancement in supercritical, self-sustained, oscillatory                       flows, such as those found in compact heat exchangers for                       cooling electronic systems.  The numerical and analytical part                  of their joint research will be developed at CMU under the                      direction of Professor Amon.  The experimental part of the                      research will be conducted at the Technical University of                       Munich by Professor Mayinger and others, using real-time                        holographic interferometry and high-speed cinematography.                                                                                                       Heat transfer plays an important role in the reliability and                    efficiency of a great many mechanical and electronic systems.                   Optimizing such transfer is being given more and more attention                 in the design of systems needing compact heat exchange                          surfaces.  These include many applications in energy-related                    devices, electronic cooling, cryogenics and aerospace                           applications.  The proposed cooperative research will develop                   and validate a mathematical model of heat transfer enhancement.",
