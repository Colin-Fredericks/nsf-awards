 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to clone and characterize                    induced cytochrome P450 cDNA(s) from hepatic tissue of the fish,                Chaetodon capistratus, and develop quantitative assays for                      cytochrome P450 mRNA and enzyme levels.  Induction of cytochrome                P450 gene expression will be characterized in C. capistratus using              two model substrates:  1) beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF), a 3-                   methylcholanthrene type xenobiotic and 2) curcuhydroquinone, and                ichthyodeterrent allelochemical from the gorgonian coral,                       Pseudopterogorgia rigida.  Characterization utilizing the first                 substrate will address the potential use of C. capistratus as an                environmental biomonitor in coral reef environments.                            Characterization utilizing the second substrate will address the                effect of an ichthyodeterrent allelochemical on P450 induction.                 Taken together, the evolutionary relationship between                           detoxification of these two classes of foreign compounds can be                 addressed.  Furthermore, the potentially confounding effect of                  dietary allelochemicals on xenobiotically induced P450 will be                  investigated.  Field sampling sites with and without recent                     polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure will then test the               feasibility of using C. capistratus cytochrome induction as a                   biomonitor of environmental contamination.                                                                                                                      Coral reefs are ecologically and economically important                         environments which are increasingly being subjected to detrimental              anthropogenic influences, but effective monitoring mechanisms are               lacking.  Chronic, sublethal effects of pollution due to                        contamination by PAH and synthetic organic chemicals, though not                readily apparent, can become lethal.  The ability to detect low                 levels of contaminants may be crucial for preventing long-term                  damage.  There are presently no molecular studies which have                    characterized a PAH-induced P450 in a tropical marine organism.                 Characterization of C. capistratus P450 will not only add to our                knowledge of the diversity of this biologically important class of              enzymes, but more importantly will provide a molecular probe with               which to assess questions of ecological as well as environmental                significance with great sensitivity.  In particular, is cytochrome              P450 responsible for the ability of C. capistratus to feed on                   gorgonian corals which are otherwise defended by ichthyodeterrent               allelochemicals.  This finding has potentially broad significance               for understanding patterns of predation and herbivory in the marine             environment.  Molecular characterization of C. capistratus P450 and             the development of molecular probes to test the effects of                      chemicals at sublethal levels thus has applicability to important               environmental and ecological questions.",
