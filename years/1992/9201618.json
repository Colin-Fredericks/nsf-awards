They will utilize Bottenberg's                                       expertise on insect-born plant virus diseases                                   to study the effects temperature has on A.                                      solani, the sole vector of soybean dwarf virus                                  (SDV).                                                                                                                                                          SDV, a serious disease of soybeans in Japan and                                 a potential threat to legume production world-                                  wide, is transmitted by an aphid, A. solani,                                    that feeds and multiplies on soybeans.  The                                     factors that influence the reproduction and                                     mortality of this aphid species and the spread                                  of SDV are not well understood, although recent                                 data from Japan suggests that temperature may                                   play an important role in these processes.                                      Bottenberg and Miyai will investigate the                                       impact of temperature on vector population                                      growth, vector feeding behavior, vector                                         dispersal, SDV transmission, and SDV spread.                                    The specimens, fields, and facilities of the                                    Experiment Station, as well as Dr. Miyai's                                      expertise in A. solani will complement Dr.                                      Bottenberg's experience with aphid-born viruses                                 and will facilitate the development of a                                        simulation model that can be used to predict                                    and prevent SDV outbreaks and soybean yield                                     loss.",
