 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award supports two visits by Dr. Philip R. Brooks of Rice                   University to the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New                   Zealand, to work with Dr. Peter W. Harland on complementary                     experiments probing the effects of molecular orientation during                 collision.  At Rice, collisional ionization (or \"electron                       transfer collisions\") are being studied at energies of a few eV,                and the group at Canterbury is initiating studies of electron                   bombardment ionization of oriented molecules.  In both these                    studies, molecules in molecular beams are state-selected in an                  inhomogeneous electric field, and then oriented in a weak uniform               electric field.  The orientation can thus be specified (and                     changed) to study its effect on various collisional processes.                  The need to orient molecules and to guide charged particles into                or away from the collisional region is common to both programs.                 The Rice group has extensive experience in charged particle                     optics and mass spectrometry.  This complementary expertise in                  ongoing research justifies this cooperative research.",
