 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is concerned with work in finite group theory.                  The principal investigator is interested in those groups, such as               solvable groups and certain related families, which have an ample               supply of normal subgroups.  The primary concern is with the                    character theory of these groups.  In particular, he will                       investigate the interactions between certain characters of a                    group, characters of particular subgroups and sets of prime                     numbers.  He will also continue to work on questions related to                 the theory of M-groups.                                                              A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.                 It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and                chemistry.  The fundamental building blocks of finite groups are                finite simple groups.  One of the major results in mathematics of               the past decade is the classification of the finite simple                      groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal               pages.  This research is aimed at using this classification in                  the study of arbitrary finite groups.",
