 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major concern of Conservation Biology is the measurement                 and preservation of genetic diversity (degree of genetic                        variation) particularly where rare and endangered species are                   involved.  This is so because genetic diversity is recognized as                being necessary for maintenance of healthy populations and for                  determining the evolutionary potential (such as the potential for               new species to evolve) of natural populations.  It is proposed                  that island plant species that have evolved through adaptive                    radiation (diversification into  a variety of habitats from a                   single introduction) can provide the model systems for analysis                 of the amount and structure of genetic diversity for rare plants                in general.  The genus Tetramolopium in the Sunflower family                    presents a unique opportunity to analyze genetic diversity in                   rare species.  The genus occurs only on oceanic islands in the                  Pacific Ocean and has an unusual distribution among New Guinea,                 Hawaii, and the Cook Islands.  Ten of the eleven Hawaiian species               are considered rare and endangered.  Based on available evidence                New Guinea is the source area where Tetramolopium evolved and was               later dispersed to the other Pacific islands.                                        The two specific goals of the research are:  1. To assess                  the initial amount of genetic diversity that was introduced into                Hawaii and compare this value to those found in the present                     Hawaiian species.  This will be accomplished by comparing genetic               diversity in New Guinea species to those in Hawaii through use of               two independent molecular techniques.  2. To determine how many                 genes are involved in the process of adaptive radiation in                      Hawaiian species and estimate the proportion of the total gene                  pool represented by these genes.  This will be one of the first                 non-domesticated plant species to have the number of genes                      controlling morphological differences determined and mapped.  The               results of this research will provide detailed information that                 will be invaluable for the management of threatened and                         endangered plant species.",
