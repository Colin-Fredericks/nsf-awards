 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Menger will                 utilize both experimental and theoretical approaches to                         identify the origins of intramolecular and enzymatic                            reactivity.  The systems chosen for study are constructed so                    that two functional groups are held by a rigid molecular                        scaffold in a manner such that their mutual geometric                           relationship is well defined.  Three additional projects will                   be undertaken: (i) the chemistry of \"clumps\", an evolutionary                   approach to catalysis, (ii) construction of a                                   cyclodextrin-based system that contains three catalytic                         entities, and (iii) an attempt to explain why general base                      catalyses in organic models, but not in enzymes, display such                   small effective molarities (EMs).                                               %%%                                                                             The long-term goal of Dr. Menger's research program is to                       identify the various structural and configurational factors                     that determine reactivity in intramolecular and enzymatic                       reactions.  Dr. Menger has designed several systems that                        utilize \"enforced proximity\" in an effort to learn how two or                   more functional groups behave when covalent and noncovalent                     bonding force them to reside in close mutual proximity.  The                    results obtained from such studies are expected to be germane                   not only to chemical dynamics in solution but also to enzymatic                 systems, where the binding to the enzyme forces substrate                       molecules into close contact with catalytic groups.",
