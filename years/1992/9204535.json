 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study a variety of problems in             differential geometry and differential topology.  The main goal of              the research is to develop a deeper understanding of global                     topological and geometrical properties of surfaces in R3 that                   satisfy some nice geometrical or variational principle.  Particular             emphasis will be placed upon:  1.  The global geometry and topology             of properly embedded minimal surfaces:  existence theorems,                     topological obstructions, total curvature theorems, conformal                   structure, topological uniqueness, computation of the index of                  examples, extension of isometries, uniqueness of minimal graphs of              logarithmic growth over noncompact domains, area growth estimates               for ends.  2.  Global geometry of constant mean curvature in R3 and             hyperbolic 3-space.  3.  Computation relevant to problems in the                subject.  4.  Geometry of isotopy surfaces in R3.                                    A classical topic in geometry is the nature of surfaces of                 minimal area having a specified boundary, the so-called soap film               problem, which can be illustrated by dipping a wire frame into a                soap solution and examining the film formed when it is withdrawn.               Ignoring gravity, such films are known to have Gaussian curvature               zero everywhere.  A slightly more general physical situation calls              for surfaces with constant but not necessarily zero curvature.                  Problems about such surfaces abound, and while natural and often                simple to state, they are surprisingly difficult and have inspired              the creation of powerful methods drawing on diverse areas of                    mathematics.  Such problems and methods are the heart of this                   project.",
