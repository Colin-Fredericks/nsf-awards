 "awd_abstract_narration": "The upwelling of nutrients in Equatorial Pacific waters enhances                plankton biomass and primary production over a large area and                   may account for a significant fraction of the global new                        production.  Nitrate persists in the euphotic zone in an area a                 few hundred kilometers north and south of the upwelling axis and                several hypotheses have been advanced to account for the apparent               inability of the phytoplankton to fully utilize it. This project                hypothesizes that grazing controls phytoplankton biomass and that               recycling of nutrients provides much of the phytoplankton                       nitrogen requirement.                                                                                                                                           This study will utilize new techniques which have been applied                  over the last few years in the Sargasso Sea and the JGOFS North                 Atlantic Bloom Experiment to test the grazing/regeneration                      hypothesis as part of the U.S JGOFS Equatorial Pacific program.                 This hypothesis implies specific patterns and distributions of                  nitrogenous nutrients, their utilization and regeneration, and                  natural N isotope abundance in nutrients and suspended and                      sinking particulate material.  This project is collaborative with               Chris Garside (9022726) and consists of two major components:  1)               nutrient concentration measurements of high precision (nanomolar                sensitivity where necessary) and high spatial resolution; 2) low                level and high sensitivity tracer studies of their biological                   uptake and transformations. The results of this study will                      constitute an assessment of the relative importance of \"new\" and                \"regenerated\" nitrogen in the Equatorial Pacific region. The                    principal mechanisms regulating production will be identified,                  and the extent to which \"new\" production contributes to particle                flux and carbon sequestration will be assessed.",
