 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research effort is directed at developing improved global                  illumination algorithms for image synthesis.  Monte Carlo                       techniques avoid artifacts due to the discretization of the                     environment required for radiosity methods and are favored                      when the geometry of the rendered objects are freeform                          surfaces rather than polygonal objects.  The major problems                     with the Monte Carlo methods are the noisy characteristic of                    the solution and the high sample rate required to bring the                     noise down to an acceptable level.  Importance sampling and                     stratified sampling are two methods that can significantly                      reduce the noise level and sample rate required for a high                      quality solution.  Radiosity methods can be used to provide                     guidance for importance sampling.  Model preprocessing can be                   used to locate known discontinuity curves on the model                          surfaces and to partition the surfaces into pieces that are                     expected to have smooth illumination for stratification.                        Trimmed spline representations can be used to represent the                     illumination functions over each surface.",
