 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cores drilled into the central peak region of the K-T                      boundary-age Manson impact structure have encountered three major               impact breccias.  The shallowest is a sedimentary clast breccia                 with rare crystalline, melted or shocked clasts.  This is underlain             by a crystalline clast breccia with a glassy matrix followed by a               crystalline clast breccia with a sandy matrix.  Shock-metamorphosed             and shock-melted materials are common in both crystalline breccias.             This study will investigate the petrology of these  breccias and                related breccias encountered by new drilling, and will develop                  models for their emplacement and subsequent deformation.  It will               be conducted by University of Iowa personnel in conjunction with                the Iowa Department of Natural Resources-Geological Survey Bureau               (IDNR-GSB).  This study promises to enhance understanding of                    cratering processes at the Manson site as well as provide                       information about the nature of ejecta that may have been                       incorporated into K-T boundary sediments worldwide.  Thin-sections              used in this study will be cut from core allocated to the IDNR-                 GBS and petrographically examined to determine clast types, sizes,              and shapes as well as the nature of matrix materials.  Optically                obscure clasts and matrix materials will be identified using SEM-               EDS and XRD techniques.  Changes in clast and matrix abundances                 with depth will be quantified by point-counting.  Electron                      microprobe analysis will be used to characterize changes in mineral             and glass phase compositions with depth.  These data will be                    stored, manipulated and graphically displayed using standard soft-              ware running on IBM-PD2 computers.  It will be made available to                other Manson researchers when it is compiled.",
