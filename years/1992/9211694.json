 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering colleges have developed a wide range of individual                  education and research exchange programs with institutions in                   Germany, some with support through such organizations as the von                Humboldt Foundation and the DAAD, many with State support.                      There is a need to assess the status of the cooperative                         programs between U.S. and German institutions so that                           successful experiences and procedures can be shared.  It is                     with these developments in mind that a workshop assessing the                   overall impact of U.S.-German cooperative programs in                           Mechanical Engineering is supported.                                                                                                                            There are multiple objectives for the workshop, including: (1)                  an evaluation of existing U.S./Germany cooperative programs in                  Mechanical Engineering; (2) an assessment of problems                           associated with developing a cooperative program; (3) the                       development of guidelines/procedures of the initiation of                       U.S./Germany cooperative programs, (4) the establishment of                     goals for increasing the number of cooperative programs with                    Germany; and, (5) the development of recommendations for the                    role that NSF could play in advancing international                             cooperation in Mechanical Engineering.  Based on the                            evaluation of existing programs and associated problems, goals                  will be established for increasing the number of U.S./Germany                   cooperative programs and recommendations will be offered for                    the role that the USA may play in advancing international                       cooperation with Germany.  A workshop report will be prepared.",
