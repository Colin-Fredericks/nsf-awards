 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bottlenosed dolphins have a highly efficient echolocation sense,                enabling them to examine their physical world through sound.  By                emitting short-duration pulsed sounds and listening to the echoes               received, dolphins are able to detect and identify objects.                     Because people lack this sense, it is difficult for us to                       appreciate the types of mental images or representations of                     objects that may be formed through echolocation.  Dolphins also                 possess an efficient visual sense that is useful both underwater                and in air.  Are the images or representations formed through                   echolocation similar to those formed through vision?  Can a                     dolphin recognize through echolocation an object it has inspected               previously only through vision?  Conversely, can it recognize                   through vision an object it has inspected previously only through               echolocation?  These and related questions are addressed in a set               of experimental studies with dolphins at the Kawalo Basin Marine                Mammal Laboratory of the University of Hawaii.  By examining the                types or attributes of objects that may be recognized across the                two senses, the researchers will begin to develop ideas about                   what a dolphin \"sees\" with its echolocation sense.  More                        fundamentally, the research will also provide information on the                theoretical question of the degree to which information from                    different senses is integrated centrally--what may be called the                issue of the unity versus the independence of the senses.  Some                 degree of unity is seen in studies with humans and nonhuman                     primates of the relationships between vision and active touch.                  Does a similar degree of sensory unity occur in the dolphin, a                  nonprimate mammal with many demonstrated intellectual                           capabilities paralleling those found for nonhuman primates?  What               might such ability in a dolphin add to ideas about the convergent               evolution of intelligence in cetacean and primate brains, which                 have traced different paths for some 20 million years?  On an                   applied level, might the description of echoic \"visualization\" by               a dolphin offer fresh insights into the construction of                         intelligent sonar apparatus?",
