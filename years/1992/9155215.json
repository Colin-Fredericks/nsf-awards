 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Robert Howard is the Chairman of the Chemistry                              Department of the University of Tulsa, and an active                            proponent of high quality science instruction in elementary                     schools.  Dr. Howard has organized and conducted several                        teacher enhancement workshops for elementary teachers from                      the region adjacent to Tulsa, and he has planned a                              three-year series of workshops for elementary teachers                          across the entire state of Oklahoma. Underprepared teachers                     will be offered a five-week workshop experience, during                         which they will be exposed to exemplary instructional                           materials and the most current approaches to inquiry-based                      teaching methods.  The teachers will develop their own                          lesson plans based on these proven instructional materials,                     and will conduct classes for children in a practicum                            setting.  The following summer these same teachers will have                    a more advanced five-week workshop that will prepare them to                    act as lead teachers in their home school districts.                                                                                                            The proposed workshops will create a cadre of 150 trained                       leader teachers across Oklahoma.  Each of these teachers                        will be capable of catalyzing change in their own schools                       and school districts. The use of teachers as trainers and                       mentors of other teachers is a highly effective means of                        effecting broadly-based improvements in science instruction.                                                                                                    The cost sharing by the host institution amounts to 127% of                     the NSF support.",
