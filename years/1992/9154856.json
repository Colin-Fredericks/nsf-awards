 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Museum of Science and Industry seeks to facilitate the                      establishment of a network of Independent science clubs.                        Located in Chicago's south side, the Museum operates an in-house                science club which has over many years developed a large                        investory of activities.  The members themselves, drawn from a                  broad socio-economic base, have contributed much of the content                 and character of this hands-on program.  Now, in response to                    chicago's pressing local need for strong equity programming in                  science and technology education, the Museum proposes to                        \"package\" this club such that local chapters can readily be sent                up throughout the city land region, especially in community                     centers, churches and Park District recreation centers.                                                                                                         The club \"package\" will include:  Modules of learning activities                for various ages with supporting materials and equipment;                       Museum-coordinated trips to research and industrial sites;                      gatherings at the Museum; training of club facilitators; and                    adaptable organization format with an accounting system;                        recruitment of volunteers as helpers and role models;                           substantial help with fund-raising.  NSF support is sought for                  the establishment of the modules and system, and the Museum                     commits itself to on-going maintenance and coordination of the                  network.                                                                                                                                                        The Science Club Network will draw extensively on existing                      programs, community networks and support systems.  The Museum                   has already elicited many commitments of financial and other                    support for local chapters.",
