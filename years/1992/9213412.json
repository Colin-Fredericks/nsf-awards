 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Minority Career Advancement Award provides funds for a                study of the structural conditions of communities that contribute               to youth behaviors such as dropping out of high school,                         delinquency, and teenage pregnancy.  The study will focus on two                cities (Detroit, MI and Phoenix, AR) with high levels of poverty                and residential segregation but with distinctive ethnic                         composition and socioeconomic environments.  Neighborhood                       demographic and organizational variables from the US census                     combined with information from local schools, juvenile courts,                  and health departments will form the data for the study.                             This study will contribute to our understanding of how                     community characteristics may contribute to the reproduction of                 the underclass.  The Minority Career Advancement Award will also                permit the investigator to expand her research in new directions,               and it will provide opportunities for several minority doctoral                 students to participate in the research process.",
