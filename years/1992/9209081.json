 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory                               Research is to improve and generalize the present                               characterization and description of laser beam                                  properties or laser beam figures of merit to cover a                            broader range of laser beams and pulses, and to                                 describe their propagation through ideal and real                               optical systems.  The new point of view is to use the                           phase-space approach for describing the beam                                    completely in both space and time, and to derive                                important figures of merit for the beam from this                               phase-space description.  This language relates                                 different characteristics to each other, leading to a                           few overall measurable quantities for characterizing                            even a pulsed beam.  It follows that a description of                           the laser beams and pulses in phase-space will                                  provide new, more general overall information.  The                             experimental objective is to design and develop a                               device for measuring the overall laser beam                                     characteristics in a new fashion by providing direct                            access to phase-space characteristics, using suitable                           optical transforms and digital acquisition of phase-                            space information.  Such a device would present more                            complete information about either a pulsed or cw                                laser beam.  The main significance of the project is                            that:  it will provide a better description than                                presently available for laser beams, laser pulses and                           their propagation; it will generalize to beams with                             lower symmetry and also to pulsed laser beams the                               existing results for cw symmetric beams; and it will                            provide an experimental set-up for measuring the                                beam factors of merit directly in phase-space terms.",
