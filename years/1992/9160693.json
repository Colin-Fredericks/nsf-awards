 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will develop a new analytical tool and                             technique permitting in-situ analysis of dissolved metals                       in ground water.  The project consists of realizing the                         analysis of dissolved metals by applying the well known                         principles of polarography in a novel manner.  The details                      of this new analytical technology are presented and                             described in the proprietary section.  \u0131PS-1!.  The program                     will perform better than standard available electrochemical                     techniques for the in-situ analysis of dissolved metals for                     the following reasons: (1) problems associated with                             electrode poisoning are prevented by first exhausting the                       electrodes poisons from the water to be analyzed; (2) most                      between species interactions and interferences at the                           surface of the working electrodes are suppressed; (3) many                      of the constraints encountered using classical                                  polarographic techniques are suppressed; (4) low detection                      levels are achieved; (5) better separation of                                   electroplatable species.                                                                                                                                        The small size will permit deployment of the devices                            directly as in-situ sensors supported by most available                         commercial probes capable of housing a device a few                             centimeters in size.  The use of microfabrication for the                       production of the sensors will provide new sophisticated                        analytical devices at low cost per unit.",
