 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work addresses a long-standing problem in using large water                samplers at sea where the terminal velocity of the sampler sinking              through the water column is less than the wire to which it is                   attached.  Without careful management and complex motion                        compensation devices, data can be degraded, and excessive snap                  loads can develop causing the cable to break.  This project will                involve mechanical design, prototype construction and testing of a              water sampler attachment mechanism that will decouple the                       underwater instrument package from its wire during descent.  The                sampler will be allowed to free-fall at its natural, and constant               terminal velocity, independent of the hydrographic wire's ship-                 induced movement.  Once at full depth, a mechanical device will                 firmly couple the instrument package to the wire for retrieval back             to the surface.  A constant and predicable descent rate through the             water column will improve the quality of oceanographic data and                 lessen the chance of losing instruments from cable management                   problems.  This work has a direct bearing and use on several global             geoscience research initiatives.",
