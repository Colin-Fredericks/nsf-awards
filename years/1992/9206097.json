 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication between cellular compartments frequently occurs by             shuttle vesicles.  The unique features of the endosomal system of               Paramecium will be explored by the use of monoclonal antibodies,                confocal fluorescence microscopy, replicas of quick-freeze freeze-              dried cell fragments, immunogold labeling of cryosections and                   Lowicryl sections, and high resolution scanning electron microscopy             of isolated organelles.  The course of probes will be followed from             coated pits to early endosomes and on to the next compartment,                  which may or many not be the acidosomes.  Initial studies indicate              that this latter transport is via 90 nm clathrin-coated shuttle                 vesicles arising from early endosomes.  Selective labeling, antigen             blocking and trypsinization techniques in conjunction with a                    monoclonal antibody will be used to follow the reappearance on the              cell surface of a plasma membrane resident antigen, C6, which                   enters the early endosome compartment from coated pits via 190 nm               preendosomal vesicles but does not enter the 90 nm early endosome-              derived shuttle vesicles.  Another mAb, specific for acidosomes,                will be used to study the biogenesis of the acidosomal membranes                and their relationship to the endosomal or contractile vacuole                  systems.  Finally, quick-freeze, freeze-dry techniques and high                 resolution scanning electron microscopy will be used to visualize               and study the true cytosolic surfaces of membranes associated with              the endosomal, phagosome-lysosome, and contractile vacuole systems              of this cell.                                                                   %%%                                                                             Virtually all eukaryotic cells contain an internal membrane system              which creates a series of functionally and biochemically distinct               intracellular compartments isolated from the \"cytoplasm\" by their               membrane boundaries.  Although these compartments are functionally              and biochemically distinct, it is known that they \"communicate\"                 with and exchange contents with each other and with the                         extracellular space (isolated from the cytoplasm by the cell's                  plasma membrane) either directly or indirectly via membrane fusion              events.  This internal membrane system is the route by which cells              take up materials from their environment and process them                       enzymatically, as well as secrete products to the environment.                  Understanding how this system functions, and how it is regulated,               is a major goal in cell biology.  In this project, the single-                  celled freeliving organism, Paramecium, is used as a readily                    manipulable model to study how cells communicate between selected               compartments, how they package and return resident proteins to                  their home compartment or membrane, and how the topography of their             true cytosolic membrane surface is related to the compartment's                 function.",
