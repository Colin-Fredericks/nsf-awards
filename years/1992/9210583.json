 "awd_abstract_narration": "The key to the success in using a distributed system for                   hard real-time applications is the timely execution of                          computation tasks which usually reside on different nodes and                   communicate with one another to accomplish a common goal.                       End-to-end deadline guarantees are not possible without a                       communication network which supports the timely delivery of                     intertask messages. The main focus of the research is to address                issues related to guaranteeing synchronous message deadlines,                   i.e., no matter what happens (except a network  failure), the                   messages will be transmitted before their deadlines.  We have                   selected FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) networks for                   this study because they are well suited for hard real-time                      communications, due not only to their high bandwidth, but also to               their property of bounded token rotation time.  However, a                      bounded token rotation time alone is not sufficient to guarantee                hard  real-time deadlines. Synchronous capacity allocation is                   equally critical in achieving this performance objective.  In                   this project, we concentrate on design and analysis of                          synchronous capacity allocation to guarantee message deadlines.                 The project consists of four related tasks: We  first address                   the issue of optimality. An optimal scheme  achieves the highest                worst case utilization and hence offers the best chance to                      guarantee a set of synchronous messages. Then, we  study                        localized allocation schemes which use local information to                     allocate synchronous capacity to a node.  They have the advantage               of being able to adjust the parameters on one node without                      disturbing the operations of others.  Next, we will extend our                  basic model to consider variations needed in practice.  For                     example, some applications do not require an absolute deadline                  guarantee, i.e., occasionally  missing a deadline is acceptable.                We formalize these ideas in the design and analysis of                          allocations schemes in order to improve their applicability.                    Selection of TTRT (Target Token Rotation Time) also affects                     the chance of guaranteeing deadlines; this is addressed as the                  last task in the project.",
