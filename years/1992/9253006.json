 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept proposed for this research program is based on combining            advanced immunoassay strategies for microorganism recognition with              capable vapor sensors for on-line feedback in wastewater                        chlorination.  the antibody-antigen step will be configured to yield            simultaneously vapors specific to certain pathogens and will likely             involve multiple antibody-enzyme-substrate-vapor combinations.  The             sensor will be an ion mobility spectrometer which has been altered              chemically in the ion source to produce favorable response to target            vapors and diminished sensitivity to potential interferences.  This             combination of antigen-antibody recognition will be a basis for high            selectively and the ion mobility spectrometer will provide ultra-low            detection limits and fast response.                                                                                                                             The combination of immunoassay with vapor sensors is intended for               domestic fixed point monitoring in domestic water treatment plants.             The feedback loop is intended to allow a rational and informed                  control over chlorination.  Such enhanced control will permit a                 balance between over-chlorination (chemical pollution) and under                chlorination (biological pollution) in wastewater treatment plants              initially.  However, with minor changes in inlets and small                     modifications in procedures (mostly sample handling), in-field rapid            bacteria assays could be developed and used nationally and in                   developing nations where water borne pathogens constitute daily                 threats to public health.  The core science and engineering is much             the same and both uses will be pursued although priority will be                given to water and wastewater treatment plants.",
