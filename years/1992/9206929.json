 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cohomological physics refers to that part of physics,                      primarily gauge and field theories, in which a variety of                       cohomological techniques are seeing increasing application.  The                instant project is concerned with application of techniques                     developed in the investigator's previous study of classifying                   spaces and rational homotopy theory as an algebraic topologist.  It             is particularly directed to four classes of problems:  (1) homotopy             associative differential graded algebras and Lie analogs,                       especially as they occur in string field theories and spin n-                   algebras;  (2) quasi-Hopf algebras and deformations of bialgebras;              (3) Zamolodcdhikov's tetrahedral equation and generalized                       classifying spaces;  (4) the homological aspects of reduction of                constrained Hamiltonian systems, both classical and quantum, as                 embodied in the BRST formalism and the Batalia-Fradkin-Vilkovisky               complex and its generalizations.  (1) and (2) bear a very strong                resemblance; one major thrust of this research being to understand              the underlying reason for this resemblance.  (3) involves \"higher               dimensional algebra,\" which is the analog of the algebra in (1) and             (2) but beginning with structures for which one-dimensional                     diagrams are inadequate.  Although defined in greater and more                  abstract generality, such structures as occur in mathematical                   physics are the focus of this work.                                                  In another context, a noted mathematical physicist has                     marveled at the \"unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.\"  This              project is devoted to a special case of that observation, namely,               the unreasonable effectiveness of algebraic topology.  It begins                with the discovery that a paper the investigator published almost               thirty year ago as an algebraic topologist was slated for a key                 role in conformal string theory and related matters.  The \"higher               order associativity\" of H-spaces that he developed there has gone               through a sequence of developments at the hands of MacLane;                     Brustein, Ne'eman, and Sternberg; Joyal and Street; and finally                 Drinfeld, who, in 1989, gave deep and ingenious applications to                 both physics and low dimensional topology.  Stasheff has become an              enthusiastic participant in the ensuing explosion of interest in                this and related areas.",
