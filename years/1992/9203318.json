The                  program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and                        experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a five-month postdoctoral research visit by             Dr. William G. Lawrence of the University of California, Irvine                 with Professor N. Schwentner of the Freie Universitat Berlin.  The              researchers will focus on the study of the photodissociation                    dynamics of HF and F2 in argon and neon matrices.                                                                                                               The photodissociation of halogens and halogen halides in rare gas               solids presents one of the simplest systems for studying molecular              dynamics in condensed phase.  Using vacuum ultraviolet radiation                from the Berlin Synchrotron facility BESSY, they propose to study               the photodissociation dynamics of HF and F2 in argon and neon                   matrices.  The synchrotron source can be used for dissociation of               F2 and HF and also for detection of H and F atoms using photo-                  induced charge transfer emmision.  Using this technique, the                    mobility of F and H atoms after photodissociation will be                       measured.  These studies will also include spectroscopy of the NeF              excimer in solid neon, and an evaluation of the ArF excimer in                  neon as a solid sate excimer laser medium.                                                                                                                      This award recommendation provides funds to cover international                 travel and a stipend for five months.",
