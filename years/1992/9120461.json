 "awd_abstract_narration": "New Zealand's recent movement toward liberalization of all                      economic activity provides a unique case study opportunity to                   both observe and evaluate the effects of deregulation on the                    agricultural section of the New Zealand economy.  This                          cooperative research award supports visits over a two year period               by Dr. Warren Johnston of the University of California at Davis                 to work with Dr. Gerald Frengley and colleagues at Lincoln                      University in Canterbury, New Zealand.  The research focuses on                 the impact of deregulation on adjustment of farm firms to changes               in input, commodity and capital markets.  Emphasis will be on                   changes in financial conditions and differential abilities of                   farm firms with respect to survival.  Analysis includes financial               and efficiency assessments, and is extended to include                          consequences for family farm households incorporating                           expectations and financial stress.  The research results should                 be of interest to agricultural economists, policy makers and to                 farmers not only in New Zealand but also should have important                  implications for agriculture in North American and Eastern and                  Western Europe.",
