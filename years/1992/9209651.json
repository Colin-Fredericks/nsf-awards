 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to correctly perceive the physical world around us is               to a large part dependent on hooking the eye up to the brain in a               very precise fashion.  Dr. Debski's goal is to understand the                   process whereby the neurons from the eye choose the cells in a                  target structure with which to connect.  In order to study the                  problem of how the eye connects to the brain, Dr. Debski will use               the visual system of a amphibian model system.  In this system, the             eye connects to the optic tectum, the main visual area of the                   animal.  There the neurons from the eye form a map of the visual                space.  This brain structure is similar to the visual maps found                in mammals and primates.  One of the distinct advantages of the                 amphibian is that development of the visual system occurs during                a stage when it is readily accessible.  Therefore the developmental             processes which lead to the formation of these maps can be studied.             Dr. Debski's study will focus on the NMDA receptor, a type of                   receptor found on some neurons.  This receptor is known to play as              role in determining where the optic tectum neurons from the eye                 connect.  She will determine whether the activity of this receptor              can be modulated by the neurotransmitters glycine, serotonin and                VIP and to what extent the latter two of these transmitters are                 found in the visual system and therefore are likely to provide such             modulation in the intact animal.  Dr. Debski will also determine                the degree to which the developing system changes with respect to               NMDA receptor activity and serotonin- and VIP-like immunoreactive               neurons as it matures.  The results from these studies will allow               us to better understand how to modulate NMDA receptor activity as               a means to correct error in visual connectivity when they occur.***//",
