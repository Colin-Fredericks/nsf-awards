 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year grant for the renewal of regional                     undergraduate participation in ongoing research programs in the                 Department of Physics, Florida State University.                                Applications for ten Summer Junior Fellowship positions are                     solicited from 160 colleges and universities throughout the                     southeastern region of the United States.  Applicants'                          interests are matched with the research programs and extra                      attention is given to applications from women and minorities.                   The main focus of the program is to provide research                            experience for undergraduate physics majors in the southeast                    region, with usually 9 out of 10 fellowships going to students                  outside of FSU.  The laboratories include a S-FN Tandem Van de                  Graaff, a superconducting LINAC, four smaller accelerators                      used for environmental and implantation studies, and a                          particle physics detector laboratory as well as active                          programs at Brookhaven, Fermilab and CERN, an ultra-high                        resolution infrared spectrometer, a helium atom scattering                      spectrometer, a liquid crystal laboratory, and a number of low                  temperature solid state research facilities.  Approximately 15 to               20 faculty members will be directly involved with Summer Junior                 Fellows.  In addition to joint research activities, all Fellows                 will attend a seminar designed for the program and                              will present papers and talks on their summer research near the                 end of the appointment.  Each summer two or three of the Fellows                will work with the host group (nuclear physics), with the seminar               series, short courses in computer programming and machine shop                  techniques, and the student talks providing the common links                    between the different areas of physics.",
