 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is the development of a new                       method based on carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance chemical                   shifts for determining thermodynamic acidity functions for                      liquid and solid acids.  Medium effects are eliminated by                       using the difference in chemical shift between two carbon                       atoms in the same molecule as the measurement parameter.  The                   new method is applicable to systems lacking the transparency                    to visible and ultraviolet light required for use of                            traditional Hammett indicators, and is extendable to solids.                    To relate solid acidity to solution acidity, the protonation                    equilibrium of indicator bases in solution is studied at the                    stoichiometric acid-to-base ratio and the same indicator bases                  are then studied on solid acids at equimolar ratios of base to                  acid sites.  Finally, the effects of solvents on acid                           strengths is examined.                                                                                                                                          Although the concept of acidity is often used to interpret the                  effects of solid catalysts, there is, in fact, no sound                         technique to measure or quantify this property for solids.                      This project addresses this problem directly; success would                     provide a more rational framework for understanding of many                     catalytic systems, and also of corrosion, composite stability,                  and chromophoric displays.",
