 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to  determine the differential                effects of the evolutionary forces of drift and migration on                    patterns of biological variation in Ireland resulting from                      demographic shifts following the Great Famine of the 1840s.  This               project will provide insight into human evolution and variation                 from a unique perspective afforded by several generations of                    data.  This project will also provide general information on the                effects of changes in population size and migration on human                    genetic variation.                                                                                                                                              Physical anthropologists are interested in the relationship of                  evolutionary process with cultural and demographic changes.  The                Irish Famine of the 1840s resulted in major demographic shifts,                 including a rapid reduction in population size that persisted                   through the early 20th century and an increase in migration                     between depopulated regions.  These rapid changes could increase                genetic differentiation through drift (random genetic change) or                decrease it through migration (gene flow).  The opposing forces                 of drift and gene flow have been studied in numerous human                      populations to date, but almost always at one point in time.                    Using extensive physical and demographic data from Ireland                      (originally collected in a survey during the 1930s), the PI will                be able to examine these changes over at least three generations                of people born after the Famine.                                                                                                                                The results from this study will provide a unique perspective on                the process of human microevolution by examining genetic changes                over several generations (such data are rare in human studies).",
