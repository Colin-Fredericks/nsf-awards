 "awd_abstract_narration": "The contractor for this project will conduct two surveys for               the National Science Foundation (NSF).  The Survey of Federal                   Funds for Research and Development (R&D) provides detailed annual               time series data on all federal R&D funding; and the Survey of                  Federal Support to Universities, Colleges, and Selected Nonprofit               Institutions provides detailed annual time series data on federal               R&D and science and engineering (S&E) obligations to individual                 institutions of higher education, nonprofit institutions, and                   federally funded research and development centers.  The work will               include development and implementation of a new, integrated,                    state-of-the-art software system; data processing services; and                 technical support for statistical information collected with                    these two surveys.  The contractor will be responsible for                      creating and mailing the survey instruments, processing and                     editing the data, and generating final data tabulations in the                  form of camera-ready detailed statistical tables.  The contractor               shall also provide additional technical support and respond to ad               hoc requests, as required by NSF.                                                    The two surveys are conducted to fulfill legislative                       mandates that require NSF to collect and disseminate data on                    federal R&D and S&E activities.  The availability of timely                     statistics depends on an effective data processing system.  Data                collected with these surveys are used by individuals in both the                public and private sectors to address key questions on Federal                  R&D funding levels and activities.",
