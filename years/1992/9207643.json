 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Sarah Neusius and                 her colleagues will continue their archaeological excavations at                the Ripley Site which is located in Chautauqua County, N.Y.                     Previous excavation by both Dr. Neusius and earlier investigators               has confirmed the presence of a large earthwork or surrounding                  wall and rich deposits of cultural materials within.  Dating of                 the site is uncertain and occupation may range from between the                 thirteenth century A.D. to historic times. Seven weeks of                       excavation are planned.  The site will first be plowed and disced               to reveal the distribution of cultural materials.  An intensive                 systematic surface pickup will then be conducted.  The material                 will be plotted and on the basis of the results two types of                    excavation will be undertaken.  Hand excavation will be conducted               in a midden area to recover indentifable faunal and floral                      remains as well as carbon samples for radiocarbon dating.                       Secondly mechanical stripping of the plow zone will be undertaken               in selected portions of the site.  Features exposed will then be                excavated by hand. Fieldwork will be followed by analysis to                    accomplish five goals: 1. reconstruction of site plan; 2.                       analysis of representative and provenienced assemblages for                     different material classes; 3. interpretation of features,                      structures and activity areas; 4. documentation of occupational                 history; 5. reconstruction of subsistence strategies and                        seasonality.                                                                                                                                                    Many archaeologists have focussed on the effects of contact                     between native Americans and early colonial settlers.  Through                  cases of such culture contact, underlying processes of                          interaction and culture change can be discerned.  Particular                    attention has focussed on the Northeastern United States because                in this region the Iroquois confederacy had achieved a level of                 political organization rare in chiefly societies.  This is also a               region with good historic documentation.  However for such work                 to succeed it is necessary to have good baseline information                    about both precontact and early contact periods.  Many earth                    circles have been found in the Northeast yet their function is                  unknown.  Some archaeologists have argued that they surrounded                  and served to protect villages while others have maintained that                they relate not to occupation sites but rather ceremonial                       centers.  The answer to this question is important because it                   affects understanding of both population density and                            social/political organization.  Dr. Neusius research at the                     Ripley site will address this issue.                                                                                                                            This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed new               light on America's unwritten past and increase our understanding                of the process of culture contact and culture change.  The grant                will also provide support to an undergraduate teaching                          institution and serve both to enhance the level of teaching and                 training for students.",
