 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator, in collaboration with Richard Pollack                    (Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University),              plans to continue his investigation of the interplay between the                geometry and the topology of Euclidean spaces by extending recent               results on the classification of ordered configurations and their               generalizations, and on related geometric and combinatorial                     problems.  Building on their past work on allowable sequences and               order types of configurations, as well as on ideas coming out of                their recent proof of the Grunbaum conjecture on the extendibility              of finite arrangements of topological lines to continuous spreads,              Goodman and Pollack plan to continue their work on configurations,              arrangements of topological flats, and geometric transversal                    theory, examining (among other problems) (1) the problem of                     generalizing the proof of the Grunbaum conjecture to intermediate-              dimensional flats, (2) the problem of finding a compact                         representation for configurations and polytopes, as well as a                   classification of arrangements of intermediate-dimensional flats                which reflects their geometric properties, and (3) the problem of               determining the relative frequency of order types (the classical                Sylvester problem, generalized) via the identification of the set               of simple n-point configurations in real d-dimensional space with               an open dense subset of a suitable Grassmann manifold.                               The advent of high-speed computing has brought new life to                 many of these questions over the past few decades, since it has                 become possible to investigate non-trivial examples relatively                  painlessly.  The size of interesting finite geometric sets tends to             increase exponentially with the dimension.  Consider, for the                   simplest example, the number of vertices of, in turn, a line                    segment, a square, a cube, a tesseract (4-dimensional), and so                  forth.  The corresponding numbers are 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., and the                 regularity here is so pronounced that the numbers are computable                and the properties of n-dimensional cubes, as they are called,                  remain manageable even for large n.  However, less regular sets                 with rapidly increasing size become much more difficult to handle               without a machine's assistance for computation.  This is one aspect             of the relation of this kind of mathematics to computing, but there             is another reciprocal relation.  Just as computing facilitates                  plausible conjecture and hence proof, so too do some of the proofs              lead to improved algorithms for computing.  We have here a very                 useful symbiosis that is bound to flourish even more in the years               to come.",
