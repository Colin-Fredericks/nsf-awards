 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific community is challenged by the need to reach                     out to students who have traditionally not been attracted to                    engineering and the sciences.  This project would provide a                     link between the University of Michigan and the teachers and                    students of secondary education in the State of Michigan                        with an initial emphasis on southeast Michigan, through the                     creation of a range of computer services which will provide                     interactive access to current weather and climate change                        information.  Taking advantage of a unique computer network                     capacity within the State of Michigan named MichNet which                       provides local phone ports in virtually every major city in                     the state, and the resources available to the university                        community via the University Corporation for Atmospheric                        Research (UCAR) UNIDATA program, this project would provide                     secondary schools with access to a state-of-the-art                             interactive weather information system.  The real-time data                     available via the system, supplemented by interactive                           computer modules designed in collaboration with earth                           science teachers, will provide animated background                              information on a range of climate and weather related                           topics.  While the principal objective of this project will                     be to provide educationally stimulating interactive computer                    systems and electronic weather and climate modules for                          application in inner city Detroit and its environs, the                         unique nature of the available computer networking will                         allow virtually every school system in the state to have                        access.  Subsequently successful completion of this project                     could eventually make the same systems available to other                       cities and states.",
