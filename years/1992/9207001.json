Project funding will enable Dr. Mustafa Keskin                                  of Erciyes University to spend two months                                       in the laboratory of Dr. Paul Meijer at                                         Catholic University.  Additionally, Dr. Meijer                                  will travel to Kayseri and spend three                                          weeks in Dr. Keskin's laboratory.  This                                         cooperative research project will elucidate                                     global features of binary fluid critical                                        phase line behavior in relation to classes of                                   equations of state and parameter ranges.  This                                  project is useful from the standpoint of                                        providing an overall perspective on phase                                       behavior and strategies for representing or                                     interpreting it in terms of categories of                                       equations of state.
