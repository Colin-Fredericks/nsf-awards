 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the role of active oxygen in                      restricting pathogenesis by the plant pathogenic bacterium                      Pseudomonas syringae.  The hypothesis that the pathogenic                       Pseudomonads are able to reduce plant-imposed oxidative stress                  during pathogenesis though an arsenal of catalase isozymes will be              tested.  There are two portions to the project: 1) cloning of the               genes for the catalase isozymes and construction of mutants for                 virulence studies; and 2) determination of the interactions of the              various catalase genes with the hrp genes that appear to control                the pathogenicity of the bacterium.  The genetic part will be                   carried out by Dr. Hutcheson at the University of Maryland, while               biochemical and physiological studies will be carried out by Dr.                Klotz at Utah State University under another award.                             %%%                                                                             This research will contribute to the understanding of the initial               events that occur during plant-microbe interactions, and should                 provide new information on the fundamental differences between                  microbes that causes plant disease and those which cannot.",
