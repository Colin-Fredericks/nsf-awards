 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sliding charge density waves and flux lattices in superconductors               exhibit unusual transport properties due to cooperative phenomena               and quenched impurities.  In the past these systems were studied                using mean field theory and small scale simulations on sequential               computers.  These simulations provided good qualitative results and             insight, but failed to provide quantitative answers.                                                                                                            Recently large scale simulations on parallel computers, such as                 those carried out by the principal investigators of this grant and              their collaborators, have begun to yield new quantitative results               in this field.  Motivated by these advances, parallel architectures             will be exploited in this grant for an extensive study of the                   collective dynamics of charge density waves and flux lattices.  In              their simplest version, the numerical models for these systems are              well suited for parallel machines.  Our research emphasizes the                 search for new algorithms for an efficient parallelization and the              use of visualization techniques.  The second stage of our research              will focus on strongly disordered elastic media, where dislocations             can tear the lattice, and Multiple Instruction Multiple Data                    architecture will be more suited for numerical studies.  The                    dynamics of strongly disordered elastic media is both a problem of              great theoretical interest in condensed matter physics and a                    testing ground for developing new algorithms for a Multiple                     Instruction Multiple Data environment.                                                                                                                          This research is funded jointly by the Materials Theory program in              the Division of Materials Research and the New Technologies program             in the Division of Advanced Scientific Computing.  The grant is                 funded through the Computational Approaches to Real Materials                   program which is under the High Performance Computing and                       Communication Initiative.                                                       %%%                                                                             This theoretical and computational research will focus on two                   problems that share common computational requirements.  One problem             deals with the movement of electric charge in solids due to wave                motion, while the other deals with high temperature                             superconductors.  The research is of fundamental interest to the                materials research community and also has potential to impact                   industrial applications.  What makes this research program unique               is the use of new massively parallel computers to deal with these               problems for the first time.  This raises the possibility for                   significant breakthroughs, in addition to the development of new                algorithms for similar problems in other areas of computing.",
