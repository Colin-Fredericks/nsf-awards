 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a joint seminar proposed by Dr. Jackson Yang, the                       University of Maryland, and Professor Yung-Chun Wu, National                    Chiao Tung University supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA                       (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This seminar will focus on               the issue of automation and productivity for small and medium                   scale manufacturing industries.   Advanced manufacturing                        processes is an important topic for both the U.S. and Taiwan.                   Automation has not been extensively incorporated in the small and               medium-sized manufacturing industries in the U.S.  Taiwan, on the               other hand, has been successful in incorporating such processes                 in its manufacturing process.  A workshop on this topic can                     benefit the scientists and the manufacturing industry in both the               U.S. and Taiwan.  The issue is important and the knowledge                      derived from this meeting can be useful in terms of future U.S.                 industrial competitiveness. The Materials Processing and                        Manufacturing Program and the Industrial Centers Division have                  each contributed $2,500 in joint funding for this workshop.",
