 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concrete complexity behavior of some NP-hard discrete                  optimization problems will be investigated, with instances                      restricted to graphs having tree-representable structure (for                   instance, k-trees, series-parallel graphs, or interval                          graphs.)   A major tool in this research is the concept of                      treewidth of graphs.  Families of graphs with bounded                           treewidth admit a special type of non-serial dynamic                            programming approach leading to algorithms efficiently solving                  many difficult discrete optimization problems.                                       The work of Robertson and Seymour on well-quasi orderings                  of graphs implies existence of low-order polynomial time                        solution algorithms for many inherently difficult optimization                  problems, when instances are restricted to wide classes of                      graphs.  However, such algorithms suffer a double weakness:                     they require knowledge of a finite obstruction set, and the                     general design paradigm constructs algorithms that execute in                   polynomial time but with multiplicative constants of                            astronomic magnitude.                                                                The proposed research will deal with these deficiencies                    in two ways:  investigating means to construct obstruction                      sets for families of graphs with uniformly bounded treewidth                    and streamlining solution algorithms for particular discrete                    optimization problems, as the full generality of the algorithm                  design paradigm often is not necessary.",
