 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior research has examined applications that used shared                  memory in single site systems and their extension to operate in                 a distributed environment.  The approach was to modify the                      underlying operating system to support a new facility for memory                management called distributed shared memory (DSM).  This                        research will relax assumptions which characterized the system                  as having a \"tight\" degree of sharing among a small number of                   reliable, well-behaved, communicating sites.  This assumption                   may not be appropriate for a large scale, typical, distributed                  computing environment.  Reasonably common failure modes in some                 workstation environments include site failures and network                      partitions.  Prior work does not specifically address the issue                 of communication breakages nor site failures.  This project                     addresses a manageable subset of these issues.                                       Three issues are of concern for creating a reliable DSM                    system.  The first issue is to determine how sensible it is for                 DSM to accommodate reliability extensions and for which                         applications this support is appropriate.  The second issue is                  to design and implement changes to support reliability.  It is                  only through the design, implementation, and use of this                        facility that one can gain exposure to analyzable failure modes.                The third research issue involves a study of the performance of                 the reliability mechanism using a \"fault induction\" testing                     strategy.",
