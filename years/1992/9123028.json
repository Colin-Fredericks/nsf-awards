 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                 metallic Chemistry Program, will undertake the synthesis and                    characterization of new examples of carbon and nitrogen acids                   that have very high acidities as a result of substitution by                    perfluoroalkylsulfonyl groups.  The conjugate bases of these                    acids are predicted to be highly stable and to have very low                    nucleophilicities.  In a second area, metal salts of these                      strong acids, both monoprotic and polyprotic, will be prepared                  and their solid state structures determined by x-ray                            crystallography.  Preliminary studies indicate that such                        derivatives are likely to have layered or zeolitic structures                   with potentially useful applications.  Finally, in a                            continuation of earlier NSF-funded research, further studies of                 the fluorination of organic compounds by fluorobis(polyfluoro-                  alkylsulfonyl)amines will be undertaken along with efforts to                   develop larger scale syntheses of this class of compounds.                      %%%                                                                             The high electron withdrawing capability of fluorine as a                       substituent results in very unusual properties for its                          compounds.  At the same time introduction of fluorine into many                 compounds, and organic compounds in particular, is difficult                    because of the highly reactive nature of the element and many                   of the reagents used for this purpose.  This project will                       undertake further fundamental studies of the synthesis and                      properties of highly fluorinated materials.  Potential uses for                 the new compounds to be synthesized include ionic conductors,                   catalysts, and high temperature electrolytes.",
