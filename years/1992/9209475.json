 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most exciting recent advances in the field of behavioral             ecology is the application of molecular genetic techniques to answer            critical questions concerning relative reproductive success of                  various classes of individuals in populations.  Evolutionary                    interpretations of results of early studies have had to rely on                 various assumptions about mating patterns, some of which have                   subsequently been shown to be erroneous using these new techniques.                                                                                             I propose to learn to use these techniques (especially DNA                      fingerprinting) so that I may answer questions of paternity for                 studies on the behavioral ecology of lizards, a group of organisms              currently under-represented in the behavioral ecology literature yet            well-suited to such studies.  Reptiles are an important group to                include in comparative studies of the evolution of mating systems               and social behavior since they represent a bridge between the                   ectothermic vertebrates and the reproductively terrestrial                      vertebrates.  After learning these techniques at the Genetics                   Laboratory of the National Zoo, I plan to undertake a behavioral                study on alternative mating tactics, followed by paternity analysis.            The paternity analysis would take place in the common-use Laboratory            of Evolutionary and Ecological Genetics, currently under development            in Biology at NMSU, and would test my ability.",
