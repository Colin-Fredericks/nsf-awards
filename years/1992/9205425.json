 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to determine the role of the nuclear               protein encoded by the Drosophila suppressor of sable \u0131su(s)! gene              in RNA processing control.  Mutations of the su(s) gene elevate the             expression levels of three vermilion (v) mutants.  These v mutants              have insertions of a retrotransposon in the first exon of the v                 gene.  The transposon insertion in this position behaves as a large             intron and is spliced from the precursor RNA at cryptic sites near              the ends of transposon sequences.  Experimental observations                    indicate that su(s) mutations increase the stability of these                   transcripts.  Two models are being proposed to explain the                      observations.  First, RNA stability could be increased if su(s)                 mutations enhance spliceosome formation at cryptic sites, thereby               unspliced RNAs would be stabilized and allowed more time for                    splicing to occur.  Thus, su(s) might encode a component of the                 splicing machinery.  Alternatively, su(s) could encode a protein                involved in targeting nuclear RNAs for degradation, suggesting that             su(s) might play a direct role in controlling the stability of                  specific transcripts.  The objectives of this proposal are the                  following.  (1) To establish whether the response of v mutants to               su(s) mutations depends on splicing at the cryptic sites, these                 splice sites will be altered (e.g., eliminated and improved) by                 site specific mutagenesis.  After transformation of these                       derivatives into the Drosophila germ line, expression will be                   examined in su(s) wild type and mutant backgrounds.  (2) To develop             an in vitro assay for su(s) activity, nuclear extracts will be                  prepared from su(s) wild type and mutant embryos and tested by in               vitro splicing, spliceosome assembly, and RNA degradation assays.               (3) To examine the biochemical properties of the su(s) protein,                 anti-su(s) antibodies will be used to determine whether the protein             fractionates with spliceosomes or if it binds to RNA.                           Furthermore, attempts will be made to partially purify the protein              from either embryos or cultured cells that have been engineered to              over express the protein.                                                       %%%                                                                             These studies will provide new information about RNA processing                 control mechanisms in eukaryotes.",
