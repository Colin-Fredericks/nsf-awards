 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for high quality, directed research on hyperbase systems               (hypermedia database systems) has become very apparent to                       researchers in many fields.  This workshop brings together                      approximately 25 participants from the areas of hypermedia,                     database, collaborative and information retrieval systems for an                intensive two-day workshop, held in Washington, D.C. in October                 1992. The workshop has two primary goals.  The first goal is to                 bring synergy to the hyperbase system research area through                     understanding and building of research relationships in this                    diverse and multidisciplinary group.  The second goal is to                     establish an agenda for research in this critical area of next-                 generation information systems.  The result of the workshop is a                report identifying: critical research issues facing hyperbase                   system researchers, current progress on the issues, potential                   methods of approach (including literature citations) and a                      general research agenda for the field.  The results will be                     widely disseminated in the refereed and professional society                    literature and through the appropriate conferences.",
