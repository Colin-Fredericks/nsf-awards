 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate properties of complexity                         classes, both sequential and parallel, with a view to                           understand the structure of computations in these classes and                   the relationships among these classes.  The circuit model will                  be used to do these studies.  The Boolean circuit model is an                   appealing model for studying the structure of computations in                   complexity classes because it makes it simpler to use                           combinatorial and algebraic arguments.  The close connections                   between machine models such as Turing machines and Boolean                      circuits facilitates the application of techniques and results                  from circuit complexity theory to address questions from                        complexity theory.  The study of complexity classes defined by                  restricted models of computation such as monotone Boolean                       circuits, and the study of counting classes using the circuit                   framework are other developments that make the circuit model                    quite valuable.                                                                                                                                                 This research will study several issues in complexity theory                    with circuits as the unifying framework.  Specifically, the                     following are some topics that will be addressed by this work:                  semi-unbounded fan-in circuits as a model of computation,                       relationships between NP and other classes such as LOGCFL that                  are definable using the semi-unbounded fan-in circuit model,                    relationships among counting classes and their implications,                    properties of monotone complexity classes and relationships                     among them, and the dual interpreted pebble game model.  Many                   related issues will also be addressed in the course of this                     work.  It is expected that this research work will extend our                   understanding of the many fundamental problems of                               computational complexity theory leading to new insights into                    the difficulties involved in resolving them.",
