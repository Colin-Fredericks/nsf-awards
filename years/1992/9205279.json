 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study considers the impact of beaver on the behavior of the                element phosphorus in streams.  Historical records indicate that                beaver probably inhabited most of the small streams in North                    America prior to settlement by Europeans.  The river flow on these              streams was likely impeded by a series of beaver dams, resulting                in ponds separated by the stream channels.  Harvesting of beaver                led to their near extinction around 1900, but laws protecting them              have led to their rapid recovery.  It is therefore important to                 understand the influence of beaver on streams because their                     presence characterizes the past and perhaps future status of                    streams.  The influence of beaver activity on phosphorus dynamics               in streams has not been fully studied.  It is important that these              studies be done because phosphorus is an element which often                    limits the growth and metabolism of aquatic organisms.  If the                  concentration of this element in water is changed by the presence               of beaver dams, then downstream reaches will be altered.  This                  study will determine if beaver dams change the phosphorus                       concentration in downstream water and what factors (particularly                those associated with sediments) influence the behavior of                      phosphorus and its relation to decomposition processes.",
