 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator develops mathematical methods for analyzing               oscillatory networks of neurons.  Such networks are common in the               central nervous system, but so far the relationship between                     structure and function in them is largely unexplored.  Some of                  the specific projects are tightly connected to the analysis of                  particular neurophysiological networks, such as the vertebrate                  central pattern generator for undulatory locomotion.  This work                 is undertaken in collaboration with a group of                                  neurophysiologists. Others are designed to develop new methods to               analyze such networks.  In particular, neurons and networks of                  them operate on many different time scales, and new mathematical                techniques are needed to understand the range of behaviors that                 can result as a consequence.  The mathematics is used to help                   determine which features in the neurons or their connectivity is                responsible for the emergent behavior seen in physiological                     preparations or in computer simulations of them.  Mathematical                  techniques that have been useful for earlier stages of this work                include reduction procedures that produce simpler equations                     having similar behavior. New techniques to be developed include                 geometric methods for the analysis of equations with many time                  scales.  Some of the project topics concern the development of                  such techniques independent of biological questions.                                 Central pattern generators are neural networks -- clusters                 of neurons connected together -- that are thought to govern                     rhythmic motor activity such as walking, running, swimming, and                 breathing.  These generators are examples of oscillatory networks               of neurons.  The project aims to develop a better understanding                 of the relations between the structure of oscillatory networks                  and the behaviors of the networks.  Such understanding is                       fundamental for a variety of neurophysiological questions.",
