Experiments investigate potentially key roles of pioneer trees in                                                                                               recovery of Sabah Malaysia's tropical rain forests after                        selective logging.  In three post-logging disturbance regimes,                  seed addition experiments assess the extent to which pioneer                    patchiness after logging reflects seed availability versus site                 specificity of pioneers.  Other studies in recently logged areas                                                                                                address seasonality of seed delivery, impact of seed predators on                                                                                               pioneer seeds, and effects of herbivore exclusion on succession.                                                                                                Date on vine-host interactions will help evaluate the                           effectiveness of specific plant traits in shedding vines that                   retard post-logging succession.                                                 Other experiments focus on later successional stages and                        favorability of pioneers as \"nurse plants\" for recolonization by                                                                                                persistent dipterocarps.  Experiments compare dipterocarp                       germination and survivorship in pioneer and primary forests.                    Enrichment plantings of dipterocarp seedlings with and without                  trenching quantify below-ground competition from pioneers.                      Moderate liberation thinning of pioneers over dipterocarps will                 help assess responses of different sized dipterocarps to release                                                                                                from light competition.",
