 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Capsid of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is an icosahedral             (T=16) protein shell approximately 15 nm thick and 125nm in                     diameter.  In the intact virus, the capsid contains the viral dsDNA             and it is surrounded by a lipid membrane.  The goal of this project             is to assemble the HSV-1 capsid in vitro beginning with purified                capsid proteins.  Capsids will be isolated from the nuclei of HSV-              1- infected cells and dissociated into their six component protein              with dissociating/denaturing agents such as guanidine-HC1 or urea.              Individual capsid proteins will then be purified and added together             under conditions designed to promote their re-assembly into                     icosahedral capsids.  Reaction mixtures will be examined for the                presence of re-assembled capsids by electron microscopy, sucrose                density gradient ultracentrifugation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel                 electrophoresis.  Also, studies involving the use of specific                   monoclonal antibodies will be carried out to define the locations               of capsid proteins VP19, VP23, and VP26.  Specific goals of the                 project are to:  (1) define the morphology, total mass and protein              stoichiometry of torus-shaped structures self-assembled in vitro                from purified capsid protein VP22a; (2) identify conditions in                  which native VP26 can re-attach to HSV-1 capsids that lack it and               define the location of VP26 in reconstituted capsids; (3) define                conditions in which purified VP, the major capsid protein, can                  assembly in vitro into T=16 icosahedra.  Assembly may require the               presence of other capsid proteins such as the scaffolding protein,              VP22a: and (4) prepare monoclonal antibodies specific for capsid                proteins VP19, VP23, and VP26, and use them (in conjunction with                electron microscopic methods) to localize their cognate proteins in             the HSV-1 capsid.",
