 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hippocampal formation is part of the brain known to be                      critically involved in learning and memory.  Hippocampal damage in              humans caused profound, nearly global amnesia for events which                  occur after the lesion.  One type of ability affected is spatial,               or navigational learning.  Individuals with hippocampal damage                  cannot learn their way around a new environment.                                                                                                                Some insight into how the hippocampus may accomplish its role in                spatial learning has come from studies which examine the activity               of single cells in the hippocampus in vertebrates as they navigate              in an environment.  In each part of the hippocampal region studied              to date, cells show striking spatial correlates.  Cells in one                  region fire in a location-specific manner, so that they are active              only when the animal is within a particular, circumscribed region               of space.  Cells in another area fire only when the animal is                   facing a particular direction, regardless of its location.  In yet              a third area, cells fire as a function of both direction and                    location.                                                                                                                                                       Dr. Sharp will examine the spatial firing correlates of the cells               in the hippocampal area.  She will examine the basic spatial firing             properties of cells in part of the hippocampal region which have                not yet been studies.  This will provide novel information about                the nature of the spatial signal in the hippocampal formation.  In              addition, Dr. Sharp will conduct analytical studies to discover the             sensory and mnemonic determinants of the spatial firing properties              of cells in these areas, as well as in areas in which the basic                 spatial properties are already known.                                                                                                                           Another aspect of her work will be to examine changes in                        hippocampal physiology which result from exposing animals to                    spatially-complex environments.  These long-lasting changes are                 thought to possibly reflect information storage mechanisms in the               hippocampus.  Thus, examination of the timecourse, mechanisms, and              conditions of such neuronal plasticity could provide insight into               how the hippocampal area orchestrates learning.                                                                                                                 Dr. Sharp's results will be used to try to understand the role                  played by the hippocampus in learning and memory, specifically as               it relates to the onset of Alzheimer's disease in the aging                     brain.***//",
