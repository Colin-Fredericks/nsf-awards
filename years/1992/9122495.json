 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Solar-Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP) is an international                 program to advance the understanding of the transfer of energy                  and mass through the solar-terrestrial environment.  STEP                       involves ground-based, aircraft, balloon, rocket and satellite                  experiments; theory and simulation studies; and dedicated data                  and information systems.  The program will take advantage of                    results obtained by spacecraft missions and related programs such               as NSF's GEM, CEDAR, and MAX91, research and monitoring                         activities of NOAA/SEL,  and various research activites supported               by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and other key sponsors of                 solar-terrestrial research.  The framework of STEP consists of                  Priority Areas, each one with a goal of understanding the                       processes controlling energy and mass transfer between specific                 regions of the solar-terrestrial system.  The scientific                        research in STEP is organized into a limited number of well-                    defined cooperative projects proposed by the scientific                         communities of the participating countries.  To define, plan and                implement the research coordination, Working Groups for each                    Priority Area have been established.  STEP is the key                           international coordination effort, fully inclusive of various                   research modes, active during the first half of the 1990's.  This               grant provides partial support of the STEP Symposium on initial                 results from STEP facilities and theory campaigns to be held                    August 24-27, 1992, at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics                 Laboratory.  Additional support for this symposium is anticipated               from NASA, NSF, NOAA, and ONR.",
