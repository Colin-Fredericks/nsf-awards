 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the                      Chemistry Division is supporting continuation of a research                     program by Professor William Reinhardt at the University of                     Washington to investigate chaotic Hamiltonian systems, their                    phase space structures, and semi-classical quantization.  New                   work is concentrating on the properties of water in                             inhomogeneous states, the surface melting of polar molecular                    solids, and the development of new methods for determination of                 entropies and free energies of solvated systems from trajectory                 and Monte Carlo simulation.  In a second part of the research,                  a scalable, massively parallel computer is being constructed                    from 24 RS/6000 processors to provide computing speeds in the                   range of 200-300 Mflops.  The system will be used to explorea                   variety of problems in theoretical chemistry and develop                        parallel codes and algorithms for their solution.                               %%%                                                                             In surface melting, there is a very inhomogeneous environment                   at the surface boundary layer.  Phase transitions in this                       environment are being studied from fundamental quantum and                      classical mechanical viewpoints using extensive Monte Carlo                     computations.  A parallel processor computer is being                           constructed to meet the needs of theoretical chemistry for                      higher computing speeds than are available from the present                     generation of supercomputers.",
