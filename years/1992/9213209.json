 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research in Undergraduate Institutions award (RUI)                    provides support for a study of three major ideological movements               in the contemporary Middle East.  The first is Islamic modernism,               which became the dominant political tendency within Islam in the                late nineteenth and early twentieth century.  The second is the                 ebb of Islam and the rise of various secular ideologies such as                 nationalism and liberalism in the early to mid-twentieth century.               The third is the rise of fundamentalist Islam as the dominant                   tendency within the opposition movements largely in the sixties                 and thereafter.  The study will use archival materials for Egypt,               Iran, India, Pakistan and Syria to examine the causes of the rise               of these ideological movements, and to examine the connection                   between macro socioeconomic and political changes and the rise or               decline in ideological movements in the Middle East.                                 This study will provide a scientific understanding of                      Islamic and other movements in the Middle Eastern countries, and                by doing so it may overcome some of the misconceptions that                     exists in Western cultures on the nature of contemporary Middle                 Eastern societies and the nature of Islamic movements in general.",
