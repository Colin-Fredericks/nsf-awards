The IPS is an international,                            interdisciplinary society of scientists who study nonhuman                      primates.  The aims of the IPS are to encourage all areas of                    primate research, to facilitate cooperation among workers of all                nationalities who are engaged in such research, and to promote                  the conservation and judicious scientific use of nonhuman                       primates throughout the world.  The IPS has approximately 1,000                 active members in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and                    Africa.  The scheduled scientific program of the 14th Congress                  includes plenary lectures, symposia, paper sessions, workshops,                 and exhibits.  In addition, there are a business meeting of the                 general membership, meetings of the Executive Committee, and                    numerous opportunities for informal exchange among the                          membership.",
