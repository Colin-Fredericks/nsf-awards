 "awd_abstract_narration": "The underlying theme of this mathematical research is the                  analysis of solutions of nonlinear partial differential                         equations, particularly in conservative evolution equations that                arise in mathematical physics and in fluid dynamics.  Emphasis                  will be on the study of the existence question for classes of                   equations, in particular, the existence of periodic solutions,                  and the study of a priori regularity and other properties of the                evolution.  The work is limited to three objectives.  First, in                 the area of infinite dimensional dynamical systems and KAM                      theory, continuing research will be done in extending techniques                of Hamiltonian perturbation applied to the wave equation to other               equations and to investigate methods related to studies in higher               space dimensions.  The second direction involves smoothing                      properties of dispersive equations.  It has been known for some                 time that solutions of dispersive evolution equations can be                    smoother than their initial conditions.  But their quadratic                    norms can grow unbounded without cut-off restrictions in spatial                directions.  Work will be done to isolate the parts of the                      equations which contribute to the growth and try to develop                     estimates on the norm size.  The final part of the project                      studies waves in free surfaces and interfaces.  The problem,                    known as Stokes conjecture, concerns the solitary wave of                       extremal form.  Such waves are known to be analytic except at                   their crest.  It is the object of this study to show (i) that a                 Lipschitz singularity of interior angle 120 degrees must occur at               the crest and (ii) that the extremal wave profile is monotone                   decreasing and convex on either side.                                                Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws expressible in                terms of the interactions and relationships between partial                     derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not to state the                   relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative and                           quantitative meaning from them.",
