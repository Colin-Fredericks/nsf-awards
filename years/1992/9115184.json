 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program consists of two research initiatives, one that                focuses on interannual and longer term variability of intense                   tropical cyclone in the Atlantic region as related to West                      African rainfall and the other which examines how the                           stratospheric QBO modulates intense equatorial convection and,                  thereby, affects the longer term variability of the ENSO.                            The PI has shown that recurrent variations of intense                      Atlantic hurricane activity are closely correlated with                         concurrent variations of rainfall in the West Africa Sahel                      region.  Ongoing studies seek to develop a conceptual model of                  the physical processes linking both hurricane variability and                   Sahel drought with observed global-scale climate variations.  The               PI plans to examine the effects of local and regional feedback                  processes in West Africa as well as larger scale factors                        affecting conditions in the tropical Atlantic and in more remote                areas.  This portion of the program will contribute to our                      understanding of the climatological variability of processes                    governing the genesis,intensification, movement an longevity of                 Atlantic tropical cyclones while also providing improvements to                 seasonal forecasts of Atlantic hurricane activity.                                   The second, but subordinant (about 35-40% of the total                     effort) research initiative is directed to understanding an                     apparent association between variable stratospheric QBO, induced                wind shear and temperature anomalies in the lower stratosphere in               relation to concentrated deep convection over the equatorial West               Pacific.  QBO induced convective oscillations appears to have a                 strong physical link with ENSO cycle variations.                                     This research is important because it seeks to increase                    understanding of the interannual variability of climate.",
