 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transistor that makes the modern                                            computer memory possible works as an                                            electronic switch.  When there are no                                           electrons on the transistor no current can flow                                 and the transistor is turned off.  When the                                     voltage on a gate electrode is increased,                                       electrons are added to the transistor and it                                    turns on.  In a collaboration between MIT                                       and IBM it was recently discovered that very                                    small transistors behave in a very unusual way.                                 In contrast to conventional transistors which                                   have only two possible states, either on or off,                                a very small transistor turns on and off again                                  every time one electron is added to it by the                                   gate.  The single-electron behavior has so far                                  been observed only at very low temperatures.                                    In order to make devices that are potentially                                   useful for electronic applications, a much                                      higher temperature must be reached.  The                                        operating temperature is determined by the                                      energy necessary to transfer an electron from                                   one of its leads onto the transistor.  The work                                 proposed will isolate the parameters that                                       determine this energy scale, making possible                                    single-electron devices operating at practical                                  temperatures.  Experiments to test the                                          ultimate speed of single-electron transistors                                   are also planned.",
