 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rivers Project curriculum seeks to offer students and                       teachers the opportunity to engage in an activity based                         program with real world implications for the environment.                       Its goal is to develop a national rivers curriculum that can                    cross the boundaries of traditional curricular areas to                         unite science, social science and English.  The curriculum                      will propel a student force of \"River Watchers\" who will                        research and monitor rivers in their respective communities.                    A set of teaching materials will be developed that will:  be                    applicable to any river; include chemistry, biology, and                        geology/geography units; be interdisciplinary and                               incorporate English and social science elements into each                       set of materials; focus on teaching data collection and                         interpretation; and use a computer telecommunication network                    to transmit and evaluate river data and writings.  This                         curriculum development project will be a cooperative venture                    with state and national agencies, as well as business and                       industry.  The data that will be collected can be used to                       solve problems and can contribute to scientific, historical,                    and data bases.  When a Rivers Project school collects data,                    local state, and federal agencies will be able to access and                    assess the information.  Teachers and students will, in                         turn, devise and conduct workshops for fellow River Watcher                     interns, creating a network of interested, involved and                         learning educators and young scientists whose ultimate goal                     will be to work for safe, clean rivers.  Although the                           outcomes of the program target improved student                                 understandings of river-related science concepts and facts,                     the major thrust will be to communicate a clearer view of                       the nature and processes of science and to actively involve                     students in the development of environmentally responsible                      behaviors.",
