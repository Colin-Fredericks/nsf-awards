 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dissertation student:  Peter J. Ramberg;  Dissertation topic:                   \"The Early History of Stereochemistry, 1874-1920.\"                              Mr. Ramberg is studying several cases in the early history of                   stereochemistry that show how chemists became convinced that they               were dealing with a new cause of chemical phenomena.  He is                     investigating how and why chemists came to the conclusion that                  spatial characteristics were a \"real\" cause of chemical                         phenomena.  Using the unpublished manuscripts of Johannes                       Wislicenus and Victor Meyer, as well as the published chemical                  record, Mr. Ramberg is examining the birth of stereochemistry and               is exploring the reasons for its appeal to chemists as well as                  the reasons some objected to its importance.  Following an                      examination of the birth of stereochemistry, Mr. Ramberg is also                examining three early case studies where stereo chemical                        principles were invoked:  1) theories of unsaturation,  2)                      nitrogen compounds, and 3) the discovery and explanation of the                 Walden inversion.  The story of the adoption of and resistance to               stereochemical principles reveals many assumptions and                          undercurrents in chemical theory of the late 19th century.   The                issues raised include the role of spatial properties in chemical                explanations, the reinterpretation of the old theoretical                       language of chemistry, the relationship between chemical theory                 and chemical evidence, the shift in focus from composition to                   transformation, the autonomy of chemistry from physics, and the                 peculiar concentration of stereochemists in Germany.",
