 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational Geometry is primarily the study of geometric                      algorithms.  Thus the geometric aspect of problems considered                   by computational geometers is as important as the algorithm                     and data structuring aspect.  Sometimes the connection is                       explicit, e.g, when the number of features of a geometric                       object provides a worst-case lower bound on the running time                    to compute it.  Other times the relation is less obvious, but                   just as crucial.                                                                                                                                                This project is concerned with geometric arrangements from a                    primarily combinatorial rather than computational point of                      view, with investigation of algorithmic issues as a secondary                   goal.  The focus is on the geometric complexity problems,                       which involve estimating the number of features in certain                      portions of an arrangement.  Such combinatorial bounds lead to                  construction of efficient geometric algorithms and to                           establishing sharp lower bounds on their performance.                                                                                                           Planar arrangements of various classes of objects and general                   hyperplane arrangements have been studied extensively, but                      until recently rather little was known about arrangements of                    such simple objects as flat triangles in three-dimensional                      space.  Building on some recent work, the investigation of                      this subject will be continued, initially concentrating on                      triangle arrangements.  The study of simplex arrangements is                    expected to lead to new techniques applicable to more general                   families of objects in three and higher dimensions, which will                  in turn yield better tools for the design and analysis of                       geometric algorithms.",
