 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will examine the mechanism of ferric enterobactin                  passage through its Escherichia coli outer membrane receptor,FepA.              Binding, in which the siderophore or colicin associates with                    specific residues of FepA that are located on the external surface              of the bacterial cell; Uptake, in which the receptor, by                        interaction with TonB, undergoes conformational change or other                 mechanisms, facilitates the movement of ferric enterobactin through             the OM bilayer. A variety of biochemical, molecular genetic, and                immunological approaches to these problems will be utilized,                    including random and site-specific mutagenesis, genetic selection               for FepA proteins that function independently of TonB, and                      immunochemical purification of cell envelope proteins that may                  physically associate with FepA during ferric enterobactin uptake.               These investigations will enhance understanding of the mechanism by             which two distinct secreted proteins, colicins B and D, and a                   siderophore, ferric enterobactin, interact with a single receptor,              FepA.  They will augment knowledge of bacterial outer membrane                  protein structure, and provide specific information about the                   physiology of TonB-dependent outer membrane proteins.                           %%%                                                                             The research will determine how a bacterial membrane receptor                   protein recognizes and transports small molecules into the cell.                The membrane protein of interest, Escherichia coli FepA, is                     essential for the acquisition of iron.  Theoretically, the                      structure of this receptor is akin to a barrel with a lid, that                 usually remains closed to protect the cell from noxious molecules               in its environment, but can open to permit entry of iron-containing             nutrients.  To test this model experiments that subdivide the                   transport process into two stages have been designed:                           Binding, in which the receptor protein recognizes iron-containing               molecules and holds them on the cell surface.  Uptake, in which the             iron is transferred across the cell membrane, presumably by moving              through the 'lid' region of the receptor, and into the barrel                   domain.  A variety of biochemical, molecular genetic, and                       immunological approaches to these problems will be utilized.  The               experiments will enhance understanding of the mechanism by which                small molecules are recognized and captured by bacterial cells.                 They will be also improve knowledge of the structure of membrane                proteins, and the transfer of energy across membranes.",
