 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is to investigate the origin and                     periodicity of rhythmically interbedded limestone-marl couplets in              four separate Paleozoic basinal marine sequences.  In each of the               sequences, the limestone-marl couplets are characterized by                     decimeter-scale alternations of even-bedded, laminated limestone                and marls; well-preserved calcareous fossils in marl layers                     indicates a primary depositional(versus diagenetic origin) to the               interbeds.  Spectral analysis of the limestone-marl interbeds will              be conducted to determine whether there is a regularly cyclicity                to the bedding couplets, and the duration of the cycles will be                 determined from a range of sedimentation rates calculated for each              individual sequence.                                                                 A planning grant is submitted to study the sedimentologic                  origin and periodicity pf rhythmically bedded limestone-marl                    couplets in one of the proposed sequences; the Middle Cambrian of               western Utah (Wheeler and Marjum Formations).  The emphasis of the              pilot project is to develop accurate and time-efficient sampling                techniques for generating time series in interbedded limestone and              marl facies.  In previous studies, time series generated from                   variations in HCI-insoluble residues has proven to be an accurate               method, however it is very laboratory-time intensive.                           Consequently, three other less-time consuming methods will be                   tested on the Middle Cambrian couplets determine which technique                (s) best reflects the rhythmic nature of the deposits.                               Specific planning grant activities will include describing and             interpreting the sedimentologic and stratigraphic characteristics               of the basinal facies, evaluating the lateral continuity of                     limestone-marl couplets, sampling the best-exposed section for                  variations in HCI-insoluble residues, magnetic properties, and bed-             thickness variations.  Results from spectral analysis of the                    different time series will be compared to determine which time                  series sampling technique(s) are appropriate for interbedded                    limestone-marl facies.                                                               The cause of millennial-scale paleoclimatic fluctuations is                not well understood, however they have been attributed to changes               in solar activity or due to the nonlinear response of the climate               to precessional (~20,000 yr) orbital forcing.  If the periods of                such persistent oscillations can be characterized, they offer the               potential for developing high-resolution chronostratigraphy, with               a greater resolution than Milankovitch cycles, that can be used to              calibrate the length of time between absolute datums, variations                in sedimentation rates, biologic evolution rates, and the time                  intervals over which geomagnetic reversals occur.",
