 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, Professor Lester Andrews of the                      University of Virginia will investigate the matrix isolation                    spectroscopy of some exotic chemical species.  Systems to be                    examined in this work include metal atom complexes having                       pi-electron systems, metal complexes with carboranes,                           transition metal hydride or dihydrogen complexes, transition                    metal complexes involving carbon monoxide and molecular                         hydrogen as model Fischer-Tropsch catalysts, aluminum atom                      reactions with small molecules, and heavy Group VA and VIA atom                 chemistry.  A pulsed-laser evaporation method will be used in                   many of these experiments to form the metal complexes, while                    microwave discharges will be used to make metal clusters.                       Infrared and electronic absorption and resonance Raman                          spectroscopy are among the experimental tools to be used.                       %%%                                                                             Professor Andrews uses the technique of matrix isolation                        spectroscopy to study the structure of molecules which are so                   unstable that they normally are not observed under ordinary                     laboratory conditions.  In this technique, the species of                       interest are generated and then quickly trapped at very low                     temperatures in frozen rare gas matrices.  Included among                       species studied are the intermediates formed in chemical                        reactions, weakly-bound molecules, or highly reactive forms.                    Such molecules are difficult or impossible to characterize by                   other experimental techniques.",
