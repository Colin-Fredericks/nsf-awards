 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognition memory is the type of memory in which people can                    recognize whether or not they have seen an item or experienced an               event before.  It is a basic form of memory, essential for normal               cognitive function; its absence is a sign of very severe pathology.             Recent work has shown that normal recognition memory is                         characterized by strong regularities that permit the analysis of                its underlying psychological mechanisms.  One such regularity is                that anything that affects performance on old items, items seen                 before, such as increased study time or forgetting, also affects                performance on new items, those not seen before, in exactly the                 same way.  For example, if forgetting is produced by increasing the             time from presentation of old items to test, an individual performs             more poorly on the old items, as one might expect, but also                     performs more poorly on new items; this is unexpected, since the                new items will never have been seen before the test and might be                expected to be unaffected by a delay preceding the test.  The                   symmetry of the effect indicates that the individual performs                   (though almost certainly not consciously) a complex analysis of the             state of items, an analysis of the sort expected by a particular                set of decision theories, including signal detection theory.  This              research will explore this regularity experimentally, as well as                related regularities, and develop a mathematical description of the             underlying decision process that produces the regularities.",
