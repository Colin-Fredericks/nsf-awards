 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global cycles of sea-level rise and fall have operated throughout               much of Earth's history.  The exact timing and size of these                    eustatic changes, however, are as yet comparatively poorly-                     constrained, particularly for Pre-Pleistocene time.  Detailed sea-              level history curves are, in turn, essential to understanding the               complex interplay between astronomical forcing mechanisms, and                  glacial and sea-level maxima and minima.                                                                                                                        The geologic record spanning Oligocene to Miocene time may offer                key information as to the nature and timing of sea-level changes.               This time-span was characterized by a number of sea-level cycles,               reflecting ice-sheet waxing and waning.  The Oligocene-Miocene                  record is particularly well-preserved in sedimentary rocks of the               Mid-Atlantic coastal plain, and continental shelf-slope-rise                    region.  This project seeks to refine the sea-level history curves              for Oligocene-Miocene time through examination of high-resolution               seismic reflection, Sr-isotope, delta-Oxygen-18, and other                      stratigraphic data from the U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast.  It is a                   renewal; previous work focused on the collection and preliminary                analysis of the seismic reflection and biostratigraphic data.   The             project will impact planning and design of an upcoming Ocean                    Drilling Project Leg offshore New Jersey.  The principal                        investigators are an interdisciplinary team who are well-qualified              to perform this research project.",
