 "awd_abstract_narration": "Risk is a central fact of life in the rural areas of less                       developed countries.  There is a vast, mainly theoretical                       literature that explores the consequences of risk for individual                behavior and the evolution of institutions.  In the absence of                  complete insurance markets, households utilize a variety of                     economic strategies in order to mitigate the consequences of                    risk.  The purpose of this project is to analyze the joint saving               and credit market decisions made by households as they attempt to               cope with risk in a social setting characterized by an important,               but incomplete mutual insurance network in northern Nigeria.                    Saving and credit transactions take on a special role when                      insurance markets are incomplete by allowing households to smooth               their consumption streams in the face of random income                          fluctuations.                                                                                                                                                   This issue will be analyzed using data collected in a nine-round                survey of the region in 1988-1989.  This rich data set will                     permit an investigation of the ex post strategies adopted by                    households in response to the recent receipt of random shocks.                  The analysis will be based on joint estimation of the effect of                 random shocks on net asset sales and net borrowing, taking into                 account the structure of the credit market revealed in earlier                  work.  An understanding of the magnitude of the consumption-                    smoothing motivation for asset accumulation is a prerequisite for               a more general analysis of the level and composition of rural                   investment.  In addition, the findings should contribute to                     current discussions regarding interventions designed to reduce                  the vulnerability of households to drought.",
