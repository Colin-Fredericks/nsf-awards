 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed effort will focus on extension and application                of an existing, two-dimensional, numerical model of the mid- and                low-latitide current systems within the ionosphere.  This                       variable-grid model is based on magnetic field-line integrated                  quantities and solves for scales from global down to medium (5km)               electric fields.  First, the model will be used to investigate                  the evening perturbation to the Sq (solar quiet) current system                 which is responsible for the rapid rise of the ionosphere after                 local solar sunset.  This will provide a self-consistent                        numerical test of the theory presented by Haerendel et al.                      \u01311990! on the post-sunset rise.  Once the numerical study of the                global scale electric field is completed, a finer grid will be                  employed to investigate the explosive development of                            irregularities within the evening F Region plasma called                        Equatorial Spread F (ESF).  While the driving mechanism of ESF is               well understood (gravitational Rayleigh-Taylor instability), the                initiation or \"seeding of the instability process is still not                  established.  Initially, seeding will be omitted to see if                      Equatorial Spread F develops from the nonlinear first order                     electric field variation.  Then seeding from neutral-                           wave/ionosphere interactions such as spatial resonance effects                  will be examined.",
