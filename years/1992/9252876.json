 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer Science Camp Program is designed to rejuvenate the                   student interest in natural science and mathematics at an early age.            Annually, forty-eight seventh and eighth grade African-American                 students are exposed to natural sciences, mathematics,                          communication skills and computer science in an intensive                       four-week residential summer session at Jackson State University                (JSU).  Activities include classroom instruction and laboratory                 demonstrations/experiments and involve individual as well as group              interaction with communication skills (oral and written), applications          of mathematical concepts, and computer applications.  Upper level               science technology students serve as mentors for the participants and           continue this contact throughout the academic year as well as actively          assist the instructors.  In addition, speakers from local industry and          JSU serve as invited speakers; students take field trips to science             museums, planetariums and federal laboratories.  Students will                  participate in similar programs until grade twelve and will be tracked          throughout their academic career.",
