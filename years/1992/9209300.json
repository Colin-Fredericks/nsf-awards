 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to determine the relative importance of acyl                chains and phospholipid head groups in the formation of lipid                   domains in erythrocyte membranes and model membranes. Fluorescence              digital imaging microscopy and steady state fluorescence polari-                zation techniques will be used. Fluorescently labeled phospholipids             which differ in head groups and acyl chains will be synthesized or              purchased, and the distribution of pairs differing in either head               groups or acyl chains will be determined by both techniques. Three              results are possible, and should allow resolution of disparate                  results obtained by the two techniques.                                         %%%                                                                             All cellular membranes contain compounds known as phospholipids,                which have two distinct components: groups which prefer water,                  because they have charged parts, and groups which are components of             fats. It is not clear whether the two components are equally impor-             tant, or whether one is very important and the other is less so.                Experiments are planned using two quite different techniques. Both              measure the environment of specially labeled phospholipids.                     Mixtures of these lipids will be used with model membranes and                  membranes from red blood cells, to see if both components                       contribute equally to positioning in the membranes or not.",
