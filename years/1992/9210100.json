 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blind adaptive equalizers are important elements in high data rate              digital communication systems to remove linear distortions incurred             by nonideal and bandlimited channels. By removing linear channel                distortions without the aid of a training sequence, blind                       equalization makes it unnecessary for the transmitter to interrupt              the normal data transmission in order to generate a training signal             for the sake of a newly tuned receiver. Despite the plethora of                 existing blind equalization schemes, few exhibit the desired global             convergence property. Many existing blind equalizers are prone to               undesirable local convergence corresponding to little or no                     intersymbol interference removal, as shown in the previous works                by the principal investigator and others. In addition, the                      convergence rates of many of the existing algorithms are very slow.             A principal objective of this research is to improve the                        performance of blind equalization systems by designing new and                  better blind equalization algorithms.                                                                                                                           Various linear and nonlinear constraints will be utilized in                    developing, analyzing and testing fast and globally convergent                  equalization algorithms.  The cyclostationary nature of the PAM/QAM             modulated channel output will be exploited to generate innovative               designs of blind equalizers. In addition, various stochastic                    dynamic systems analysis tools (such as probability and stochastic              processes, spectral analysis, averaging and stability theory) will              continue to be exploited in this study, as it has been in many                  previous adaptive system studies. However, unlike most of the                   previous studies, cyclostationary signal analysis will also be                  utilized in the design of blind equalizers based on the                         cyclostationarity of the channel output.                                                                                                                        The proposed research is aimed at expanding the utility of the                  concept of blind adaptive equalization and applications of                      broadcast digital communication systems, and is expected to have                significant direct and indirect impact on the application of                    adaptive systems in areas such as adaptive system control,                      robotics, array processing, mechanical and aerospace engineering,               and geophysical signal processing.",
