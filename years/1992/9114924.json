 "awd_abstract_narration": "A laboratory plasma experiment is proposed to investigate the              fundamental topology of magnetic reconnection regions and                       associated magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) phenomena.  Reconnection is                well established as a fundamental process of importance to                      understanding the geospace environment, from magnetospheric                     substorms and the magnetopause to solar flares.  The proposed                   experiment will test whether reconnection is a laminar two-                     dimensional process, the model of prevailing theories, or whether               three-dimensional structures will spontaneously arise.  A very                  flexible double-spheromak configuration is proposed with six                    different operating regimes that should have quite different flow               patterns, as well as variations in the initial configuration from               two-dimensional (with toroidal symmetry) to fully three-                        dimensional.  A novel element in reconnection physics that will be              tested is the generation of flows along the neutral-line direction              which arise for counter-helicity reconnection but not for co-                   helicity.  Institutional support for theoretical research will                  simulate merging spheromaks with three-dimensional resistive MHD                codes and these simulation results will be checked against the                  laboratory results.",
