 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet telecommunications network is a resource that                      has begun to be utilized in many arenas, yet has a potential                    for K-12 learning that is unexplored and unstudied.  As a                       component of the Boulder Valley Project, a school                               district/university/industry partnership which is deploying                     Internet connectivity to an entire school district, Kids as                     Global Scientists will couple the implementation of Internet                    technology with detailed research on student learning,                          collaboration models, and interface design for a K-12                           audience.  In particular, the project will contribute: 1)                       Insights into the study of seventh graders' understanding of                    atmospheric science concepts while investigating rich and                       dynamic representations of weather phenomena, 2) new models                     for communities and teacher interaction, and 3) prototype                       Internet interfaces for K-12 audiences.                                                                                                                         Internet connectivity within Middle School Internet                             Laboratories will allow classrooms of students to collect                       and interpret National Weather Service data and satellite                       images of an extensive variety of weather phenomena.                            Telecommunications within the District will support vertical                    curricular themes, teleapprenticeships, and new models of                       proximal and virtual communities.  Extensive work with                          teachers-as-project-members will expand current models of                       teachers-as-researchers/learners/curriculum developers.                         Middle school students will be Global Scientists both in                        their extensive study of North American and world weather,                      and in their ability to communicate and personalize weather                     phenomena with scientists of all ages, both locally and                         world-wide.",
