 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will carry out research to test the hypothesis                     that when high school physics teachers learn a guided,                          hands-on inquiry approach to teaching physics and apply this                    to their students, the student will develop a better                            understanding of physics and become more interested in                          science.  Furthermore this will result in students                              continuing to take science in their later educational                           activities and perhaps embarking upon science careers.  The                     research will involve a double strand study comparing                           students whose teachers have taken teacher enhancement                          projects emphasizing special techniques with those whose                        teachers who have not.  The research will isolate and                           quantify indicators which determine the extent to which                         students have been influenced by teachers using techniques                      developed in teacher enhancement workshops.  The results                        will help guide the development of teacher enhancement                          programs.
