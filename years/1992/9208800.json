 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the effects of legal counsel from the                   perspective of \"party capability theory,\" a set of ideas which                  proposes that powerful and organized parties who use courts                     routinely hold tactical and strategic advantage over weaker                     parties, especially individual litigants who use judicial resources             only intermittently.                                                                                                                                            Specifically, it investigates whether and how disparities between               counsel related resources affect the ruling made by an appellate                court.  In addition, the research employs a multivariate                        statistical model to assess the importance of counsel related                   resources in relation to other explanations for outcomes in                     appellate courts.  In addition to advancing empirical understanding             of whether and how lawyers make a difference in litigation, the                 cross-national framework, focusing on the English Court of Appeals,             enables exploration of the extent to which party capability theory              is context-bound to the U.S. experience.",
