 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to understand                                     the effects of space charge on the                                              resolution of photoelectron microscopes                                         operating at high current densities, to                                         improve their resolution, and to exploit the                                    space charge nonlinearity for pulse                                             measurements and other applications.  The                                       photoelectron microscope is an instrument                                       in which light induces electron emission                                        from a sample and the electrons are                                             focussed to form a highly magnified image                                       of the sample surface.  Its uses are in                                         crystal growth, biology, catalysis, and                                         microelectronics.  Earlier theoretical and                                      experimental studies of space charge                                            limited resolution are in poor agreement.                                       Illuminators now used are almost entirely                                       incoherent sources rather than lasers                                           because of performance difficulties                                             encountered with the latter.  In this project                                   a spherical-potential electron optical                                          system will be used with various types of                                       laser illumination to evaluate resolution as                                    a function of emission current density.  The                                    theory of space charge aberrations will be                                      extended to this case and compared with                                         experimental results.  Space charge effects                                     provide an adjustable, very fast nonlinearity                                   which may be used for pulse duration                                            measurements and other signal processing                                        applications.",
