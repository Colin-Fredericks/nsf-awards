 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a telecommunication system, the denial of service requests              according to customer type or systems state, even when excess                   capacity exists, can improve system performance.  Finding good call             admission policies is therefore an important part of system design.                  The principal investigators (PIs) propose a probabilistic                  algorithm to search for call admission policies in                              telecommunications systems.  Such a procedure decouples policy                  evaluation from policy search and in this way allows consideration              of problems which seem intractable using analytic methods.  The                 policies found are expected to yield insight which will allow                   useful analytic approximations to be employed.  As a case in point,             the PIs considered the M/M/c/c queue with two customer classes.                 The search procedure was able to find nearly optimal solutions                  whose structure strongly suggested the known optimal policy                     structure.  It is proposed that this study be extended first to                 other simple systems which appear frequently at communications                  systems models and then to specific problems in the fields of                   mobile communications an high speed networks.",
