 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although much progress has been made in elucidating the                    phylogeny and systematics of placental mammals, many difficult                  problems still remain.  These problems involve not only the order               Primates, which has humans among its members, but also the 17 other             orders of placental mammals.  For example, one of the most                      important primate groups is the superfamily Ceboidea comprised of               New World monkeys and marmosets, but the pattern of evolution over              the last 25 million years that led from a common ancestor to the                16 surviving genera of these neotropical primates is poorly                     understood.  Similarly, a series of phylogenetic branching events               that occurred between 90 and 65 million years ago separated the 18              surviving orders of placental mammals from one another, but the                 exact course of branching, i.e. the evolutionary relationships                  among these major groups of placental mammals, has yet to be                    definitively established.  Recent technical advances in molecular               biology have made it possible to obtain large amounts of DNA                    nucleotide sequence data from corresponding genes in a wide range               of species.  Since the sequence of nucleotide in DNA is the genetic             or heritable material, such information provides a very precise                 record of the evolutionary relationships of the species compared.               Through utilizing the new molecular methods for generating                      comparative nucleotide sequence data, DNA information from several              different genes will be obtained from the above mentioned mammalian             groups.  These data will be subjected to rigorous phylogenetic                  analysis, using computer programs based on theoretical models that              best describe the course of genetic change over time.                                This phylogenetic analysis, when applied to the DNA sequence               data from the more rapidly evolving portions of the genes, is                   expected to provide a highly resolved picture of the evolutionary               relationships that exist among the 16 genera of neotropical                     primates.  Similarly, this analysis applied to the slower revolving             genic portions should provide a well resolved picture of the                    evolutionary relationships that exist among the 18 orders of                    placental mammals.  In addition to reconstructing the pattern of                phylogenetic branching, rates of DNA change along the branches will             be determined.  This information on rates, when related to                      knowledge on the life history strategies of the animals included                in the study, will test the hypothesis that life history changes                towards longer generation times and life spans cause decreases in               DNA mutation rates, whereas life history changes towards shorter                generation times and life spans cause increases in DNA mutation                 rates.",
