 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project between Dr. Timothy P.                Lodge of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and Dr. P.                     Stepanek of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences will be to                     perform extensive experimental examination of the dynamics of                   block copolymer liquids.  Their focus will be the weak segregation              regime, defined to incorporate order-disorder transition and the                adjunct ordered and disordered states.  The researchers will use                dynamic light scattering to  investigate both block copolymer melts             and solutions, especially:  chain length and concentration; block               copolymer composition; the segment-segment interaction                          parameter; and temperature.  They will pay particular attention to              the number, angular dependence, and identification of the modes                 which appear in the experimental correlation functions.  The large              characteristic time constants involved will pose challenges which               demand various exploratory stategies.  The researchers will                     interpret the results in the framework of emerging theoretical                  descriptions, anticipating that dynamical mean-field approximations             are unlikely to be adequate.  These measurements will complement                rheological, rheo-optical, tracer diffusion, and small-angle                    scattering studies at the University of Minnesota.                                                                                                              This project in chemistry fulfills the program objective of                     advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the               United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                       talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and               competence.",
