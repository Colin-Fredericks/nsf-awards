 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of separation science.  During the                tenure of this three-year continuing RUI grant, Professor Pesek                 and his students will pursue the development of chemical                        modification procedures for alteration of porous silica stationary              phases for high performance liquid chromatography and glass                     capillary walls for high performance capillary electrophoresis.                 The synthetic approach involves converting surface silanol                      functionalities to hydrides which can be further reacted by                     hydrosilation reactions to produce bonded organic moieties.  These              bonded materials have a direct carbon-silicon bond to the surface               instead of the more common siloxane linkage which arises from                   standard organosilane reactions procedures.  The direct linkage                 has been proven both chromatographically and electrophoretically                to be more stable than the siloxane linkages to a much wider range              of analytical solution environments.  Additionally, bonded liquid               crystal stationary phases will be further developed and                         characterized spectroscopically, thermally, and                                 chromatographically.                                                            %%%                                                                             This research builds upon results obtained under Dr. Pesek's                    previous NSF grant, CHE-8814849, and will enable a clearer                      definition of the mobile phase/stationary phase interface.                      Additionally, this research should provide insightful guidance for              the more rational and efficient design and synthesis of liquid                  crystal chromatographic stationary phases.",
