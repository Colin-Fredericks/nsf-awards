 "awd_abstract_narration": "LIVING ON EARTH is a new weekly National Public Radio                           newsmagazine about the people and politics of environmental                     change.  It goes beyond the ecological segments on NPR's ALL                    THINGS CONSIDERED and MORNING EDITION to meet the growing demand                for consistent, high quality, balanced and in-depth coverage of                 the environment, and scientific discoveries and advancements                    relevant to the rapidly changing ecology of our planet.                                                                                                         Audience research consistently shows that information about the                 environment is a priority to a broad majority of public radio                   listeners, and these listeners are twice as likely as all adults                to take personal and political action in relation to                            environmental concerns.  With the premiere of Living On Earth in                April 1991, public radio in the U.S. began serving its national                 audience with its first journalistically strong environmental                   show, Living On Earth.                                                                                                                                          Each week's edition of Living On Earth begins with a one minute                 billboard, followed by a five minute newscast summarizing                       national and world ecological and scientific developments.  The                 newscast includes modular breaks so that stations can insert two                minutes of local environmental news.                                                                                                                            The balance of each program is devoted to a theme, with produced                reports followed by a five minute newscast summarizing national                 and world ecological and scientific developments.  The newscast                 includes modular breaks so that stations can insert two minutes                 of local environmental news.                                                                                                                                    The balance of each program is devoted to a theme, with produced                reports followed by interviews, commentaries, and occasional                    humor.  From time to time the show is devoted to a full-length                  documentary or debate special.  Standards of thoroughness,                      fairness, and excellence result in shows that stimulate as well                 as inform.  Distributed by National Public Radio, the program is                available to more than 400 NPR stations in the U.S.  Already 160                of those stations have signed up to air the program.                                                                                                            Many environmental issues -- sustainable energy, population,                    biological degradation, sustainable economic development and                    pollution, for example -- are of global concern and cut across                  political, racial and cultural boundaries.  Material and                        information for Living On Earth is obtained from diverse                        producers and will be exchanged with public radio services                      around the world.   //",
