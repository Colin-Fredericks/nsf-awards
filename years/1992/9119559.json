 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed award is for the support of work over a three-year                 period.  There has been little interest in the fate of hydro-                   carbon contaminants in cold regions.  There has been limited                    research on water movement in such frozen soils as permafrost.                  Research on contaminant transport under freezing conditions has                 increased as interest in human activity in polar regions has                    increased.  The work has three components:  1) bench-scale                      studies of mechanisms affecting transport processes in ice and                  soil/ice systems; 2) field studies of two locations (one arctic,                the other antarctic) known to have experienced hydrocarbon                      contamination; and 3) development of a computer model to allow                  analysis and prediction of hydrocarbons in ice and ice/soil                     systems.  Spatial and temporal variation in soil matrices are                   important aspects of soil contaminant investigations.  Data                     collected in the physical bench-scale studies will serve as the                 underlying support for equation development and documentation of                the  exclusion  phenomenon.  Also, they will provide specific                   information on the effects of percent clay and silt, and on                     exclusion coefficients for the three components of the                          contaminant mixture (i.e., benzene,toluene and xylene).  Field                  study data will serve to calibrate and validate a transport                     model.  The research will extend current work being done by the                 Principal Investigators on modelling of hydrocarbon-groundwater                 interactions under freezing conditions.",
