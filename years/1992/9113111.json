 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtually all animals are both predators and potential prey for                 other animals.  Inherent in this truism are behavioral                          \"conflicts\" such as active feeding vs. minimizing exposure to                   predators.  Behavioral research focused on understanding these                  conflicts has revealed much about the nature of decision-making                 by animals.  Research on anti-predatory behavior has also yielded               considerable insight into the evolution of interactions among                   species and the workings of large-scale ecological systems.  It                 also promises to shed some light on human behavior, a perspective               deserving more attention from researchers.                                                                                                                      Dr. Lima is studying anti-predatory behavior in a social context.               Specifically, his research examines the (very common) group-based               systems for the early detection of predatory attack, and the                    problems that their very existence poses for evolutionary                       explanations of cooperative behavior.  Predator-detection systems               based upon the alertness (or vigilance) of individual group                     members suggest levels of cooperation that would not be expected                in supposedly selfish animals.  Nevertheless, such behavior is                  indeed observed.                                                                                                                                                Using a well-characterized bird species, the dark-eyed junco, Dr.               Lima will investigate a key, untested assumption underlying                     current attempts to explain this cooperation:  that group members               are in some way aware of the vigilance levels of their                          groupmates.  Examining this simple assumption will require a                    series of behavioral experiments performed under controlled                     environmental conditions.  Preliminary observations suggest that                these birds are actually not monitoring the behavior of their                   flockmates.  Should these observations be confirmed                             experimentally, then a major reassessment of our current                        understanding of widespread group-based predator-detection                      systems may well be in order.",
