 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds for a detailed study of the                   tectonic evolution and depositional history of Permian sedimentary              rocks on the Central Basin Platform, Permian Basin.  The Central                Basin Platform (CBP) is similar to other foreland uplifts.  The                 results from an integrated study of Permian sequence stratigraphic              relationships across the platform, geophysical data, and                        quantitative subsidence analyses will provide important information             about the tectonic origin and depositional history of this complex              structure.  This study also will present an unique intrabasinal                 test of sequence stratigraphic concepts.                                             The objectives of the proposed research are:  1) to determine              the late Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the CBP through detailed               analysis of pre-Leonardian structures and uplift history of the                 CBP; 2) to better constrain tectonic models for the origin of the               Permian Basin area; 3) to integrate structural analyses of the CBP              into larger-scale models of the tectonic evolution of the Marathon-             Ouachita foreland and the Ancestral Rocky Mountains; 4) to                      determine the Permian subsidence history along several east-west                transects across the CBP and adjacent parts of the Midland and                  Delaware Basins; 5) to determine the relative effects of                        subsidence, eustasy, sedimentation rate, and paleogeographic                    position of the evolution of Permian depositional facies from the               platform interior and across platform-to-basin transitions around               the CBP; 6) to identify the controls that pre-Premian structures                of the CBP have on Permian subsidence history and facies                        architecture; 7) to develop a better understanding of the origin                of foreland uplifts and their response to convergence events; and               8) to relate all the of the above objectives to future hydrocarbon              exploration and production strategies on the CBP.",
