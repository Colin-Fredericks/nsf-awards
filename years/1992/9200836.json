 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Award at                 North Carolina State University.  The funds provide support for                 seventeen undergraduate students selected from candidates from                  sixty five potential institutions in the Southeastern United                    States.  Participation consists of a summer session at North                    Carolina State University.  Special emphasis is placed upon                     recruitment from under-represented groups such as females and                   minorities.  Scholastic achievement is the primary requirement for              participation in the program, and recommendation by a faculty                   member is a significant factor.   The research under supervision of             faculty members will involve topics in the areas of super-                      resolution optical spectroscopy, compound semiconductors, atomic                collisions, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, supernova remnants, and              condensed matter theory.  The professors involved in this program               have a strong record of interaction with undergraduate students in              research.  The program has had considerable success in the past                 four years, for example, more than 24 publications with                         undergraduate student co-authors, several regional awards for                   student papers, and one winner of the Apker Award by the American               Institute of Physics for the outstanding undergraduate research                 project in the nation, plus an additional Apker finalist in 1991.",
