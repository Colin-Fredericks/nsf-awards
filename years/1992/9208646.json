 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Robertson's Mutator (Mu) transposable element system is a              highly active transposon system in maize that generates new                     mutations at frequencies of 50-fold over background.  The Mu system             has several unusual properties that distinguish it from other                   eukaryotic transposable element systems, and there is little known              regarding the mechanism of transposition of the Mu elements.  The               proposed studies are aimed towards a better understanding of this               transposon system at the molecular level.  We will characterize                 previously generated genetic material which show altered                        transposition properties as follows.  We plan to clone and                      characterize a derivative Mu element that heritable exhibits a 10               to 100 fold increase in excision frequency relative to the                      progenitor Mu1 element.  This element can be used to answer                     specific questions about Mu transposition, as well as providing a               sensitive marker for excision activity.  We will also analyze a Mu              lineage in which the transposon system was inactivated by continued             selfing, in order to understand the basis of dose-dependent                     regulation of Mu transposon activity.  In addition to the above                 studies, we will develop assays for Mu transposition in transgenic              dicotyledenous plants.  The assays will be used to determine the                sequence requirements for transposition, and the function of                    specific sequences within the Mu termini that we have previously                identified as likely to play an important role in transposition.                %%%                                                                             Due to the unusual properties of Mu transposons, these studies                  should add to our knowledge of mechanisms of transposition and DNA              re-arrangements.",
