 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will deal with two basic issues.  The first topic is               friction on microscopic scales.  In conjunction with the work on                electrostatic micro-motors, there has been an attempt made to                   characterize static friction in solid state devices using a                     structure etched into silicon.  This device is quite clever, and                results are providing new insight into friction on microscopic                  scales, but its application is limited to determination of static               friction coefficients for materials used on semiconductors.  Using              magnetically driven machines similar to those already being worked              with, the work can be extended to experimental determination of                 static and dynamic friction coefficients of various materials.  The             second basic topic is small scale bond yield strengths.  Virtually              all microelectronic devices are connected to packages via leads                 bonded to the periphery of the device, yet little is known about                the mechanical behavior of these bonds.  A database of bond                     stress/strain information is to be developed and the information                will be used to develop a predictive model of bond behavior.                    Preliminary work suggests that the size of any voids in the bond                should be able to be determined from force/displacement                         information.  This fundamental research will help  determine levels             of bond stress that are truly nondestructive, and should ultimately             permit the development of a nondestructive bond quality monitoring              machine for use in the manufacture of all miniature electronic and              electromechanical items.",
