 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project of this Presidential Faculty Fellow is in the              general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                     subfield of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  During              the two-year tenure of this award, Professor Shaka and his                      students will utilize innovative magic angle spinning, cross                    polarization, proton decoupling, and pulse sequence techniques to               obtain chemical information from NMR spectra that is                            characteristic of selected, local regions of samples.  This                     approach to materials characterization has broad applications in                such areas as organic solids and polymers, reactions at                         interfaces, isotopically doped porus materials, layered solids,                 and materials defects analysis.                                                 %%%                                                                             This Presidential Faculty Fellowship, which subsumes the final two              years of Professor Shaka's Presidential Young Investigator Award                (CHE-8957560), should significantly assist him in the continuing                development of his vital, innovative, and productive program of                 research and research training.",
