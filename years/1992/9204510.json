 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary area of research supported by this award is                    partial differential equations, especially those used to model                  wave phenomena.  Work includes the investigation of smoothing                   properties for a large class of linear and nonlinear dispersive                 evolution equations.  Dispersive waves are characterized by the                 property that the group velocity depends in a nontrivial way on                 the wave number.  An example would be Korteweg deVries equation.                The smoothing phenomenon refers to the observed behavior of                     solutions of certain equations - they are smoother than their                   initial conditions.  The approach to this work is the use of the                commutator method together with scattering theory.  One needs                   microlocal versions of Sobolev weighted norms to replace the                    standard norms which do not persist with time.  Other research                  directions include regularized determinants: the study of                       variational formulas for the regularized determinants of elliptic               operators on Riemannian manifolds of dimension two; global                      aspects of completely integrable Hamiltonian systems and the                    Schrodinger operator on tori and Heisenberg manifolds.                               Partial differential equations form the backbone of                        mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which                involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials                and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                     expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them and validate methods                         for expressing solutions.",
