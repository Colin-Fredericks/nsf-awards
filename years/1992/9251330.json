 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on laboratory                    experience in Advanced Methods in Human Computer Interaction                    including Multimedia, for undergraduate computer science                        students. Presently, a human computer interface course exists.                  It is primarily a lecture style course with limited hands-on                    work using conventional computing environments.  The world of                   human computer interaction has recently seen expansion in new                   innovative and multi-modal input/output devices (e.g., voice                    recognition, touch screen, multimedia, virtual reality                          environments) as opposed to traditional keyboard, display and                   mouse arrangements.  The equipment acquired in this project                     will provide students with the opportunity to use new dedicated                 hardware specifically developed for multimedia applications                     (the use of audio, voice, text and graphics).   The                             significance of the project is to provide a laboratory                          exploring new worlds of human computer interaction and to                       provide students the opportunity to explore these worlds using                  innovative devices on different hardware platforms in a                         supervised laboratory setting.",
