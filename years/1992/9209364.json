 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study the properties of complexed poly-                  hydroxybutyrate/calcium polyphosphate and non-covalently associated             proteins in planar lipid bilayers. There is preliminary evidence                that this membrane domain may be involved in calcium regulation,                based on spectrofluorometric studies in cell cultures and single                cells. The complex is widespread in prokaryotes and may be present              in mitochondria of eukaryotes. It is hypothesized to act by                     solvating polyanionic salts and forming ion-conducting complexes                which could result in the removal of calcium from the cell, with                simultaneous removal of phosphate. The voltage-dependent calcium                conductance of the complex from E. coli will be studied in planar               lipid bilayers. The cation selectivity and the action of channel                blocking agents will also be determined.                                        %%%                                                                             Bacteria contain large amounts of a complex of polyhydroxybutyrate              and calcium polyphosphate. The composition of this complex suggests             that the polyhydroxybutyrate could solvate polyanionic (negatively              charged) complexes and allow them to move through the helical                   channel which is thought to be formed, thus removing calcium and                polyphosphate from the interior to the exterior. This possibility               can be examined by putting the complex into a planar lipid bilayer,             which can be used as a model of the plasma membrane of cells, and               changing the conditions in the environment. The ionic composition               and the electrical charge applied will both be varied, and the                  effects of these variations will be assessed. It seems likely that              this complex is also present in higher organisms, and may function              in regulation of calcium. Since calcium concentration is very                   important in cellular function, these studies should be useful in               understanding a new mechanism for varying intracellular calcium.",
