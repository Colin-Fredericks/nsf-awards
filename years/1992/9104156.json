 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Thomas Duncan, a botanist at the University of                         California, Berkeley, has helped to establish an Association of                 California Herbaria, a network of 145 repositories in which                     representatives of California's plants are curated for research.                Dr. Duncan now plans to implement a regionally-connected database               of the plant specimens contained in these herbaria.  The flora of               California includes 25-30% of the plant species in the U.S., and                an unusually high percentage of rare and endemic species.                       California herbaria currently contain 7 million specimens, half                 of which were collected in the state.   The University of                       California, Berkeley, would serve as the Technical Coordinating                 Center for the effort, and Dr. Duncan has enlisted the active                   involvement of the University's Information Systems and                         Technology (IST) Department.  During the next two years, a                      prototype database will be established at Berkeley's University                 and Jepson Herbaria through data entry of approximately 80,000                  specimen records.                                                                    This pioneering effort will establish the first truly                      regional resources for managing biodiversity data.  It will                     provide a model for multi-institution collaborations, and will                  generate software with wide applicability.  The creation of this                shared database will facilitate rational planning for future                    collecting, research, and curation, and will support conservation               efforts.",
