 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of legal consciousness attempt to address questions about               the place and meaning of law in the lives of ordinary citizens.                 Until recently, two competing theoretical perspectives have                     dominated the scholarship on legal consciousness.  One school of                thought treats consciousness as the ideas and attitudes of                      individuals; from this perspective the meaning that people give to              law and the role that it plays in their lives is representative of              the ways that individuals create or shape the world around them.                A second school of thought holds that legal consciousness is a by-              product of the social institutions and structures that define                   peoples lives.  From this perspective, legal consciousness is the               product rather than the source of the world people find themselves              living in.  In recent years, a growing body of empirical studies                reject both the individual and structural conceptualizations of                 legal consciousness.  Instead, this school of thought views legal               consciousness as cultural practice that mediates between the                    individual and the social structure.  Consciousness evolves within              a framework of expectations about what is the normal and moral way              to act, what kinds of wrongs warrant action, and what kinds of                  remedies are acceptable and appropriate as well as probable and                 effective.  With this view, legal consciousness varies and changes              with local situations, norms and customary ways of doing things.                                                                                                Silbey will advance this cultural perspective theoretically,                    introducing a typology of legal consciousness, and exploring                    whether and how people express their ideas about law in ways that               are consonant with one or more of these typifications.  Also, the               project introduces a unique data set.  She uses indepth, face to                face, interviews with 300 persons in four New Jersey counties.                  The questions enable her to collect rich stories of troubles and                minor disruptions, as well as formal experiences with legal agents.             By combining this methodology with probability sampling, she will               be able to trace greater variation in legal consciousness among                 American citizens than has been achieved to date, including                     variations among African-American and Hispanic, as well as white                populations.  Finally, she introduces a unique, two stage plan of               analysis. Specifically, one phase  focuses on the analysis of                   discrete words while the second examines the thematic content of                the interview narratives.  Overall, the study will make substantial             contributions to the growing body of work on legal consciousness                by extending it demographically, methodologically, and                          theoretically.",
