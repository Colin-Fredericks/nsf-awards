The mathematical models to be                        devised will be based upon fundamental principles of                            surface chemistry and mass transfer.  Model parameters                          will be experimentally evaluated at laboratory-scale, and                       the models verified by conduct of field-scale research at                       the City of Durham, North Carolina's Williams Water                             Treatment Plant and at the Blacksburg-Christiansburg-                           Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Water                       Treatment Plant.                                                                                                                                                Results of this project are expected to provide a more                          fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which                            manganese in solution is removed from water by contact                          with filter media coated with the contaminant's oxide.                          This knowledge may be applied to improving the engineering                      design of water treatment processes for removal of soluble                      manganese.",
