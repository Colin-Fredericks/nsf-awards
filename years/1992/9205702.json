 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed toward the elucidation of intracellular                signalling pathways that involve calcium in the transduction of                 hormonal and environmental stimuli in higher plants.  The current               project focuses on the part of the signal transduction pathway that             involves the interaction between calcium and calmodulin, and the                consequent activation of specific target enzymes.  The preliminary              work for this project established the existence of four different               calmodulin isoforms encoded by at least six different genomic DNA               sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana.  This diversity of calmodulin              isoforms is unprecedented in either the plant or animal kingdoms,               and preliminary phylogenetic analyses suggest that this arrangement             may be unique to Arabidopsis or to the crucifer family.  These                  findings have led to the hypothesis that the different Arabidopsis              calmodulin isoforms have evolved to optimize the interaction of                 calmodulin with specific target enzymes, particularly target                    enzymes associated with membranes.                                              %%%                                                                                This project is directed toward intracellular signal                         transduction pathways in higher plants.  At present, there is only              a general understanding of these processes in the plant kingdom.                The preliminary data demonstrate the existence of multiple isoforms             of the calcium-binding elicitor protein, calmodulin, in Arabidopsis             thaliana.  This unexpected result may underlie significant                      differences between plants and other organisms in the mechanisms of             signal reception and transduction.",
