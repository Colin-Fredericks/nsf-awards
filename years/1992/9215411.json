 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this project is to advance the state of                      knowledge in robustly representing, interrogating and manipulating              the geometry of complex objects using imprecise/discrete computer               arithmetic and developing the necessary theory and algorithms which             can form the basis for CAD/CAM systems of the future.  This theory              will involve primarily concepts of interval arithmetic and                      conditioning from numerical analysis as well as concepts of                     stability from differential topology, of simplicial complex theory              from algebraic topology, and basic concepts of differential                     geometry, all applied in computational geometry representations and             algorithms.                                                                          Specific objectives are:  To analyze how interval non-uniform              rational B-spline curves and surface patches can be used to obtain              robust machine realizations of flexible free-form boundaries for                solids in a modeling system for complex objects.  To develop                    methods which allow stable Boolean operations.  To investigate how              local stability properties of adjacencies resulting from Boolean                operations.  To investigate how local stability properties of                   adjacencies resulting from Boolean operations can be integrated in              a global topological generalized Boundary Representation cell-                  tuple structure, so as to obtain consistent geometric results which             remain compatible with a variable numerical resolution.  To obtain              a reliable classification of cases where the resulting information              of the system is uncertain and those cases where the answer is                  specific.",
