The purpose of the meeting is to develop a research             design for a collaborative, transnational data collection project               on the subject of the relationship between legal socialization and              legal/political change.  The impetus for developing a research                  design was a conference on legal socialization held in March, 1991,             in Paris, France.  Preliminary discussions about a research design              were held at the Law and Society Annual Meeting in Amsterdam, but               the schedule did not provide sufficient time to develop a full                  fledged research design.  It is still necessary to review and reach             agreement on a number of theoretical and methodological issues.                 This planning meeting will include presentations, intensive                     discussion time, and provision for specific drafting tasks.  The                project meets all of the objectives of the special competition on               \"Global Perspectives on Sociolegal Studies.\"",
