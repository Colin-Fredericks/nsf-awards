 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops econometric methods that do not rely on the               correct specification of the structure of economic models for                   their validity.  This is an extremely important line of research                because these methods permit empirical research to concentrate on               drawing economic inferences from data without risking potentially               large specification errors.  The basic idea is to replace the                   structural model with an approximation that sequentially improves               as more information becomes available.  The methods developed by                this project permit reliable inference at each intermediate stage               of model evolution.  The procedures are general enough to                       encompass most econometric inference procedures.  Under a                       previous grant the investigator succeeded in developing                         statistical methods that have certain advantages particularly                   relevant to econometric applications: simplicity, ease of                       implementation, and ease of extension to nonlinear, multivariate,               and time series applications.  Under this grant these methods                   will be extended to a dynamic setting and used to analyze                       financial markets.  As in the past, algorithms implementing the                 theoretical and empirical work will be coded and documented to                  current standards for professionally written, scientific software               and put in the public domain.                                                                                                                                   The methods developed under this project are termed                             seminonparametric (SNP) methods because they are parametric yet                 have nonparametric properties.  The procedures replace the                      structure models with a truncated series expansion, the error                   density with a truncated expansion, or both.  By letting the                    truncation grow adaptively with sample size, the approximation is               accurate enough at each intermediate stage to permit reliable                   inference and ultimate convergence to the underlying data                       generating mechanism.  Applications are made to conditionally                   heterogeneous time series such as occur in finance and                          macroeconomics.  Bayesian methods are also studied.",
