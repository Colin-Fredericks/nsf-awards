 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many mating systems, females mate repeatedly during a                   reproductive period.  Under such conditions, mate choice may                    involve two distinct phases:  initial mate selection and                        subsequent female fidelity.  When males provide parental care,                  natural selection should favor female mate preferences that                     result in higher offspring fitness.  However, at the beginning of               a reproductive period, females cannot directly assess offspring                 fitness, and so may choose mates based on indicators of potential               offspring fitness.  Once the initial mate selection has been                    made, females should be able to assess offspring fitness directly               by monitoring the survival of offspring resulting from previous                 matings.                                                                             This research will involve a detailed study of female mate                 choice in the bicolor damselfish, Stegastes partitus, a coral                   reef fish in which males provide exclusive parental care of eggs.               The objectives of this study are to (1) establish the connection,               if any, between the initial female choice of a character and the                fitness consequences to offspring of the female preference, (2)                 manipulate the character to establish causality, (3) determine                  whether subsequent mating decisions are more strongly influenced                by direct information on offspring fitness, and (4) manipulate                  the cue to determine whether female responses do indeed increase                subsequent offspring fitness.  The research represents one of the               first fully integrated studies of mating dynamics.",
