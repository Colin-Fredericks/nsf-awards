 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ribosomes play a key role in the synthesis of proteins in all                 living cells, whether they be plant cells, animal cells, or                     bacteria.  In eukaryotes, these complex giant macromolecules are                composed of four kinds of ribosomal RNA molecules and approximately             eighty different ribosomal proteins.  Ribosome assembly occurs in               the nucleolus of the cell, where three of the four RRNAS are                    synthesized.  All other components of the ribosome are synthesized              elsewhere and transported to the nucleolus for assembly.  This                  research project is focused on identifying and characterizing the               transport pathways and regulatory mechanisms that bring the 5S                  ribosomal RNA to the nucleolus for assembly into ribosomes.  The                research will use mutants of the cloned 5S RNA genes and their                  associated proteins to try to disrupt normal ribosome assembly or               function in order to discern how each component might function in               normal ribosome assembly.  The mutated genes or their gene products             (5S RNAs or 5S RNA-binding proteins) will be microinjected in                   Xenopus oocytes, and the gene products will be followed through the             cell by way of the radioisotopic labelling and/or specific                      antibodies against the protein or nucleoprotein components.  In                 vitro exchange studies will be carried out with isolated nucleoli               and with isolated ribosomes, and the results will be verified in                vivo through the microinjection experiments.                                    %%%                                                                             Protein synthesis is a fundamental process of all living cells.                 The machinery for protein synthesis is the ribosome, a complex                  structure consisting of many individual macromolecular components,              both proteins and polyribonucleic acids (RNAs).  The synthesis of               ribosomes is a complex process, since the synthesis of the                      individual macromolecular components occurs in various parts of the             cell, and sometimes at different times, yet it is necessary to                  bring all the different components together for assembly.  The                  protein components of the ribosome are themselves synthesized on                preexisting ribosomes, and this takes place in the cytoplasm.  The              ribonucleic acids are synthesized in the nucleus, since they are                direct transcripts of the ribosomal genes.  Three of the four RNA               molecules are synthesized in a specialized region of the nucleus                termed the nucleolus, first as a very long transcript which is                  processed into the three smaller pieces.  It is to the nucleolus                that all the other components are brought for assembly, including               the fourth and smallest RRNA molecule, termed \"5S.\"  This 5S RNA is             synthesized in the nucleus, but not in the nucleolus.  Prior                    results from this laboratory have shown that, in Xenopus oocytes,               the 5S RNA is synthesized in advance of the other RRNA components,              and that after the 5S RNA is transcribed it is transported to the               cytoplasm, together with its own transcription factor (a protein                termed TFIIIA), and is stored there.  Subsequently, it becomes                  dissociated from TFIIIA and associates with a different protein,                L5, which is a ribosomal protein; the 5S RNA-L5 complex is then                 transported back to the nucleus, specifically now to the nucleolus,             where it becomes assembled into the nascent ribosomes.  This                    project will address the mechanism and regulation of this                       complicated nucleocytoplasmic trafficking.  The work is of                      significance not only for understanding ribosomal biogenesis, which             is itself a very important problem in biology, but also for                     understanding nucleocytoplasmic trafficking in general, which as a              phenomenon is fundamental to much of eukaryotic cellular                        regulation.",
