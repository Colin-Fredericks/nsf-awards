 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator intends to consider ramifications and                     applications of a result he has recently proved, namely that a K-               theory can be defined for any triangulated category in such a way               that the K-theory of the bounded derived category of an abelian                 category A agrees with the K-theory of A.                                            Although this project is highly algebraic, one motivation lies             in its potential for reducing geometric information to a subject                for calculation by perfecting one of the principal algebraic tools              used for this purpose.  The nature of the geometric information                 involved is the crux of the difficulty.  While questions about                  lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to              be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what are known             as topological properties of geometric objects.  These are                      properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),                      knottedness, having no holes, and so forth.  All systematic study               of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric              objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are              only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of                 differences that can occur, all these have only truly been                      comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of             calculation.  Algebraic K-theory has been developed into a major                tool for this purpose, and the interplay between the algebra and                the topology involved remains a fascinating subject.",
