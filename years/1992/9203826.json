Using neutron                       activation, sherds selected by Chinese archaeologists will be                   analyzed at the University of Wisconsin reactor facility. This                  analysis will provide quantitative information on interaction                   spheres of the communities along the river system from the most                 critical time of development of civilized society in east Asia.                                                                                                 Archaeological science in China is in its formative stages.  This               collaboration will contribute to advancing this science through                 application of new techniques not yet widely used in China.                     Through this cooperation, US scientists will also gain access to                important archaeological sites, and to future discoveries                       anticipated in China.  Results of this research may shed light on               the complex interactions and trade relations in a period of early               Chinese civilization dating from the mid- to early second                       millennium BC.",
