 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a renewal for the existing grant entitled                      \"Evaluating the Effects of High Particulate Fluxes at the Amazon                River/Ocean Boundary,\" which is part of the AmasSeds (A Multi-                  Disciplinary Amazon Shelf SEDiment Study) Project.  Three research              cruises to the Amazon shelf (August 1989; February, 1990; and May               1990; and November, 1991) have been completed successfully.  Time               series approach to understanding the chemical, physical, and                    geological processes active at the Amazon River/ocean boundary                  enables the investigators to resolve the variable influences of                 river discharge, tidal resuspension, local wind stress, and the                 intensity of coastal currents on particle-associated processes.                 The specific topics of research described in this proposal include:             1) evaluating the effects of suspended sediment concentration on                the biological uptake and regeneration of nutrients and carbon; 2)              the release of radium isotopes to the water column from particles               and sediments and their use in tracking seabed/water column                     exchange processes; 3) scavenging of particle-reactive elements                 from continental shelf waters; 4) uranium cycling during                        river/ocean mixing; and 5) tracing biological and physical                      processes on the Amazon shelf based on the distribution of carbon               and stable isotopic data.  Measurements of radioactive tracers in               the water column and seabed enable investigators to characterize                many of these processes on a variety of time scales (ranging from               days to hundreds of years).  This proposal requests support for two             additional years of research, which will be used to complete data               analyses, work up individual data sets, model the initial results,              and integrate the field measurements with the other research groups             taking part in the project.",
