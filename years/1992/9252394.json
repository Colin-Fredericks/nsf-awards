It is believed that these freshmen                   can learn much and be motivated by studying equipment and                       devices that have been \"opened up\" for viewing and testing.                     The lab presently contains pieces of state-of-the-art                           communications, computing, and measuring equipment, such as:                    telephones; radio and television receivers; VCR and CD players;                 an ultrasonic focusing system designed for an instant camera;                   and fiber optic communication links.  Inexpensive commercial                    multi-experiment electronic kits are also available.  This                      grant provides the equipment needed to study the performance of                 these systems, together with several specialized one-of-a-kind                  setups.                                                                                                                                                         The course of which the lab is a part was constructed in a                      modular fashion to permit its being used in EECS by other                       instructors and at other schools, and, with changes, in other                   fields of engineering.  In particular, it is expected that the                  course will be tested in all eight schools of the NSF coalition                 (\"Synthesis:  The NSF Engineering Education Coalition\") -- Cal                  (Berkeley), Cal Poly (San Luis Obispo), Cornell, Hampton, Iowa                  State, Southern University, Stanford, and Tuskegee Institute.",
