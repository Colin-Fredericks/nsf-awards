 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide renewed support for the Science and                     Technology Center for Photoinduced Charge Transfer. All of the                  Center research projects will be jointly directed by University                 of Rochester faculty members and researchers from the Eastman                   Kodak Company and/or Xerox Corporation.  The research will be                   concerned primarily with providing answers to three fundamental                 questions: What are the structural, environmental and energetic                 factors that control the fundamental rates and efficiencies of                  electron transfer, charge separation and charge transport?  How                 can these factors be manipulated to obtain new chemistry and                    useful reaction products? How can new materials and devices be                  developed for photochemically based technology?  The various                    Center research projects will investigate photoinduced charge                   transfer in a wide variety of chemical systems, including                       gas-phase clusters, homogeneous solutions, organized assemblies                 such as Langmuir-Blodgett films, solids, and across interfaces.                 Each project will make use of a wide variety of skills, usually                 drawn from more than one branch of science.  Synthetic organic                  chemistry will be used to build new molecules with particular                   photochemical properties, and complex systems will be assembled                 using a variety of methods, including surface science, polymer                  science and molecular biology. All the systems under study will                 be characterized using modern spectroscopy and other tools of                   physical chemistry, including state-of-the-art, ultrafast laser                 techniques.  Theoretical studies will be an important component                 of the research, with theory being used in several projects to                  both guide and interpret experiments.                                           %%%                                                                             Photoinduced charge transfer is of intense current interest to                  researchers in several disciplines and is the basis of imaging                  science and technology.  The participation of Kodak and Xerox                   researchers in the Center provides an effective conduit for                     technology transfer, and some of the basic research findings of                 Center projects have already been put into practical use at                     Kodak and Xerox. The Center provides an excellent environment                   for multidisciplinary training of graduate students and                         undergraduates, and the Center has also been the site of a                      summer research program for high school teachers.  Center                       researchers have also designed and built a low-cost scanning                    tunnelling microscope which will be manufactured for use in                     college and high school laboratories and in the training of                     industrial researchers in the use of this type of instrument.",
