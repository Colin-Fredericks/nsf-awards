 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will suppose that R is a commutative two-                    dimensional Noetherian ring.  The primary projects in this proposal             are:  (1) characterize the partially ordered set of prime ideals for            various examples of such rings; and  (2) suppose that the ring R                has the additional property that there exist only finitely many                 finitely generated indecomposable R-modules up to local                         isomorphism.  Describe the indecomposable modules of R.                               This work in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry                   will examine the lattice structure of the set of prime ideals in the            Noetherian ring.                                                                      The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                    opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:  short             visits by other prominent women mathematicians; meetings with                   women graduate students in mathematics; teaching courses and                    participating in seminars.",
