 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary focus of this research program is the quantitative                  investigation of the detailed mechanisms responsible for                        conversion of fuel carbon into highly symmetrical, low entropy                  fullerene compounds in flames.  The project includes three                      main components: combustion experiments, molecular orbital                      modeling, and kinetic modeling.  In the combustion                              experiments, laboratory data on rates of production and                         consumption of fullerenes, fullerene precursors, and other                      species and flame parameters will be collected.  The flame                      properties to be measured include profiles of concentrations                    of stable species, fullerenes, fullerene intermediates, and                     polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) along with OH radicals                   and temperature through a low-pressure premixed flat flame;                     these measurements will be made at various operating                            pressures, cold-gas velocities, and feed compositions.  Some                    key intermediates involved in fullerene production will not be                  experimentally observable due to their transient nature, so                     their thermodynamic properties will be estimated using                          molecular orbital modeling methods.  This information will                      then be used in the last component of the program,  mechanism                   development and kinetic modeling, along with the measured                       profiles, for development of a coherent, quantitative                           explanation of the steps involved in fullerene production,                      leading to definition of strategies for optimization of                         fullerene production via combustion synthesis.                                                                                                                  Considerable interest in fullerenes (also referred to                           sometimes as the third form of carbon, alongside graphite and                   diamond), has developed over the past few years.  Potential                     uses for these compounds are just beginning to be defined;                      such definition and subsequent actual utilization are limited                   by a lack of material with which to work and its                                extraordinarily high price.  Combustion synthesis of                            fullerenes offers a potentially attractive route (alternative                   to the currently more widely used electric arc method of                        fullerene production) for cost and scale-up reasons.  Thus,                     development of an understanding of how fullerenes are formed                    in flames, leading to optimization (in terms of operating                       parameters and apparatus configuration) of combustion                           synthesis of these materials, is of major interest.",
