 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seasonal drifting pack ice covers vast regions of the Southern                  Ocean.  The biota in pack ice are found throughout the ice floes,               and this has been attributed to the harvesting and concentration                of organisms from the water during frazil ice formation.  The                   frequent formation of frazil ice and the concentration of                       organisms in newly-forming ice is one of the fundamental                        differences between the pack ice and the land fast ice habitats.                During the autumn to winter transitional light levels and                       atmospheric temperatures decrease and a considerable amount of                  seasonal sea ice forms.  Organisms incorporated into ice floes                  during this season will be subjected to low temperature, high in                situ salinities and low light.  This project will examine the                   process of the incorporation of organisms into ice to determine                 if selection occurs, if organisms survive and if some organisms                 form resting stages as a means for insuring overwinter survival.                This is part of an international, multidisciplinary study of the                pack ice system.  This project will be a key part of the                        collaboration, which focuses on biological, physical and chemical               processes during the autumn ice-forming season.",
