It will be held at the Technical University of                 Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain, organized in cooperation with the                  Northwestern University Center for Advanced Cement-Based                        Materials, and held under the auspices of RILEM.  (International                Union of the Research Laboratories in Materials and Structures,                 Paris).  The aim of the symposium is to appraise the state-of-                  the-art and set directions for new research.  It will facilitate                an interdisciplinary dialogue between scientists working in                     materials science, continuum mechanics, structural engineering                  and concrete technology, and will stimulate new developments and                areas of research in the field.  The symposium will result in an                authoritative high quality proceedings volume which will serve as               a basic reference on the subject of creep and shrinkage of                      concrete.",
