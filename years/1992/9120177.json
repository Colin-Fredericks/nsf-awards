 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interior of the cells is electronegative respect to the                     extracellular media.  However, against the natural tendency of                  the positively charged Na and Ca ions to accumulate into the                    cells, they are much more concentrated in the external side.  To                maintain that situation a net steady Na and Ca extrusion must                   take place while energy is consumed.  For Ca, two proteins                      located in the plasma membrane cooperate to that end: (i) the Ca                pump, which uses energy from ATP hydrolysis, and (ii) the Na/Ca                 exchange which, though it takes that energy from the inward Na                  gradient, is also stimulated by ATP.  The studies will                          characterize the structure-function relationships of the Na/Ca                  exchanger employing the squid giant axon.  Under dialysis, this                 preparation is unique for it allows almost complete biochemical                 control of intra and extracellular environments and also of the                 transmembrane electrical potential.  Answers to the following                   specific questions can be expected to provide an increase in our                understanding of how extraordinary electrochemical barriers to                  their movements.  (i) Is ATP stimulation is exerted directly on                 the exchanger or are other structures, perhaps kinases, involved?               (ii) What amino acids (structural units of proteins) are relevant               to the functions of the exchanger?  In this case compounds known                to selectively block different amino acids or chemical groups                   will be used. The physiological relevance of the Ca extruding                   systems is evidenced by the fact that intracellular \u0131Ca!                        regulated blood flow and pressure and neural and endocrine                      functions.",
