 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Garth Sampson and                  his colleagues will conduct archaeological and paleoenvironmental               research in the Zeekoe valley region in South Africa. The goal of               the work is to examine the relationship between environmental                   change and the response of humans who live at a simple                          technological level. Potsherds collected in the course of prior                 archaeological research in the region will be dated by both                     thermolumenescence and radiocarbon dating of adhering organic                   materials. Changing paleoenvironment will be reconstructed                      through the analysis of hyrax dung middens. This latter is a                    technique pioneered by Dr. Sampson. Hyrax are small territorial                 animals who return over generations to favored habitation sites.                Resultant dung middens can span centuries and can be dated by                   radiocarbon. Because the contained material includes pollen                     grains, these latter can be analyzed to provide insight into                    changing climatic conditions. With these data Dr. Sampson will be               able to correlate environmental cause and human response.                                                                                                       For many years Dr. Sampson and his collaborators have worked in                 the Zeekoe valley region. Thousands of sites have been located                  and studied and the general chronology and sequence of events                   have been established. Over the period from about 600 - 1800 AD                 this region was most likely inhabited by two groups, one which                  subsisted by hunting and gathering and the other by herding sheep               and goats. The interactions between the two appear to be complex                and changing over time. When European settlers entered the region               in the 1800s they encountered only hunters and gatherers there.                 While the pattern has been established, its cause is unknown and                this is the focus of Dr. Sampsons' present work. The Zeekoe is a                semiarid region which has undergone significant climatic                        fluxuation in historic times and likely in prehistory as well.                                                                                                  This research is important for several reasons. It will increase                our understanding of how humans adapt to changing climate and how               groups at a simple level of technological development relate to                 each other in a varying environmental context.",
