 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Frank Hole, Ms Lucinda McWeeney will                 collect data for her doctoral dissertation thesis.  She will                    extract cores from archaeological and geological sites to obtain                macroflora - small preserved plant remains, and analyze these as                well as materials already in hand. All sites are located in                     Southern New England and together span the time period from late                in the last glacial period, ca 14,000 years ago, to recent times.               On this basis, it should be possible to reconstruct vegetation                  response to the northward retreat of the last glaciers as well as               more recent climatic fluctuations.  The results of this                         reconstruction  will be integrated with archaeological data to                  examine how Native American populations at different periods of                 time responded to, and were affected by climatic change.                                                                                                        In particular, Ms McWeeney will examine three specific issues.                  The first involves the earliest paleoindian hunters and gatherers               in North America.  What were the environmental challenges which                 they faced and what resources were available to these first human               colonists in the New World?  Secondly, a major change in                        lifestyle took place in the late Archaic period when settlement                 in New England shifted to riverine locations and a number of new                stone tool forms appeared in the archeological record.                          Archaeologists don't know whether these changes are due to an                   influx of new peoples or represent an in situ adaptation to a                   changing environment.  Finally, in comparison to other parts of                 North America, maize agriculture was adopted relatively late in                 New England and it is unclear what role climatic limitations may                have played in this delayed spread.  Ms McWeeney's research will                help to answer this question.                                                                                                                                   This research is important for several reasons.  While it is                    clear that human populations are influenced by and may actively                 respond to environmental change, the details of this interaction                are not well understood.  Because of its long archaeological                    record and the presence, at different times, of groups with                     varying levels of technical expertise, New England provides an                  excellent context to examine this question.  Much archaeological                data exists but the environmental context is not well                           established.  Ms McWeeney's research will help to remedy this.                  This work will also assist in the training of a very promising                  young scientist.",
