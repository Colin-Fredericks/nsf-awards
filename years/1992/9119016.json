 "awd_abstract_narration": "These experiments will examine the basal ganglia, a part of the                 brain which controls movement.  In the brain nerve cells form                   connections with each other and transmit to one another information             that is determined partially by the chemicals contained within                  them.  However, the ability of the brain in adult mammals to repair             itself following injury or disease is limited and not well                      understood.  One response of nerve cell death in the basal ganglia              is that the surviving cells appear to reorganize.  In other words,              the nerve cells form new connections with cells they do not                     normally communicate with.  The goal of Dr. Roberts research is to              develop anatomical techniques that will allow her to identify the               cells that form these new connections.  In addition, Dr. Roberts                will determine the chemical composition of these cells following                nerve cell loss.  These experiments which will characterize the                 surviving nerve cells, will provide clues as to the functional                  impact of these changes and may begin to explain the elements                   necessary for repair and recovery in the brain after the injury.",
