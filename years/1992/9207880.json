 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two specific objectives will be pursued during the proposed                   project period.  The first will be expression of the full length                clone, pCGS11N, which contains the coding information for avian                 liver glutamine synthetase, in expression vectors such as pKK223 or             various derivatives thereof.  Of special concern will be a                      characterization of the expression product, especially its                      conformation.  Preliminary results indicate the expression product              may aggregate.  Since this is likely to render it import-                       incompetent, conditions that prevent aggregation and also keep the              protein in an unfolded configuration will be established.  The                  second major objective will be to establish an in vitro system in               which glutamine synthetase is imported into isolated mitochondria.              If necessary, the original technique of presenting isolated                     mitochondria with freshly translated synthetase will be used,                   although the use of the pure expression product is now preferable               and is required to establish species- and tissue-specific cytosolic             import factors.                                                                 %%%                                                                             Seventy-five percent of land vertebrates utilize a uricotelic-type              mechanism for detoxifying ammonia formed during hepatic amino acid              catabolism.  Ammonia, formed via the glutamate dehydrogenase                    reaction, is converted by glutamine synthetase to the amide                     function of glutamine which then exits to the cytosol where it is               utilized for uric acid synthesis.  In the ureotelic mechanism,                  utilized by mammals and some adult amphibians, ammonia is converted             to citrulline in the mitochondria, which then exits to the cytosol              to be converted to urea.  What these two pathways have in common is             that in each case, the ammonia-detoxifying mechanisms are directed              toward converting ammonia formed in the mitochondrial matrix to a               form that does not bind protons during transit of the inner                     mitochondrial membrane and therefore does not uncouple oxidative                phosphorylation.  What is particularly interesting is that, in                  ureotelic vertebrates (e.g., mammals), the enzyme glutamine                     synthetase is only found in the cytosol, never in the mitochondria,             whereas in the uricotelic sauropsid vertebrates (reptiles and                   birds) the enzyme is localized to mitochondria in the liver but is              cytosolic in other tissues such as neural tissue.  A putative                   mitochondrial targeting sequence in the avian enzyme, not present               in the mammalian enzyme, has been identified.  However, the primary             amino acid sequences of the avian liver (mitochondrial) and neural              tissue (cytosolic) forms are identical, raising the question of how             the differential targeting occurs.  This project aims to understand             the molecular events responsible for targeting of the enzyme in                 sauropsids.  The work is of considerable interest from biochemical,             cell biological, physiological, and evolutionary perspectives.",
