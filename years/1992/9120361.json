 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical Studies of Anyon Superconductivity - The occurrence of              fractional statistics in nature (anyons)-, the capacity of                      fractional statistics to cause superconductivity, and the natural               appearance of fractional statistics in formal descriptions of                   strongly correlated model systems (e.g., the Hubbard and t-J                    models) are now firmly established.  As a result, anyon pairing                 must be accepted as a potential case for high-Tc superconductivity.             As yet unclear is whether anyonic superconductivity actually occurs             in these (or indeed any) real materials.  This question will remain             open until mathematical tools sufficiently powerful to describe                 anyonic effects both accurately and correctly are developed.  The               proposed research includes both the development of formal                       procedures, based on perturbative techniques, to describe anyonic               superconductivity in realistic settings, and the use of these                   procedures for computation of spectroscopic properties of high-Tc               materials.                                                                      %%%                                                                             This work is intended to develop an accurate picture of anyonic                 superconductivity, that is, superconductivity whose elementary                  objects are pairs of odd-fractioned spin entities, rather than the              paired electrons which produce normal superconductive phenomena.                This new form of superconductivity is important in itself, but is               also a plausible model for the recently-discovered phenomenon of                high-Tc superconductivity.  The central feature of the present                  work is the development and application of mathematical machinery               suitable for detailed discussion of this phenomenon.",
