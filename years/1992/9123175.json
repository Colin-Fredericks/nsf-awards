 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on a membrane process                      of for oxygenation of water.  The research involves                             evaluation of the mass transfer characteristics of                              vertically oriented hollow fibers, arranged in packets,                         and within which an atmosphere of pure oxygen is                                maintained.  The oxygen is transferred to the                                   horizontally-flowing fluid through the fiber walls without                      the formation of bubbles as is characteristic of                                conventional oxygenation processes.  This concept has a                         potential for providing the required amount of respiratory                      oxygen at a rate that is consistent with the biochemical                        oxygen demand of the bioprocess without the loss of                             efficiency that is characteristic of oxygenation processes                      that depend on oxygen-transfer from a rising or                                 circulating pattern of bubbles.                                                                                                                                 Submerged-culture, biological processes for treatment of                        wastewaters depend upon an adequate movement of oxygen                          into the reaction vessel to maintain a high rate of                             aerobic, biological activity.  Applications of the concept                      expected to emerge from this research also include                              bringing effluents from wastewater treatment processes up                       to levels consistent with maintenance of good levels of                         oxygen in receiving streams, in maintaining desired levels                      of oxygen in ice-covered lakes, and in compensating for                         loss of oxygen during use of hydropower in the  generation                      of electricity.",
