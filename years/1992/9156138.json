 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project engages students in learning through the use of                     writing groups, in which small groups of students work together                 throughout the course to: 1) develop their oral and written                     communication skills; 2) incorporate small-group experiences                    into large courses; and 3) expand the students' understanding                   of the nature and methods of geology. Innovative writing                        assignments and associated small group activities supplement                    lectures in Physical and Historical Geology courses. The                        writing assignments develop observational and critical-thinking                 skills, introduce students to the practice of geology today,                    and foster awareness of the role of geology in society. As                      students meet to review each others' papers, they develop their                 oral and written communication skills, learn to use technical                   language precisely, discuss interpretations, and evaluate                       arguments. Teaching assistants, trained undergraduate geology                   majors, monitor the group work, respond to and evaluate the                     short papers and participate in small-group activities.",
