 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet today has evolved from a model based on a hierarchy                to one mainly based on a richly interconnected mesh.  Due to this               change in topology, in addition to the exponential growth the                   Internet is currently experiencing, there exists a dire need for                new protocols that support both the ability to route traffic                    based on policy (PB) and/or type of service (TOS) and the ability               to scale well with respect to the memory, computational, and                    bandwidth resources necessary to provide for adaptive routing of                traffic.  This proposal addresses these requirements by combining               the best of three current routing protocols.  The Border Gateway                Protocol (BGP) was first implemented on the NSFNET backbone as a                direct response to the need for a new exterior gateway protocol                 in the late 1980s to handle the increase in size of the Internet                and the non-hierarchical peering that was beginning to appear.                  It is based on a path-vector routing model which uses static                    routes with accompanying policies per network and is intended for               use with IP-based networks. It is currently being adapted and                   implemented by major routing vendors in their products.  The                    Inter Domain Routing Protocol (IDRP) is BGP with additional                     capabilities and adapted for use in the OSI world using CLNP.                   IDRP is very close to passing its last international standards                  vote and will then be an ISO/CCITT standard.  Its emergence will                be very helpful in the deployment of U.S. GOSIP compliant                       networks.   The Inter Domain Policy Routing (IDPR) is a model                   that allows for the pre-selection of the networks a packet will                 transit based on the policies and TOS supported by the transit                  networks in addition to the policies or TOS required by the                     source.  This capability is one that many Federal agencies need                 in order to select network paths based on security, cost factors,               guaranteed bandwidth for multi-media and real time experimental                 control, in addition to providing the agencies with the tools                   necessary for implementing their acceptable use policies.  The                  IDPR uses dynamic installation of routes to accomplish its goals.               The combination of BGP, IDRP, and IDPR would provide the best of                all worlds. Economy of resources would be gained using the                      aggregation features found in BGP/IDRP, thereby reducing routing                table sizes, reducing the computational cycles required to                      calculate routes, and the bandwidth necessary for transmitting                  the routing information. In addition, the flexibility found in                  IDPR, required to handle special cases such as those defined by                 the federal agencies, and both quality of service and type of                   service support will be provided.  This proposal aims at building               on the currently deployed infrastructure and protocols in a                     manner that would not require a mass scale replacement of current               technologies and equipment, and therefore provide for a phased                  evolution to an Internetwork with enhanced capabilities.",
