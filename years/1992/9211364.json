 "awd_abstract_narration": "Democratic nations are involved in hostilities and wars about as                often as non-democratic nations.  However, hostilities and wars                 between democracies are rare events.  A fundamental proposition has             emerged to explain why democracies rarely engage in hostile acts                with one another.  Namely, contending democratic nations avoid war              with one another by successfully employing mediation and other                  efforts of third parties to resolve or ameliorate conflicts between             them.                                                                                                                                                           The goal of this research is to investigate the impact of                       democratic governance on the use of conflict management techniques              and peaceful settlement in approximately 250 postwar interstate                 security disputes.  It represents the first attempt to subject this             fundamental proposition to direct empirical investigation.  The                 researcher will begin by developing an integrated data base drawing             together diverse information on interstate disputes and their                   outcomes, attributes of contending parties in the disputes, any                 third parties seeking amelioration, and specific actions taken by               both disputants and third parties.  Using these data, the                       researcher will construct and estimate a theoretical model                      incorporating democracy as a factor promoting the use of conflict               management techniques and then, focus on more complex models of how             democracy works in conjunction with conflict management techniques              in the peaceful settlement of disputes.  The final phase of the                 project involves post-hoc examination of selected disputes in a                 series of comparative case studies. These stages of inquiry assure              that the proposition about why democracies rarely engage in wars                with one another is rigorously tested.",
