 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Laurentide Ice Sheet was the largest of the Northern                   Hemisphere ice sheets that developed during the last glacial                    maximum.  An accurate reconstruction of this ice sheet has                      significant implications for late Quaternary paleoclimatic                      reconstructions, including interpreting global sea-level history.               A significant point of debate concerning the dynamics and form of               the Laurentide Ice Sheet involves specifying whether the dominant               mechanism of ice movement was internal deformation, sliding,                    subglacial sediment deformation, or some combination of these.                  The fundamental question is whether rigid-bed processes, such as                sliding, or soft-bed processes, particularly pervasive                          deformation, were dominant.  This project will attempt to answers               this question by developing aa numerical model of the ice-till                  dynamics of the Lake Michigan Lobe during the last glacial                      maximum.  Parameters for sediment rheology derived from                         geotechnical analyses of glacial sediment will form the basis of                the model, and they will be integrated with an examination of the               sediment record and sediment transport fluxes of the lobe with                  respect to its dynamics.  The model will test the deforming bed                 versus sliding hypotheses through a quantitative assessment of                  the physical conditions under which sediment deformation could or               could not have occurred beneath the Lake Michigan Lobe.                              The results of this research will have significant                         implications for understanding and modeling the dynamics of ice                 sheets as well as for interpreting the origin of massive,                       homogeneous till units in mid-latitude regions.  Understanding                  the dynamics and behavior of an ice sheet during its decay is                   important for constraining potential behavior of modern ice                     sheets.",
