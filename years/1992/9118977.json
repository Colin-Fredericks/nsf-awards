Specifically, this                 research will focus on providing a detailed description of the                  mechanism of action of the protein Id, a molecule shown to                      inhibit the differentiation process in multiple cell lineages.                  The main model system that will be sued to study Id activity is                 the muscle differentiation pathway in which Id has been shown to                antagonize the action of the muscle determination gene MyoD. 1)                 The regions of the Id protein molecule required for its activity                will be determined by site directed mutagenesis followed by                     functional analysis in transfection assays. Both the ability of                 Id to inhibit myogenesis and its ability to overcome the growth                 suppressive properties of MyoD will be investigated in these                    studies. 2) The Id gene will be isolated from a mouse genomic                   library and the enhancer elements responsible for its regulated                 expression during differentiation will be identified by deletion                analysis, transient transfections and the use of transgenic mice.               3) Inducible versions of the Id gene will be constructed to                     determine the phenotype of timed over expression of Id in                       cultured cells and transgenic mice.",
