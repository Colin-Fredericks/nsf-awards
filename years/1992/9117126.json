 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a collaborative research project between                Maria Papadakis and Barry Bozeman of the Technology and                         Information Policy Program, Syracuse University, and Yukihiro                   Hirano, Director of the 1st Policy-Oriented Research Group,                     National Institute of Science and Technology Policy (NISTEP),                   Science and Technology Agency, Tokyo, Japan.  The project is the                third stage of a multi-year project comparing the government R&D                laboratory systems of the United States and Japan.  The objective is            to provide detailed data and information on the characteristics of              the U.S. and Japanese government R&D laboratories with respect                  to their structure, outputs, research agendas and dynamics, inter-              organizational relationships, and technology transfer among                     laboratories.  It is expected that this research will provide practical,        policy-relevant information on these two government R&D systems                 as well as pre-theoretic models on the role of government-                      performed R&D in national innovation systems.                                                                                                                   The first stage of the project, a study of U.S. R&D labs, has been              completed.  The second stage, which involves administering                      detailed questionnaires to Japanese laboratory personnel, is in                 progress.  The third stage, which will begin with this award,                   involves in-depth semi-structured interviews of laboratory personnel            and rigorous analytical comparison (statistical and qualitative) of             the U.S. and Japanese responses.  The investigators will publish                their results for widespread dissemination.",
