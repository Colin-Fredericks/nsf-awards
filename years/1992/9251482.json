 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Computer Science will establish a Computer                    Graphics and Visualization Laboratory to address the increasing                 interest and demand for instruction in data visualization                       techniques, for both majors and non-majors.  The project will                   allow the creation of the laboratory featuring a cluster of                     powerful UNIX workstations configured with hardware,                            peripherals, and software specifically to support high-                         performance computer graphics.  The laboratory will enable the                  department to enhance and extend two existing major courses,                    Computer Graphics and Advanced Graphics and Visualization, and                  to offer for the first time service courses focusing                            specifically on advanced visualization techniques.  The                         development plan calls for the immediate introduction of a                      course targeted at science majors, Data Visualization and                       Display Techniques, with the possibility of other service                       courses being added later to address the needs of other                         potential user groups.  The laboratory's graphical environment                  will support both these regular courses and special projects,                   and will extend the level of training beyond what is possible                   with the currently available PC-instructional clusters.  With                   the new laboratory, the students can gain hands-on experience                   with state-of-the-art graphics and visualization technologies                   and better prepare themselves for careers in research, public                   service, or industry.",
