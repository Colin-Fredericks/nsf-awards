 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Massachusetts Microelectronics Center (M2C) is conducting                   a two week (ten day) project-oriented workshop on the                           fundamentals of VLSI design and CAD tool usage.  This workshop                  is directed towards Electrical Engineering faculty with little                  experience in VLSI design, Electrical Engineering faculty with                  expertise in VLSI but little familiarity with the design tools                  available in an academic environment, and Computer Science                      faculty with minimal acquaintance with electronic engineering.                  The goal of the Workshop is to equip the faculty with the                       resources necessary to conduct an undergraduate course in VLSI                  design that would culminate in the fabrication and subsequent                   test of student-designed chips.  Topics include an introduction                 to UNIX, device behavior, design methodology including design                   reviews, design styles, and process fundamentals.  Lectures on                  design methodology and process technology are supplemented by                   design and simulation laboratory exercises on CAD workstations.                 Emphasis is on public-domain CAD tools in a UNIX environment.                   The course culminates in the fabrication of student projects at                 M2C's integrated circuit fabrication facility.  Fabricated                      chips will be mailed to participants shortly after the end of                   the Workshop.  In addition, previously fabricated chips                         designed to the same project specifications, some working and                   some with planned design flaws, are to be tested during the                     workshop.",
