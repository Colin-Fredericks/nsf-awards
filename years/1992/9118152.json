 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anabaena is a filamentous cyanobacterium that responds to                       nitrogen deprivation by elaborating along the filaments semi-                   regularly spaced cells called heterocysts that are specialized                  for nitrogen fixation. The cells that differentiate in response                 to nitrogen step down may be the same as those that first sense                 nitrogen deprivation; or if the latter cells respond to nitrogen                deprivation by initiating a sequential process of scavenging                    nitrogen form contiguous cell, the differentiating cells may be                 positioned distant from the cells that first sense nitrogen                     deprivation; or if differentiation merely makes manifest a latent               (albeit experimentally manipulable) pattern, the differentiating                cells may bear no consistent spatial relationship to the cells                  first sensing nitrogen deprivation. Dr. Wolk has developed an                   array of techniques to study spatial and temporal aspects of the                expression of genes in the developing filament, and dependency                  relationships between pairs of genes. This array includes the use               of transposons and site directed insertions that incorporate                    genes for luciferase to report on the activity of individual                    promoters cell by cell along a filament. To elucidate the                       mechanism of heterocyst spacing, he proposes to: 1) identify                    genes required for control of heterocyst formation, genes                       regulating early responses to nitrogen deprivation, and the                     dependency relationships among them; 2) elucidate the spatial                   relationship between the sites of activation of genes in response               to nitrogen deprivation, ant the location of eventual heterocyst                formation; 3) ascertain whether possible transcriptional                        inhomogeneities in nitrogen replete filaments bear any spatial                  relationship to subsequent differentiation; and 4) investigate                  how particular experimental manipulations affect differentiation                and pattern formation.",
