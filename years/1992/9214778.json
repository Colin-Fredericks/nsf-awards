 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study changes in household and                       families in Latin America during the period 1970-1985.  The                     project will first describe the nature of changes in household                  and family configuration in 14 countries and examine whether                    these changes can be accounted for by changes in fertility,                     nuptiality, mortality, and migration, or whether changes in                     preferences for living in certain types of households, such as                  female headed households, also is a source of change.  The second               goal of the project is to compare household changes between                     different socio-economic strata and between countries in order to               test hypotheses about the effects of social and economic changes                as the societal level on changes in household structures.                       Finally, the project will project household structure in these                  Latin American countries for the period 1995-2050 to assess the                 changing importance of demographic components.  Particular                      attention will be paid to the living arrangements of the elderly                and the social demands they entail.  The project will use census                data for the early 1970s and for the 1980s.  These data will be                 analyzed by a combination of methods and techniques including                   multivariate models to quantify the contribution of changes in                  composition and changes in effects, generalized stable population               models to obtain information about intercensal flows, and                       modified macro and micro simulation models to assess the                        magnitude of he contribution of demographic factors and of non-                 demographic characteristics.                                                         This study will provide a much needed study of changes in                  households and families in Latin America.  The study will provide               very valuable descriptive information, but it will also broaden                 the current theoretical debate about the causes of change in                    families and households which has been based largely on research                done in North America and Europe.  The study will also contribute               to the development of simulation models for the projection of                   changes in household structure.",
