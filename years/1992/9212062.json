 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                   Chemistry Program, will support studies on very rapid intra-                    molecular rearrangements of organometallic molecules using the                  technique of microwave dielectric relaxation.  The systems                      chosen for study are primarily those that have previously                       resisted characterization by dynamic, NMR techniques because                    their rates of rearrangement.  Systems to be studied include                    tetrahedral - square planar interconversions in four coordinate                 nickel(II) complexes, Berry pseudorotation processes in                         trigonal bipyramidal compounds of P, Sb, Ru and Os, and eight                   coordinate beta-diketonate complexes of Zr, Ce, Th, and U.                      Measurements will be made as a function of temperature so that                  activation energies can be extracted from the data.                             %%%                                                                             It has been recognized for some time that many molecules                        undergo a variety of types of intramolecular motions.  In the                   case of many organometallic compounds these motions may result                  in the interconversion of stereoisomers and can have important                  consequences for chemical reactivity.  In other cases, such as                  those to be examined here, the rearrangements are degenerate                    and result in no apparent change in the structure of the                        molecule.  Understanding the nature of the energy barriers to                   such rearrangements is fundamental to understanding the process                 itself.  Degenerate rearrangements frequently occur at such                     high rates that there are very few experimental techniques that                 can be utilized.  Microwave dielectric relaxation is one                        technique that can be applied to certain compounds.  Although                   Professor DiCarlo is located at a primarily undergraduate                       institution, his laboratory is one of the few in the world that                 is equipped to make these measurements and to provide some                      badly needed quantitative information concerning the barriers                   to rearrangement in some important classes of compounds.",
