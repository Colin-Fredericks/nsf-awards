 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year project designed to build a science                        culture within participating schools from Hartford CT, and                      to promote environmental literacy.  The project will build                      upon previously funded NSF activities and will provide                          continued and expanded support to 15 of the teachers who                        participated in that previous program.  The current project                     will extend the program to an additional 78 teachers over                       the next three years (total: 93 teachers).  During the                          academic year, project staff will work with teachers and                        their students in the schools; during the summer, teachers                      will participate in a three week workshop.  Team leaders                        will be selected from among the participants to become                          resource persons and peer coaches in their home schools;                        they will receive leadership training and extensive support                     from project staff. Computers and related technology,                           including telecommunications, will be used to create a                          Center for Environmental Science in each school.                                                                                                                This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                         Program because it enhances participants' knowledge of                          science and effective teaching methods, identifies and                          trains selected participants to become lead teachers within                     their schools, establishes strong networking ties among                         participants and project staff, and targets teachers of                         predominantly (80% or greater) minority populations of                          children.                                                                                                                                                       Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 9% of the amount                          requested from NSF.",
