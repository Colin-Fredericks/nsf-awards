 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer vision systems typically begin by finding boundaries in                their input images, i.e. locations at which properties change                   sharply (often indicating the edges of objects).  Boundary                      finding algorithms require an estimate of how much values vary                  within each image region.  Currently-available algorithms assume                that this scale of variation is constant across the image and,                  typically, that it is known a priori.  This assumption holds only               for the simplest images and fails for many common sorts of                      inputs, including images containing significant texture,                        functions describing image texture (e.g. texture orientation at                 each image location), and surface depths computed by stereo                     matching.  This research will develop an algorithm for estimating               scale within individual image regions and, using it, a boundary                 finder that can operate on a much wider range of inputs.  The new               scale estimator relies on two keys ideas.  To eliminate                         contamination from a few \"bad\" values, the standard deviation                   (the traditional scale estimator), is replaced by an estimator                  from robust statistics (e.g. the -trimmed standard deviation).                  To avoid peaks in scale estimates near boundaries, the algorithm                derives its scale estimate from the minimum-scale neighborhood of               each image location.//",
