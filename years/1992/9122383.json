 "awd_abstract_narration": "The projected decline of available scientific personnel in the             United States has become an issue of growing concern.  The Task                 Committee on Undergraduate Science and Engineering Education of the             National Science Board has expressed the view that unless the                   achievement and participation of women and minorities in                        mathematics and science is increased, the nation will be unable to              meet its technical and scientific needs.  This proposal seeks to                identify institutional characteristics and educational programs                 that promote the interest and participation of women in mathematics             and science.  Specifically, this study examines the effect of such              factors on students' experiences and attitudes towards mathematics              and science at the middle grades level, a critical developmental                period associated with the emergence of gender differences in these             fields.  Data analysis will be based on a nationally representative             survey of eighth grade students, their teachers, and school                     administrators (National Educational Longitudinal Study, 1988), and             a recently developed methodology of hierarchical linear modeling                will be used to conceptualize new questions about the relationship              between educational environments and gender differences in                      mathematics and science.  This methodology will permit                          identification of between-school variations in such gender                      differences and the explanation of these variations as a function               of institutional characteristics of schools.                                                                                                                         This project, which is jointly supported by the Sociology                  Program and the Education and Human Resources Office of Studies,                Evaluation and Dissemination, will contribute to the understanding              of the role of institutional factors on educational outcomes.  It               will also provide information to policy makers who seek to                      establish educational environments supportive of female achievement             in mathematics and science.",
