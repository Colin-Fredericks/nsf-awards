 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research planned in this project centers on classes of                 special functions known as orthogonal polynomials.  Orthogonality               can only be considered in the presence of a measure; in this work               the measures will be concentrated on the real line or on a                      circle.  The work focuses on the connection between a measure and               the recurrence coefficients of the corresponding orthogonal                     polynomials.  Work will also be done investigating the                          summability and convergence of orthogonal polynomial expansions.                The methods involve minimizing polynomial integrals (the                        Christoffel function), asymptotic behavior of difference                        equations and eigenvalues of infinite tridiagonal matrices.                     These same techniques can be used for studying solutions of the                 Schrodinger equation in a central field of force and the                        Christoffel function is related to statistical prediction theory.                    Orthogonal polynomials form a subclass of special functions                developed over centuries for the solution or approximate solution               of fundamental equations modeling the physical world.  They are                 generally simple to express, relatively easy to compute and often               occur as fundamental solutions of certain differential equations.",
