 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effect of fluorine substitution on radical, diradical,                      carbanion, carbene, and pericyclic reactions will be conducted.                 By strategic placement of fluorine on a substrate, the kinetic,                 stereochemical, and regiochemical effects will be evaluated.                    Processes to be investigated include Cope rearrangements,                       electrocyclic reactions, cyclopropane and vinylcyclopropane                     rearrangements, and methylcyclopropane and methylcyclobutane                    rearrangements. A highlight of the investigation will be the                    use of intramolecular cyclization reactions to examine steric,                  polar, and stereoelectronic reactivity effects of fluorine                      substituents on reactions of radicals, carbanions, carbenes,                    and 1,3-dipoles.                                                                %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       studies of Professor W. R. Dolbier at the University of Florida                 on fluorocarbon chemistry. The incorporation of fluorine into a                 variety of substances can enhance their utility and provide                     materials with superior properties for use in a variety of                      different applications ranging from chemically resistant fibers                 to polymers which resist penetration of water in high humidity                  environments. In order to maximize the impact of fluorine on                    the substrate to which it is attached, it is necessary to fully                 understand the effect that fluorine has on chemical reactions                   under a variety of different conditions. The studies of                         Professor Dolbier will provide invaluable information which                     will help accelerate the development of fluorine based                          materials and insure that full advantage is taken of the unique                 properties of fluorocarbons.",
