 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has become increasingly apparent in recent years that                   understanding the organic/inorganic interface and the                           geobiochemical role of bacteria and clay minerals in sedimentary                basins is crucial to development of accurate, comprehensive models              of equilibrium and mass transfer in diagenetic processes.  A myriad             of reversible and irreversible reactions occur in these processes,              all of which are in principle amenable to thermodynamic analysis.               For example, thermodynamic calculations can be used together with               compositional data to identify stable and metastable equilibrium                states in diagenetic systems and assess kinetic constraints on                  reaction progress.  Calculations of this kind can be carried out                with the aid of equations of state developed in this laboratory                 over the past several decades.  These equations make it possible                to investigate the chemical and thermodynamic consequences of                   reactions among a wide variety of minerals, gases and aqueous                   species at elevated temperatures and pressures.  The purpose of                 this proposal is to request long-range support for continuation of              this research in the context of diagenetic processes with emphasis              on organic/inorganic reactions and those of geobiochemical                      interest.  The goals of the project over the next five years                    include comprehensive calculation of the thermodynamic properties               of organic liquids, solids, gases and aqueous species as a function             of temperature and pressure, investigation of the extent to which               metastable equilibrium prevails among organic molecules in                      petroleum, aqueous species in oil field brines, and authigenic                  mineral assemblages in hydrocarbon reservoirs and source rocks,                 quantification of thermodynamic constraints on the role of bacteria             in diagenetic processes at elevated temperatures and pressures,                 and calculation of mass transfer involving organic/inorganic                    reactions and clay minerals in sedimentary basins.",
