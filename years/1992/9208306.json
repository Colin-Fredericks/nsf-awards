 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of feedback laws for systems                                         characterized by complicated nonlinear dynamical                                behavior is a challenging research task which has                               attracted an increasing interest in recent years.                               Advances in nonlinear control theory will                                       substantially improve the design of control systems                             for light-weighted robot arms, for autopilots and                               guidance systems of highly maneuverable aircrafts,                              increase the flexibility and energy efficiency in the                           regulation of chemical plants, facilitate the real-time                         reconfiguration of a control system after the                                   occurrence of a failure.  Among the many problems                               which must be confronted, a most important one is                               the desing of feedback laws achieving tracking of                               prescribed exogenous commands and rejection of                                  exogenous disturbances.  The approaches to the                                  problem of tracking/rejection of exogenous inputs                               in a control system depend upon the model chosen                                to describe the family of exogenous inputs which                                are expected to affect the system.  If no model is                              available, an appealing strategy -which revealed                                itself very powerful and attractive in the case of                              linear systems- is to base the design  on the worst                             possible situation.  For instance, in the frequency                             domain, the feedback laws are designed so as to                                 minimize the maximal amplitude of the frequency                                 response to the exogenous inputs.  This research                                project would contribute to the extension of these                              design methodologies to systems described by                                    nonlinear mathematical models.  Using methods                                   and results from the geometric theory of control                                systems, the theory of differential games and the                               qualitative theory of dynamical system, the purpose                             of the research is to establish sufficiently general                            results about existence  and actual design of                                   feedback control laws achieving attenuation of                                  unmodeled external disturbances.",
