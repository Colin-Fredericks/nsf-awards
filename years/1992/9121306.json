 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                      Chemistry Division is supporting a research project by Kenneth                  Jordan in which he is investigating the properties of small                     ionized clusters.  The work places special emphasis on problems                 of charge localization in clusters, the characterization of                     temporary anions of clusters, the interaction between weakly                    coupled chromophores, and the computer simulation of cluster                    properties.  Effort is divided between the development and                      refinement of new techniques and use of the methods in                          applications to chemically important systems.  The sphere                       approach used for stabilization calculations on temporary                       anions is being pursued and effort made to improve the                          efficiency of the jump-walk/multiple histogram method for Monte                 Carlo simulations.  The latter is to be used to study                           \"solid-liquid\" melting transitions in small water clusters.                     %%%                                                                             Theoretical chemists have made great progress in understanding                  and predicting the properties of matter in the gas phase, but                   have much more difficulty with solids.  One approach to the                     problem is to examine small clusters of molecules in which the                  intermolecular forces responsible for holding a solid together                  are manifested in a system with a relatively small number of                    particles.  This project is developing computational methods                    for investigating such clusters, with special emphasis on                       electrically charged clusters.",
