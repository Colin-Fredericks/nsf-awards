The meeting will cover methods and                                      experimental techniques in molecular biophysics,                                spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography and theoretical                             and computational methods in selected biophysical                               problems.  The U.S. organizer for this meeting is                               Dr. Horacio Farach of the University of South                                   Carolina. Participation will be extended to 6 U.S.                              lecturers and 8 researchers from Argentina, Brazil,                             Colombia, Chile, and Venezuela.                                                                                                                                 The International Center for Theoretical Physics in                             Trieste was established to advance research in                                  developing countries. It supports research                                      activities in high energy and solid state physics,                              it provides a range of advanced courses and                                     conferences, and offers a full program of visits in                             all branches of physics and applied mathematics.  By                            getting together scientists from developing                                     countries to exchange information on current                                    research in biophysics, this award will serve to                                advance the goals of the Science in Developing                                  Countries program.",
