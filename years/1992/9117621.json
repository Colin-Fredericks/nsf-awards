 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on fear of failure has indicated that women avoid                      experiences rather than risk the possibility of failure or                      uncertainty.  The present study will examine constructive risk-                 taking among a group of women who are in nontraditional occupations             and who have chosen to work in the Antarctic.  Models of fear of                failure also indicate that what is fearful about failure for                    women is the possibility of negative social consequences.  A                    second purpose of the present study is to examine how women low                 on fear of failure cope with the social consequences of                         constructive risk-taking, and also to examine the existing social               supports for women in the Antarctic.  The isolation and                         environmental features of the Antarctic have applications for                   other confined microsocieties that some women will be                           experiencing in the near future.  A third purpose of the study is               to investigate five factors concerning the Antarctic experience                 for women that have previously only been studied with men.                      Structured interviews will be conducted with women who have                     recently returned from the Antarctic.  The results will be used                 to generate quantitative measures and to formulate theories of                  risk-taking and social coping among women in nontraditional                     roles.",
