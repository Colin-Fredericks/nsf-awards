 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the development of a Computer                            Productivity Initiative (CPI) that is designed to improve                       computer science education by developing a formal laboratory                    experience spanning the four year undergraduate program.  CPI                   will allow the students to address a specific industrial                        problem from the specifications phase through to the                            implementation phase.  Old Dominion University will be                          producing curriculum support modules, and other educational                     material which will be made available to educational                            institutions.                                                                                                                                                   Old Dominion University will be using a Computer Productivity                   Initiative to modify its Computer Science curriculum to                         provide its students with the knowledge to increase their                       productivity in software development.  Over the four year time                  period of undergraduate study, computer science students will                   address a specific unstructured problem in the context of a                     business application.  Existing courses and laboratories at                     Old Dominion University will be modified and new ones                           developed.  The results of the curriculum and materials                         development will be made available to other educational                         institutions, and results of the educational experience will                    be disseminated in technical and educational journals, and at                   presentations at professional meetings.",
