 "awd_abstract_narration": "Informal observations suggest that, despite a growing body of                   environmental agency experience with ranking and rating systems,                their effectiveness in informing the decision processes they are                intended to support has been very mixed.  More specifically, the                important actors in policy debates in which these systems are                   used appear about as likely to see them as irrelevant or as                     impediments to decisionmaking as they are to see them as truly                  instrumental to the outcomes achieved.  This observation appears                to be especially relevant to situations with the potential to                   affect significantly the distribution of resources outside of the               managing agencies themselves, the primary focus of the proposed                 research.  The research objectives are to explore the                           relationships between the real or perceived utility of                          ranking/rating systems in informing policy debates and an array                 of factors associated with a) technical aspects of how such                     systems are constructed, b) problem setting, and c) the                         institutional environment in which such systems are utilized or                 applied.  The research will explore how values incorporated in                  mathematical formulations of ranking/rating systems inluence                    policy oriented learning, as well as how factors such as                        discretion, social conflict, and credibility of experts do.                     Thus, the study can focus on hypotheses and variables that can                  help in understanding and explaining when learning occurs within                and between groups concerned about environmental policy.  The                   investigator will study two cases in depth -- the use of decision               systems in coastal wetlands protection and mitigation, and use of               such systems in the cleanup of hazardous waste sites in the                     coastal zone.  The research design uses review of documentation,                and phone and in-person interviews.   It will use expert                        elicitation techniques in studying the first case and, possibly,                content analysis in the second study.  Results from this work                   have both theoretical and practical interest.  The investigator                 is well qualified; the research plan is good; the proposal is                   recommended for support with high priority.",
