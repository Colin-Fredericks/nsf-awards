 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research indicates that the photoreceptors of the retina                 are highly dependent upon the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).                 The interface between the RPE and light receptors is a complex                  network of macromolecules, the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM).                 The IPM surrounds the outer segments of the light receptors and                 any nutrient or waste product must pass through it.  The IMP also               contains macromolecules necessary for retinal adhesion to the RPE               which prevent retinal detachment.  The primary objective of this                research is to analyze the organization and components of the IPM               in an unusual retina, the cone-dominant retina of the ground                    squirrel.                                                                                                                                                       Undergraduate students will be trained in light- and electron-                  microscopic techniques as well as biochemical studies.  Because                 of its high cone density, the ground squirrel retina can serve as               a model of the foveal area of primate and human retinas.  The IPM               domains associated with blue- and green-sensitive cones will be                 analyzed for their anatomical and biochemical differences in an                 effort to determine which features they share with other mammals                and which may be unique to the ground squirrel retina, itself.                  Insights gained from these studies will supplement studies of the               primate retina and fovea and should prove relevant to the human                 retina.",
