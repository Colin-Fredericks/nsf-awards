 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formalizing diagnostic reasoning is a necessary aspect of creating              useful diagnostic tools.  Even though much progress has been made,              there are several deficiencies in the existing formalization.                   These include the definition of diagnostic reasoning as a single-               stage process which is independent of the use of the diagnosis, of              tests which can be done to clarify the hypothesized diagnoses, or               of the utility associated with the treatment of the abnormalities.              This research proposes a sequential decision framework for                      diagnostic reasoning which overcomes many of these deficiencies.                A key new intuition for this approach is modeling diagnostic                    reasoning as a process which consists not solely as a single step               of computing a diagnosis (as there is considerable controversy over             what a diagnosis actually is, even given the same input data);                  instead, it is a multi-stage decision process in which decisions                about testing and treatment, as well as scarce resource and utility             considerations, are crucial parts of the model.  This framework                 extends most existing formalization of diagnostic reasoning to                  incorporate important aspects of the diagnostic process.  Two                   applications of the framework to diagnostic systems are                         investigated in this research.  The first application (which has                been implemented) is a Markov decision network model for the                    diagnosis of acute abdominal pain.  The second application is a                 sequential process of consistency-based diagnosis interleaved with              tests, for diagnosing Boolean circuits.                                          //",
