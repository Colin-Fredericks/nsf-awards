 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to study the heating of the solar corona by                observing the coronal oscillation spectrum at the total solar                   eclipse of 3 November 1994, a favorable solar eclipse in terms of               duration, sky clarity, and weather forecasts. The observations                  provide tests of a mechanism to explain the heating of the solar                corona via Alfven waves. The heating takes place in the region of               formation of the solar wind. Prior observations we made at the                  total solar eclipses of 1980 and 1983 indicate excess power in the              Fourier transforms between 0.5 and 2 Hz. The expedition was clouded             out of the observing the 1 July 1991 total solar eclipse. The                   proposed new experiment improves on the prior observations in a                 variety of ways, including improved digitization and data                       recording, improved image acquisition during the brief period of                totality, and a major expansion of the frequency range under                    observation through greatly improved tracking.                                       Studies of the solar corona at eclipses have been a major part             of the success of the Astronomy Department at Williams College in               attracting and training students. Undergraduate students have been              intimately connected with our prior eclipse expeditions and the                 associated data reduction and analysis, and this proposal will                  enable the PI to continue the active involvement of students.",
