 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most urgent questions in biological oceanography                at present is that of the fate of small phototrophs in pelagic                  food webs.  The prevailing concept, based on both theoretical                   considerations as well as laboratory and field data, is that                    phagotrophic protists are the dominant predators of < 5 um sized                cells, and as well may consume a significant portion of the                     biomass production of larger phytoplankton.  Most previous                      studies of protistan herbivory have involved either laboratory                  experiments with single species, primarily ciliates, or                         estimation of total microzooplankton grazing pressure on natural                phytoplankton assemblages. A more complete picture of the                       magnitude and details of the component parts of this link in                    pelagic food webs in needed, especially with respect to the role                of phagotrophic flagellates.  Dr. Shapiro and collaborators will                investigate herbivory by pelagic flagellates and ciliates in the                natural planktonic assemblages of Oregon coastal waters.                        Questions addressed will include: 1) Do phagotrophic protists                   have a greater grazing impact on <5 um sized phytoplankton than                 on cells > 5 um? 2) What is the relative grazing impact of                      flagellates versus ciliates on phytoplankton? 3) Do rates of                    protistan herbivory show consistent day/night differences? 4) Do                thresholds of prey density exist? 5) Does predation affect the                  cell division rates of phytoplankton? 6) Do phagotrophic protists               show selective feeding among various phytoplankton taxa in situ?",
