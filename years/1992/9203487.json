 "awd_abstract_narration": "Design is the key technology for industries that wish to                   increase their competitive advantage in the international                       marketplace.  This advantage comes from the ability to identify                 customer demands and quickly translate these into new products.                 The application of methodologies which can shorten the lead-time                in product development and be applied as a general tool for design              in many fields will be essential for the future competitiveness of              the United States industry.  The purpose of the workshop is to                  explore how the axiomatic approach to design can be applied to                  satisfy the industrial needs and be further developed to provide                the fundamental basis for design.                                                     The workshop will examine the design needs and problem in the             areas of product and process design, software design and                        organizational design.  The needs of the industry will be examined              in terms of fundamental design methodologies.  The constraints and              requirements imposed by industrial practice to the automotive,                  construction, material, electronic and software industries will be              discussed.***//",
