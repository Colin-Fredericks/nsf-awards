 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this workshop is to assist in the development of               an integrated perspective on the scope, achievements, and promise               of Cognitive Science.  An applications perspective on Cognitive                 Science furthers this goal in three respects:  First, the ability               to address applications problems provides one standard for                      recognizing progress and for identifying absent areas of scientific             understanding.  Second, applications problems generally require the             integration of multiple scientific disciplines, but drive                       integration with a common goal and context for interdisciplinary                discussion.  Third, complex applications problems may assist in                 clarifying the boundaries of Cognitive Science, by introducing                  research needs that are clearly outside the basic research agenda               for the community.                                                                                                                                              This workshop will assemble twenty-four prominent researchers from              the basic Cognitive Science research community; they have been                  chosen for their eagerness to generate the mapping between their                basic research activities and applications, while strengthening                 their own understanding of applied problems.  The workshop will be              conducted over a two-day period and will center on the theme of                 Human Performance in the Complex Workplace.  It will include                    representatives from the basic research community, NSF, the applied             research community, and application-domain specialists from                     government and industry.  The morning sessions will consist of                  brief presentations by domain specialists.  The afternoon sessions              will consist of small working groups, each analyzing a complex                  applications problem according to the lines of relevant Cognitive               Science research.  The conclusions from each working group will be              assembled and preserved in the form of a publishable report.                                                                                                    The expected outcomes include increased awareness by both the                   scientifically- and practically-oriented participants of the                    potential relevance of the Cognitive Sciences to applications                   concerns.  The workshop is also likely to promote interest in                   uninvestigated aspects of Cognitive Science that serve as barriers              both to greater scientific understanding as well as to societally               useful applications.",
