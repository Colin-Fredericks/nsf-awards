 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                      Chemistry Division is supporting work by Professor Taylor on                    the chaotic behavior of the energy levels of molecules in                       highly excited vibrational states and in intermediate resonant                  transition state complexes.  Such energy levels are governed by                 local dynamic adiabatic potentials whose existence is not                       evident in the static molecular potentials and hypersurfaces.                   These potentials and motions are related to phase space                         structures as periodic orbits and reduced dimension tori.                       Professor Taylor is using a classical method of analysis which                  yields approximations to the desired dynamic potentials and to                  the motions.  The research is intended to demonstrate that the                  method is capable of providing a physical interpretation of                     experimental and computational studies on intramolecular                        vibrational relaxation and on the spectra of larger molecules.                  %%%                                                                             When molecules are highly excited by absorption of electro-                     magnetic energy or by chemical reaction, they populate very                     complex vibrational energy states that are not predictable by                   the patterns found for their lower energy vibrational states.                   Experimental and computational methods can provide data, but                    Professor Taylor is seeking a relatively simple, classical                      method of analysis of the results that will yield qualitative                   insight into the dynamics of the systems.",
