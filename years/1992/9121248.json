This collaborative effort relates              to the metal exchange of polynuclear materials.  Project funding                will enable Drs. Mohamed A. El-Sayad and Ahmed El-Toukhy from                   Alexandria University, Egypt, to spend approximately three months               in the laboratory of Dr. Geoffrey Davies at Northeastern                        University.  Dr. Davies will visit and work at Alexandria                       University for a three month period as well.  The proposed new work             will build on the past efforts of the investigators including the               creation of larger and more diverse multi-metal molecules at lower              cost, and the use of these molecules as sources of new metal alloys             and chemical catalysts to be used in still newer systems.                       Development of the transmetalation phenomenon will lead to the                  establishment of new areas of study in organic and organometallic               chemistry.                                                                                                                                                      This project in polymetallic chemistry fulfills the program                     objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                 experts in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary                 talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                   interest and competence.",
