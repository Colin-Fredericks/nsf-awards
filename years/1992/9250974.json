 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will integrate the teaching of telephony, data,                    and optical communication for undergraduates.  The graphical                    object-oriented software CANeT will be used to facilitate an                    intuitive and experimental understanding of difficult                           networking concepts and analysis.  The experiments will be                      performed on nine SUN IPX workstations served by a SUN SPARC II                 GX workstation.  The workstations will be networked by an                       ethernet network and an optical FDDI network.  The ethernet                     network will provide basic low-speed communication among the                    workstations, while the FDDI network will serve to demonstrate                  traffic measurements and high-speed networks for transporting                   graphics, data, and video.  The network, besides being the Tool                 for experimentation, also is the Object of experimentation.                     Students will acquire hands-on experience on a real network by                  implementing and testing elementary network protocols using                     UNIX sockets.  Special projects following the course will train                 students to handle real network problems.The course emphasizes                  the skill of analyzing a complex system into its components,                    solving the component problems, and then synthesizing the                       component solutions to meet system objectives.  Engineering                     iterates is a key feature of the CANeT tool for meeting system                  objectives.  System modeling is also emphasized, whereas                        sophisticated mathematical analysis is facilitated by CANeT.                    Programming exercises allow students to learn communication                     protocol by experimentation, rather than by deciphering                         acronyms of standards.This project will establish a modern                      network laboratory, with numerous exercises and projects, and                   plans for disseminating the laboratory software are                             incorporated.  An undergraduate textbook based on a new                         framework rather than the usual OSI 7 layer framework will be                   completed.",
