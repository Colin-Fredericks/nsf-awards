 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation is sponsoring its first National                Conference on Diversity in the Scientific Workforce, which is scheduled         in Washington, DC on September 24-27, 1992.  The conference will focus          attention on the Foundation's role in the education of minorities who           are underrepresented in science, engineering and mathematics (SEM)              fields.  Conference activities will include research presentations by           230 HRD project students.                                                                                                                                       Morgan State University proposes to coordinate student component                activities including arranging student travel and hotel accommodations          and scheduling networking activities among students and between                 students and scientists.  The student component will complement the             planning and development of the NSF action plan by illustrating the             success of current NSF efforts in minority SEM education, thereby               forming a basis on which to build future strategies.  Morgan would be           assisted in these tasks by Career Communications Group, Inc., a                 minority-owned firm that has extensive experience in planning student           career development activities.",
