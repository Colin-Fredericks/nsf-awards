 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on approximation methods for a broad               class of nonlinear optimization problems.  Central to this study                will be the construction of regularization schemes based on                     proximal type methods which play an important role in the                       development of numerical schemes based on duality and                           decomposition techniques for large scale problems.  A new class                 of proximal-like mappings associated with closed convex functions               is introduced, where the usual quadratic term is replaced by                    entropy-like distances.  When applied to the dual of an                         optimization problem, this gives rise to a wide variety of new                  augmented Lagrangian methods which have many attractive                         properties, not present in the classical quadratic augmented                    Lagrangian.  The main thrust of the proposed research is to                     follow this approach with an attempt to develop new mathematical                tools for the computational and theoretical analysis of                         optimization problems.  Properties of the optimal sets of the                   regularized problems, the construction of iterative schemes for                 approximating primal and dual solutions and convergence analysis                issues will be studied.  Duality methods and decomposition                      techniques will be used to support the development of efficient                 computational schemes for convex as well as nonconvex and                       nondifferentiable problems, by taking advantage of the problem                  structure that is present in most nonlinear applied problems.                   Such development will be significant for applying our results to                a variety of concrete problems arising from applied sciences and                engineering.                                                                         Proximal methods play an important role in the development                 of computational methods based on duality theory and of                         decomposition techniques leading to parallel algorithms.                        Decomposition of large scale problems is an important and                       classical topic in applied mathematics and optimization.  Recent                advances in computer technology have motivated the search for                   constructing new algorithms for large scale problems, by taking                 full advantage of certain structures that many nonlinear applied                problems may possess.  Such problems arise, for example, as a                   result of a discretization of infinite dimensional optimization                 and optimal control problems.  They arise in a wide range of                    applications such as optimal shape design, structural                           optimization, and image reconstruction problems.",
