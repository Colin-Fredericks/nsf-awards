The technique has two primary goals:                                                                                                                            1.       to expose students' common misconceptions about                                 fundamental principles via the use of ConcepTests, and                                                                                                 2.       to rectify these notions, and promote understanding of                          basic concepts, through Peer Instruction. Greater                               understanding, in turn, leads to a greater appreciation of                      the material, and is ultimately expected to result in an                        increased interest in the sciences.                                                                                                                    An initial application of this method in introductory physics                   classes indicated that the program achieved both of these                       objectives.  The initial research is being extended to quantify                 the results, improve and fine tune the procedures, and                          systematize its application so it can be widely applied in                      undergraduate science, mathematics, and engineering education.                  A parallel application of the method is being conducted at                      Lowell University to examine the transferability of the                         methods.",
