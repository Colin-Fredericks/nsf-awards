 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this two year program is 1) to continue a previous               teacher enhancement program for high school biology teachers in                 the areas of molecular biology and biotechnology, and 2) to begin               development of a cadre of teams of lead teachers (two per team)                 capable of providing in-service training to other teachers in                   their local areas.                                                                                                                                              The program will provide 168 teachers with 1) A laboratory-based,               two-week workshop which will be held at one of four campuses of                 the California State University System, 2) a symposium on related               ethical and social issues, 3) a follow-up meeting focused on the                evaluation of supplementary curricular materials for the regular,               honors, and advanced placement courses in biology, and 4)                       outreach support, via a mobile van and via scientist-educator                   partnerships.  The two-week laboratory-based workshop will                      provide theory and methods in molecular biology, including                      transformation of bacteria and gene splicing.  The workshop will                also address strategies for the implementation of this material                 into the high school classroom.  During a three day symposium,                  the ethical and social issues related to these techniques will be               addressed.                                                                                                                                                      In the second year of the program, 12 teams of twenty-four former               participants will be selected (team members chosen from the same                local areas) and trained at San Francisco State University to                   lead local on-site workshops.  The lead teacher training workshop               will provide additional in-depth training in molecular biology,                 coupled with guidance in effective presentation to fellow                       teachers.  Furthermore, it will provide guidance in 1)                          establishing local support for education projects in their                      communities, 2) the generation of industry support, and 3)                      obtaining grant funds.                                                                                                                                          Cost sharing represents 90.0% of the NSF award.",
