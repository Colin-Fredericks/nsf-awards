 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will extend dynamic theories of games in several                  directions.  Part 1 contributes to the growing literature on                    evolution and learning.  It will examine how a stable pattern of                behavior might emerge when players adjust their behavior by trial               and error.  In particular, the study will focus on the long run                 implications of experimentation or mutations in such a process.                 This approach has the potential to make a unique prediction, even               when the underlying game possesses multiple locally stable                      equilibria.                                                                                                                                                     Part 2 examines the nature of implicit collusion in a realistic                 situation, where information about the past history is not common               knowledge.  The investigator will formulate a model of a discounted             repeated game with privately observable outcomes, and will explore              the role of communication.  This study is important because it will             improve our understanding in situations, prevalent in industrial                organization literature and organizational settings, in which                   players receive private signals about past play and implicit                    agreements are developed.",
