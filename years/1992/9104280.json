 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological nitrogen fixation catalyzed by the procaryotic enzyme                nitrogenase is essential for a positive input of N on Earth.  The               N2-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii contains two terminal                oxidases responsible for aerobic O2-consuming respiration.  One of              the oxidases (cytochrome o) is coupled to ATP production, but the               other oxidase (cytochrome b/d) complex) appears not to be coupled               to energy generation.  The latter vigorously O2-consuming oxidase               is thought to be important in removing O2 so that the O2-labile                 nitrogenase enzyme can function.  The specific roles of each of                 these oxidases in respiratory protection of nitrogenase and                     respiratory metabolism of the bacterium are not well-understood.                It is proposed to compare structural gene mutants in the terminal               oxidase cytochrome b/d and cytochrome o with the wild type in many              parameters associated with N2 fixation respiration.  Also the cyt               b/d complex will be purified and reconstituted into lipid vesicles              to directly measure its ability to generate an electrochemical                  proton gradient (energy-generating ability).  Assuming lack of                  electrochemical gradient formation by the purified cyt b/d complex              in membranes, we will then characterize the pertinent structural                features that span the periplasmic and cytoplasmic portions of the              membrane,  and responsible for differences in the uncoupled (non                energy generating) terminal oxidase of A. vinelandii in comparison              with the well-characterized energy-coupled cyt b/d oxidase of E.                coli.  The transcriptional regulation of these two terminal oxidase             complexes, especially their regulation in response to N and O2                  levels will be addressed.  The results are expected to enhance our              knowledge of the diversity and flexibility of bacterial respiratory             metabolism and specifically on respiratory metabolism in                        conjunction with N2 fixation.",
