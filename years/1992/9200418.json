Fifteen students will take part in the program.                Applicants for the program are asked to submit transcripts, letters             of recommendation and an essay.  Participants are selected by a                 panel of faculty members.  The program starts with an orientation               program in which research projects and facilities are described.                Participants are asked to select a project on which to work from                a group of twenty-nine ongoing research projects in mechanical                  engineering.  A faculty supervisor monitors the progress of each                student and they are given increasing responsibilities as their                 skills develop.",
