 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes the creation of a Texas Alliance where the              Texas A&M University will lead an alliance of nine Texas                        Universities (Texas A&I, Corpus Christi State, Laredo State,                    Prairie View A&M, Texas A&M at Galveston, Texas Women's University,             Texas A&M University, Tarleton State, and West Texas University),               31 Texas community colleges, 67 initial industry partners, and 12               national laboratories joined in a comprehensive coalition dedicated             to improving the quality of the undergraduate and graduate                      education of minorities in engineering, mathematics and the                     sciences through a program of enhanced preparation, recruitment,                transfer and retention.  Eleven fundamental goals were presented                which support six major components:                                                                                                                             1.   Texas Summer Research Internships Program - This program is                     the backbone of the Texas Alliance.  It is designed to provide                  a comprehensive financial support mechanism to participating                    students while they interact with scientists and engineering.                                                                                              2.   Pre-College Program - This program will support TexPREP which                   is designed to strengthen problem solving skills and promote                    awareness, interest, and dedication to achieving the goal of                    entering college level engineering and science degree                           programs.                                                                                                                                                  3.   Transfer Stipends - This program will award Transfer Stipends                   to students in their final year of a science or pre-                            engineering degree track at the participating community                         colleges.                                                                                                                                                  4.   Texas Alliance Stipends - This program supplements the Texas                    Summer Research Internship Program by guaranteeing students                     that complete a summer intern academic year stipends support.                                                                                              5.   Non-Traditional Student Stipends Program - This program awards                  stipends to minority women with young children to assist these                  women to continue or start their science or engineering                         education.  This is a supplemental award.                                                                                                                  6.   Internships at Monterrey Tech - Five summer research                            internships for study at Monterrey Institute of Technology in                   Mexico for minority students.  Students will be allowed to                      work in a major center of research were Anglo culture is not                    the dominant experience.",
