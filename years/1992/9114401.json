 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Thomas P. Branson and Palle                       Jorgensen of the University of Iowa and Peter Gilkey of                         the University of Oregon to collaborate in applied                              mathematics with three strong research groups in Germany                        and Denmark.  Their partners are Gestur Olafsson,                               University of Gottingen, Reinhard Werner, University of                         Osnabruck, Bent Oersted, Odense University and Henrik                           Schlichtkrull, Danish Royal Veterinary and Agricultural                         University.  Their collaboration is framed around six                           topics within the general area of \"spectral theory.\"                            These problems are motivated in part by questions in                            mathematical physics and also in conformal geometry, and                        will be approached with methods from modern analysis and                        partial differential operators.  This field is one of                           great activity in Europe, with many strong groups and a                         long tradition of research that offers diverse                                  opportunities for U.S. participation.  In this                                  cooperative project, the U.S. participants offer                                technical power in the \"hard analytic\" and geometric                            aspects, while the European groups bring great strengths                        in invariance group methods.                                                                                                                                    Spectral theory is the mathematical underpinning of all                         scientific work involving a spectrum, ranging from the                          theories of light and electromagnetism to chemistry.  In                        mathematics, spectral theory is a major tool in work in                         several areas in geometry and analysis.",
