 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bryn Mawr-Spelman Summer Mathematics Program is an                     eight-week summer research program for freshman and sophomore                   women from Bryn Mawr, Spelman, and area colleges, with the goal                 of identifying and encouraging talented women to pursue careers                 in the mathematical sciences.  The program would build on and be                modeled after a \"pre-REU\" program that has taken place at Bryn                  Mawr for the past three summers and would complement the Scholars               in Mathematics Program at Spelman.  Eight students would conduct                research whose primary focus is experimentation and exploration                 using the computer; they would be aided by alumnae mentors who                  are just beginning graduate programs in the mathematical                        sciences.  Other features of the program include weekly                         roundtable discussions on issues in mathematics research and                    teaching, employment as teaching assistants in the students'                    respective departments during the academic year, travel to a                    national AMS-MAA meeting, encouragement to participate in an REU                or summer internship program the following summer, and mentoring                and advice regarding the decision to attend graduate school as                  well as the choice of an appropriate graduate program.                               The Summer Program will be held for the next two years on                  the campus of Bryn Mawr College.  The program builds on and                     complements existing undergraduate programs at both Bryn Mawr and               Spelman Colleges and enhances an exchange program between the                   colleges that began in 1984.  It is anticipated that this program               would serve as a model for other early intervention and exchange                programs at the undergraduate level.",
