 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research to be performed by Dr. Murphey is to                   understand how synapses are stabilized during synaptic                          rearrangement in the nervous system.  The synaptic assembly process             is a dynamic one involving both the pre- and post synaptic cells.               During the previous funding period, Dr. Murphey gathered remarkable             results suggesting that the strength and short term plasticity of               synapses can be controlled by the postsynaptic cell.  Dr. Murphey               will now concentrate his studies on the role of the postsynaptic                cell in the process of synapse assembly.  He will utilize                       electrophysiological techniques to describe short and long term                 plasticity at synapses that are constantly being altered.  In                   addition, pharmacological tools will be used to block neurogenisis              or neural activity in an effort to explore the mechanisms                       underlying synapse stabilization and destabilization.  Finally, Dr.             Murphey will use computational tools to explore the consequences                of synaptic rearrangement for circuit function.  Results obtained               from this study will add significantly to our knowledge of what                 interactions are involved in the assembly of synapses.***",
