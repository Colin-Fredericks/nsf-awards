 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. William Axinn under the                 National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.                The objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young                 faculty in science and engineering, to enhance the academic career              of recent Ph.D. recipients, and to foster contact and cooperation               between academia and industry.  Dr. Axinn has already made                      significant research contributions to the field of demography, and              he has the potential to become a leader in academic research and                education.                                                                           This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research              interests in family formation processes in the United States and                in Nepal.  Dr. Axinn plans to expand his research on family                     formation in the United States.  He will examine the mechanisms                 through which children's family formation behavior is influenced                by their parents' family formation and dissolution experiences, and             their educational and financial resources.  He also plans to study              intergenerational influences on childbearing decisions.  Dr.                    Axinn's work on fertility in Nepal will be aimed at understanding               the causes of fertility change in that country.  This research will             provide important insights into the processes resulting in                      fertility decline in non-industrialized settings.",
