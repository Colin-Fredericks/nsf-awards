This network with its connection to regional and national                       networks, will support partnerships, consortia, and multi-                      disciplinary research activities; it will also enable statewide                 access t computing resources, databases, library information                    electronic mail and messaging capabilities.  Specific emphasis                  will be given to Illinois-based information resources and                       research opportunities.  The educational institutions that will                 participate include: Western Illinois Univ., Eastern Illinois                   Univ., Governors State Univ., Northeastern Illinois Univ.,                      Chicago State Univ., Wheaton College, Illinois Benedictine Col.,                Olivet Nazarine Col., Elmhurst Col., College of DuPage, and                     Illinois Valley Community College.                                                                                                                              The network will provide a consistent statewide architecture for                NSFNET access for a broad variety of entities engaged in                        education and research.  This cooperative network will provide                  gateways to regional, national, and international networks and                  will be consistent with their standards.  It will further the                   institutions' work in enhancing the state's economic development                through a well-educated workforce, accessible training                          opportunities, and research and development partnerships.                       Another goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative                      projects and sharing of resources between institutions, including               those outside the state.***",
