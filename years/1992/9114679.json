 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers have developed sophisticated reliability-based bridge               rating procedures to combat the severity of infrastructure                      condition.  the objective of this study is to develop a computer                tool to transfer this bridge rating technology to practicing                    engineers and to provide guidance on how to use this technology.                the computer-sided evaluation package would (1) aid the engineer                in making sound judgement for bridge modeling, (2) perform the                  various rating analyses, (3) provide guidance through the rating                process, and (4) interpret the results of standard in microcomputer             application user-interfaces.  The analysis routines will range from             the simple standard AASHTO procedures to a full-system inelastic                limit state analysis.  A contest-sensitive hypertext system will                be used to train and guide the engineer throughout the rating                   process.  The impact of the system could be enormous given the                  limited computational facilities of most highway departments.  It               would be an efficient and rational tool to use to evaluate the                  safety of the nation's bridges.",
