 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to study the guided-mode                                          resonance properties of periodic dielectric                                     structures in waveguide geometry.                                               Theoretical work indicates that such                                            structures can function as efficient switches                                   and as arbitrarily narrow-band lossless                                         filters.  Both theoretical and experimental                                     work is proposed.  The rigorous coupled-                                        wave theory will be used to study the                                           guided-mode resonance properties of both                                        bulk and surface-relief grating structures in                                   detail.  The resonances will be                                                 characterized with respect to the optical                                       wavelength, grating thickness, angle of                                         incidence, grating period, bulk permittivity,                                   incident-wave polarization and permittivity                                     modulation amplitude.  Multiple dielectric                                      layer geometries will be considered and                                         the performance of the guided-mode                                              resonance filters will be compared with the                                     classical, fundamentally different, Fabry-                                      Perot filters.  The theory will be                                              experimentally tested.  For this, bulk-                                         grating filters will be holographically                                         recorded in a dichromated gelatin                                               waveguide film on glass and quartz                                              substrates.  Surface-relief grating filters will                                be produced in yttrium iron garnet                                              waveguides on gadolinium gallium garnet                                         substrates.  Dynamic, turnable filters will be                                  produced by laser-inducing gratings in                                          photorefractive crystal (GaAs) films.  The                                      significance of the research is that new,                                       fundamental phenomena associated with                                           diffractive structures are being explained.                                     Many useful applications of this work can                                       be envisioned, including laser cavity filters,                                  narrow-line mirrors, tunable filters, electro-                                  optic switches, and enhanced thin-film                                          designs.",
