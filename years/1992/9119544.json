 "awd_abstract_narration": "The precise nature of controls on species distributions and                abundances is the central question in ecology.  Our understanding               of these controls is essential for managing natural and                         artificial systems for both diversity and yield, and for                        predicting and ameliorating the consequences of human impacts,                  including global climate changes.  Biological diversity has                     traditionally been understood as the expression of ecological                   differentiation between species.  More recent interest in the                   adaptive flexibility, or \"plasticity\", of many important species                characteristics has raised a fundamental problem; the more                      plastic a character is, the less it is likely to control species                distributions.  As a result, a major task for ecologists is to                  understand the relative plasticity of species characteristics.                  Previous work suggested that morphology (root--shoot allocation)                might be a key inflexible character in understanding the                        structure and dynamics of vegetation, but a crucial experiment                  failed to confirm this for a well-studied old-field successional                system.  This study will test a new hypothesis that physiology                  (tissue nitrogen concentration) is relatively less plastic than                 morphology and may then be a key characteristic controlling plant               distributions and interactions in this system, and will determine               the range of applicability of this hypothesis.",
