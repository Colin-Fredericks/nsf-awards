 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ten week summer REU program at Clemson University is intended               to provide a group of eight outstanding students with an                        opportunity to participate in highly individualized bioengineering              research activities.  Although the program is geared to                         undergraduate engineering students who may consider graduate                    training in bioengineering, exceptional students from other                     pertinent physical and biological science disciplines will be                   encouraged to enroll in the program, as future bioengineers.  The               program is designed to provide the students with a step-wise                    scenario of a mini-research project.  This will entail:  a) having              basic topical instructions pertinent to bioengineering; b) hands-               on exercise in literature search and outlining of plans for a                   research project; c) exposure to general and specific laboratory                techniques used in bioengineering research; d) observing and taking             part in the planned research activities, recognizing important                  aspects of being a team member among research experimentalists, and             making on the spot decisions in the laboratory environment; and e)              recording, analyzing, presenting technical data, as well as making              technical judgements on results with supported conclusions.                     Program attributes and associated impact include encouraging                    outstanding engineering and science undergraduate students to                   pursue graduate training in bioengineering and preparing                        undergraduate students who are to seek the job market with valuable             research experience.",
