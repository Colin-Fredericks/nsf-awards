 "awd_abstract_narration": "The normal program of early embryonic development is initiated                  when an oocyte is fertilized by a sperm.  The mechanism by which                sperm activate oocytes and the role of sperm components in this                 process and in later stages of embryogenesis are not understood.                This project takes a combined genetic and molecular approach to                 studying this problem, using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans                as a model system.  The PI has already identified a gene that                   encodes a sperm-supplied product that is required for initiation                of the correct program of early embryonic development in C.                     elegans.  Mutations in this gene, called spe-11, result in                      paternal-effect embryonic lethality: wild-type oocytes, when                    fertilized by sperm from mutant worms, undergo very abnormal                    early development and die.  This is not due to the presence of a                \"poisonous product\" in mutant sperm but to reduced levels or                    absence of wild-type product.  Thus, wild-type spe-11 product                   participates, either directly or indirectly, in initiating the                  normal program of early development in C. elegans.  This project                has two major aims: 1) To clone and molecularly characterize the                spe-11 gene, and localize the spe-11 gene product in sperm and                  newly fertilized embryos.  2) To carry out screens for additional               paternal-effect embryonic-lethal mutations, which will identify                 other genes that encode sperm-supplied factors required for                     normal embryo development.  This effort will complement the                     wealth of information on oocyte factors and will begin to define                the sperm's contributions to early embryogenesis.",
