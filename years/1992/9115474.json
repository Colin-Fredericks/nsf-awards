 "awd_abstract_narration": "Equilibria, kinetics, and optical and infrared photochemistry                   of ions in the gas-phase will be explored. The studies will be                  accomplished primarily with ion cyclotron resonance (ICR)                       spectroscopy combined with conventional and laser light                         sources. An underlying theme of this study will be to develop                   an understanding of the intrinsic chemistry of highly reactive                  ions in relationship to their structure when they are removed                   from the stabilizing forces of solvent or crystals. Reactions                   that will be studied in the gas-phase are the SN2 reaction,                     acyl transfer reactions, reactions at unsaturated carbon,                       proton transfer processes, electron transfer reactions, energy                  transfer processes, and reactions of complex ions.                              %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing research of Professor John I. Brauman at Stanford                    University. Most of the current knowledge of reactions                          involving ions (charged species ) is in solution where the                      solvent greatly influences the reactions and properties of                      ions. Professor Brauman will continue his studies of the                        reactions of ions in the gas-phase, where the stabilizing                       effect of the solvent is no longer present. Under the                           conditions afforded by the gas-phase, the intrinsic chemistry                   of highly reactive ions will be studied in relationship to                      their structure.",
