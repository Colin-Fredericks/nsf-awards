 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general field chemistry characterization in the subfield                 of mass spectrometry.  The objective of this project is to                      determine the feasibility of the matrix-assisted laser desorption               (MALD) technique on a triple electrostatic sector time-of-flight                mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) for the analysis of bio-organic                      compounds.  This particular TOF-MS was developed at CHARLES EVANS               AND ASSOCIATES and features high mass resolution (theoretical                   limit of c.a. 10,000 (FWHM), excellent mass accuracy (ppm range)                and special stigmatic ion optics which permit direct ion imaging                over a large (200 micrometer) field of view.  A Nd:YAG laser will               be added to this instrument to study this instrument's                          suitability to high molecular weight biopolymer analysis.                       Currently available MALD-TOF systems have shown promising and                   useful data in this application but suffer from poor mass                       resolution.  The ability to generate data at higher mass                        resolution will provide significant advances in the biomolecular                sciences.  High mass resolution MALD-TOF spectrometry could                     distinguish different adducts or modifications of a molecular                   species as well as explore the heterogeneity which is common in                 biopolymers.  Should implementation of this technique prove                     feasible, widespread applications in the fields of protein and                  peptide chemistry and structural biology in general are                         anticipated.",
