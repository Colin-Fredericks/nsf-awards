 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental premise of the Labor Management Reporting and                     Disclosure Act of 1959 is that if the democratic rights of union                members are protected, the members can eliminate corruption and                 racketeering.  Currently there is a great deal of debate about the              use of civil actions such as the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt                   Organization Act (RICO) and the remedy of government-imposed                    trusteeships to control union corruption.  None of these measures               have proved to be entirely successful in combating union                        corruption.  To date, there has been no empirical inquiry into when             and to what extent the premises of these Acts are functionally                  valid, nor has there been systematic examination of what legal                  measures may be necessary to encourage development of reform                    movements and establish democratic processes in racketeer                       controlled unions.                                                                                                                                              This doctoral disseration project will analyze why these efforts                have not succeeded in the past and how democratic reform has                    functioned or failed to function.  Since the Teamsters Union                    presents the best example of the failure of unions to combat                    corruption, the study will encompass four generations of democratic             reform in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.  Sources for              the study will include internal union documents, trial testimony,               rank and file literature and government documents from the National             Labor Relations Board, and congressional hearings.                                                                                                              This project will provide an empirical base and systematic factual              analysis for understanding the phenomena of corruption in unions,               potentials for internal correction by reform movements, and the                 role of union democracy in allowing and correcting various forms                of corruption and racketeering.  The results will not only                      contribute to basic knowledge about the impact of law but will be               directly relevant to unions which want to protect themselves from               racketeer infiltration, to law enforcement officials and judges who             attempt to design remedies in specific cases, and to regulators and             legislators who must develop general rules regulating internal                  union affairs.",
