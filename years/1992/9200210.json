 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problems of ignition and propagation of a thermal front in                  a catalytic converter will be studied theoretically and                         experimentally in order to gain a better understanding of the                   factors controlling these phenomena.  A preliminary                             theoretical analysis utilizing non-linear dynamics and                          bifurcation theory will be extended to analysis of more                         complex models.  Experimentally, macroscopic thermal wave                       propagation will be investigated via infrared thermography                      studies on unsupported model substrates, studies on supported                   model catalysts, and studies on a section of a catalytic                        converter.  In addition, the issue of communication between                     two reactive spots (communications between individual catalyst                  particles) will be similarly experimentally investigated.                       Finally, a new radial catalytic converter design which is                       predicted on the basis of preliminary analysis to have                          particularly desirable characteristics as regards fast                          ignition and thermal front propagation will be studied                          further.                                                                                                                                                        Evolving air pollution regulations for automobiles have the                     effect of requiring that catalytic converters come up to full                   effective operation with a minimal time delay subsequent to                     engine startup, making the development of catalytic converters                  with minimal ignition delay and rapid thermal front                             propagation highly important.  Accordingly, a major goal of                     this program is development of an understanding of the                          critical phenomena (fundamental mechanisms) which will lead to                  design of more efficient fast-igniting catalytic converters                     without the onerous requirement of external heating sources                     (an alternative approach to \"fixing\" the cold startup                           emissions problem.",
