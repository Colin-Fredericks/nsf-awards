 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mosses, perhaps because of their small size and seemingly                  inconspicuous role in nature, have been little studied genetically              or phylogenetically.  Based on what data do exist, mosses appear                to show ranges of genetic variation similar to that known for other             land plants.  There is little understanding, however, of the                    influence of ecological determinants and life history                           characteristics on the genetic structure of natural moss                        populations.  Like homosporous ferns, moss species show a high                  incidence of polyploidy (multiple sets of chromosomes), nearly 80%.             Unlike other land plants, however, most polyploid moss species have             been presumed to arise locally and spontaneously, that is by                    autopolyploidy, rather than by hybridization with nearby species,               or allopolyploidy.                                                                   Faculty adviser Robert Wyatt will direct graduate student                  Gregory Derda in an intensive genetic survey of several species of              the hair-cap mosses of the Pacific Northwest, a region of great                 diversity in this group.  They will use horizontal starch-gel                   electrophoresis to determine levels of genetic variation in several             species, including groups where polyploidy is known or suspected.               On the basis of fixed heterozygosity of allozymes, it appears that              both Polytrichum ohioense and P. pallidisetum are allopolyploids,               one progenitor of each being P. commune.  But the other progenitors             are unknown.  A thorough survey of genetic markers of all species               in the region should reveal likely ancestral stocks, and provide                data for analysis of phylogenetic relationships among the numerous              species.  As well, the study will reveal what levels of genetic                 variation are correlated with areas of glacial refugia in the                   Pacific Northwest and in areas of recent colonization.",
