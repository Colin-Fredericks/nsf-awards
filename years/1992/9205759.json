 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research centers on stochastic inequalities,                  including correlation inequalities, monotonicity of certain                     expectations with respect to parameters of distributions,                       inequalities which quantify dependence structures, and related                  notions of multivariate total positivity.  The emphasis is on                   multivariate distributions and processes.  The proposal also                    refers to dependence concepts arising in sequential analysis and                the study of optimal stopping value comparisons under various                   dependence structures, and prophet inequalities which provide                   upper bounds on optimal stopping values.  Limit theorems for                    various types of dependence structures will be studied, with                    initial emphasis on approximation rates.  The resulting improved                convergence rates may be applicable to the study of asymptotics                 of multivariate statistics which can be expressed as sums of                    dependent random variables and various random counts arising in                 problems of combinatorial nature.                                                    The assumptions of statistical independence of sampled                     measurements is basic to most methods of data analysis, and is                  ubiquitous in problems of stochastic optimization.  However, one                encounters many situations in which this assumption is violated.                The proposed research centers on the study of certain aspects of                samples which consist of observations which are not independent.",
