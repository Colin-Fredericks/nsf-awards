 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem to be addressed is:  given N players who each                  compete and receive scores in different subsets of M tournaments                that are not necessarily equally difficult, find a rating that                  represents the quality of each player's performance over the course             of a period of time.  By symmetry, ratings of the tournaments'                  difficulty are also produced.                                                        The research will develop the theory behind several rating                 procedures for this problem that have been used in the context of               rating professional golfers and airlines' on-time performance,                  thereby laying the foundation for applications of greater                       substantive import.  Future applications may include problems such              as ranking students (i.e., improving on the use of simple GPA's)                and performance evaluations (possibly overcoming the perennial                  problem of inflation in evaluation scores.                                           There is no one 'correct' rating procedure.  The goal of this              research is to describe some reasonable candidates and develop                  criteria that help one decide which procedure is best suited to a               particular application.  This is analogous to examining properties              such as unbiasedness, consistency, and efficiency when choosing                 from among various possible estimators in statistical problems.",
