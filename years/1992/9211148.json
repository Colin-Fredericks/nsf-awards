 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adaptive finite element techniques provide a reliable, robust,                and efficient means of solving the complex partial differential                 equations that arise in practice.  Likewise, parallel computation               is becoming indispensable in the solution of modern large-scale                 scientific engineering computational problems.  We propose to                   investigate parallel and adaptive procedures for solving vector                 systems of three-dimensional time-dependent parabolic equations.                With a goal of developing the most efficient techniques, we will                emphasize adaptive procedures that include both mesh modification               (refinement and coarsening) and variation of the order of the                   finite element procedure.  In a similar spirit, we will                         concentrate on massive parallelism using SIMD and MIMD                          architectures.                                                                    Resulting software will be capable of solving problems on                     arbitrary three-dimensional problem domains using a finite octree               automatic mesh generation procedure.  This tree structure, which                manages data associated with mesh generation and adaptive mesh                  refinement, with further be used to schedule parallel processors                so that loading is balanced and to map spatial regions to various               parallel architectures.  Likewise, we will explore procedures                   that utilize the a posteriori error estimates, furnished with the               adaptive software, to estimate the work remaining in different                  portions of the problem domain and schedule processors                          accordingly.",
