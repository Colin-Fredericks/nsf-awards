 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a long term visit by                    Professor John Lamancusa of Pennsylvania State University to the                University of Siegen, Germany, where he will collaborate with                   Professor Hans Eschenauer of the Research Laboratory for                        Structural Optimization.  The objective of their research is to                 develop methods and computational tools for designing quiet                     mechanical structures constructed of advanced composite materials.              Dr. Lamancusa and his research group bring to the collaboration                 expertise in the fields of acoustic propagation, prediction and                 structural vibrations.  This is complemented by the German group's              multidisciplinary expertise in optimization.  They have developed               innovative methods for shape optimization of large, composite                   structures with static and dynamic performance criteria.  The long              term cooperative research visit by Dr. Lamancusa will facilitate a              sharing of expertise in structural acoustics and the science of                 optimization between two of the premier international institutions in           those fields.                                                                                                                                                   Recent advances in structural and acoustic analysis techniques now              make it possible to predict the acoustic performance of complicated             structures before fabrication.  Meanwhile, improved computing                   resources and optimization methods have made structural                         optimization feasible for complex structures with many variables.               These techniques have not been applied yet to the acoustical design             of structures of non-traditional materials.  This project will address          the feasibility and special problems inherent in the optimal design             of composite material structures for acoustical performance.",
