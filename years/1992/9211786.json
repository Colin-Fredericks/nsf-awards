Like the previous symposia organized by the                              PI in October 1985, October 1986, April 1988 and                                May 1990, this conference will bring together                                   researchers from universities, industrial and                                   governmental research laboratories, and the industry,                           working in the field of Quantum 1/f Noise and other                             low frequency fluctuations.  To explain why funding                             this Symposium makes sense, this proposal focuses                               on the description of the present state and of the                              research directions in the field of Quantum 1/f Noise,                          although other low frequency fluctuations are also                              included (as in 1988 and 1990), in order to widen the                           scope of the Symposium and the pool of participants.",
