 "awd_abstract_narration": "Political parties, political action committees, and individuals who             make large contributions comprise the most important sources of                 money in congressional election campaigns.  These actors have                   improved their institutional resources and increased their campaign             activities since the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act               of 1971 and its amendments.  Nevertheless, political scientists                 know relatively little about how the development of these actors                has influenced their contribution stragegies in elections for the               U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.                              One school of thought holds that those who invest large sums of                 money in federal elections adapt gradually to their environment and             are therefore slow to change their contribution strategies.  This               body of theory would predict that PACs, parties and individuals                 would have difficulty departing from established patterns of                    behavior, even under radically different circumstances.  A second               school of thought maintains that campaign contributors are                      strategic actors who constantly survey the political environment                in order to take advantage of opportunities created by political                change.  This theory would predict that parties, PACs, and                      individuals would rapidly adjust their contribution behavior in                 response to an altered political environment.                                   The 1992 election cycle promises to be radically different from                 those held during the last 12 years because of a confluence of                  factors, including redistricting, a large number of congressional               retirements, a presidential election, and political scandals.                   These factors will lead to an election cycle characterized by many              highly qualified candidates competing for a limited reservoir of                money.  The unusual qualities of the 1992 elections provide the                 research team with a unique opportunity to assess the two schools               of thought.                                                                     This investigation will examine changes in patterns of party, PAC,              and individual contributions to incumbents, challengers, open-seat              contestants, Democrats, and Republicans over the course of the 1978             through 1992 election cycles.  It will assess the impact of                     national political conditions, such as the state of the economy,                the popularity of the president, and political scandals, on the                 strategies of these contributors.  It will evaluate how                         organizational development and learning have affected their                     campaign decision making.  It will also evaluate the impact that                Washington-based organizations, such as national party committees               and lead PACs, have on the contributions of individuals and other               organized contributors.                                                         The project will culminate in a unique and comprehensive set of                 campaign finance data.  It will lead to the development of several              generalizations about the organizational evolution of political                 parties and PACs.  It will also enhance our understanding of how                these organizations and individuals interact in the context of                  congressional election campaigns.",
