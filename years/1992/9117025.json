 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This project supports participation by Dr. A. Saeed                of the Government College, Lahore, Pakistan, and Dr. S. Murad of                the University of Illinois at Chicago in a research project                     dealing with the method of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics                    (NEMD).  The research at U. Illinois involves the use of NEMD                   simulation methods to evaluate and develop techniques for                       predicting transport properties, including viscosity and thermal                conductivity, of dense fluid mixtures.  At the Government College               it will involve the use of the same methods for study of the                    structure of solids.  Dr. Saeed will spend several weeks each                   summer during the next two years to acquire sufficient experience               with NEMD techniques to develop the research at his home                        institute in Lahore.  Dr. Murad will travel to Lahore to work on                the research plan, to give seminars at the three main                           universities in that city, and to participate in a one-week                     workshop on computer simulation techniques.                                                                                                                     Scope:  This project addresses an area of science which is                      gaining increased importance by utilizing high speed computers                  for simulating complex engineering and scientific problems.  The                area is particularly suitable for developing countries where the                cost of sophisticated experimental equipment is often                           prohibitive, and the use of computer simulation is an attractive                alternative.  The project fits the Science in developing Program                well by allowing for the training of a scientist from Pakistan                  and to have him participate in research in the U.S.",
