 "awd_abstract_narration": "Myxococcus exhibits multicellular gliding movements that are highly             coordinated.  Coordination spans the range of few to many thousands             of cells.  While growing, a dozen cells may associate and move as               a cohort.  In fruiting body development, many thousands of cells                move coordinately.  The aim of this project is to work out the                  cellular and molecular basis for movement coordination.  Despite                the apparent complexity of their movement, myxobacterial cells have             the structural, chemical and genetic simplicity of Gram-negative                bacteria.  Previous work on Myxococcus had distinguished two                    motility patterns called \"adventurous\" and \"social\".  This project              will seek to identify many of the genes that control social                     motility.  The motors responsible for gliding movement have not yet             been uncovered in any of the gliding bacteria.  A new way to find               the genes that specify gliding motors is proposed.  One gene, the               mglA gene, is known from previous work to be essential for all                  gliding and to couple adventurous and social motility.  Mutants                 defective in this gene are unable to move under any conditions.                 Experiments are proposed to define the function of mglA on the                  pathway that regulates cell movement.  Multicellular movements are              particularly important in the embryonic development of vertebrates,             but little is known about how they are organized or regulated.                  Myxobacteria offer a realistic way to begin to investigate this                 general problem.",
