 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses two major inconsistencies between modern                 macroeconomic theories of business cycles and the empirical                     evidence.  Positive shocks in the money supply depress both real                and nominal interest rates, at least in the short run.  Standard                general equilibrium theory, with its emphasis on the alleged role               of \"sticky\" nominal wages and prices in explaining the                          expansionary effects of monetary policy, would predict the                      opposite relationship.  This project determines whether or not                  the explanation for this first inconsistency lies in an                         alternative (possibly complementary) channel, one which                         emphasizes the role of working capital in the production process                and the liquidity effects of changes in the money supply.  The                  second inconsistency is the phenomenon of procyclical                           productivity.  Productivity tends to fall in downturns and rise                 in upturns.  This seems to contradict neoclassical theories of                  business cycles because changes in aggregate output should                      conform to the law of diminishing marginal productivity, i.e., as               the percentage of the labor force employed declines (increases),                the productivity of the marginal worker should increase                         (decrease).  This project determines whether or not procyclical                 productivity is due to the effect of labor hoarding and changes                 in capacity utilization.                                                                                                                                        The project should provide new insights into the role of monetary               policy as an impulse to postwar US business cycles.                             Specifically, it will improve our understanding of the role of                  liquidity effects as central components of the monetary                         transmission mechanism.  The project analyzes the impact of                     monetary policy on financial markets and the observed dynamic co-               movements between short term interest rates, output and the money               supply.  The project also improves our understanding of the                     dynamic co-movements between average productivity, hours worked                 and output.  In this research the focus is on the role which                    labor hoarding and time varying capacity capital utilization                    rates play in generating the observed procyclicality of labor                   productivity and the Solow residual.  This in turn leads to an                  investigation of how these phenomena impact on existing estimates               of the role of technology shocks in generating economic                         fluctuations.",
