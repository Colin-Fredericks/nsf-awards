 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regulation of defenses against solar ultraviolet radiation-                 induced photooxidative stress in sea urchins will be studied. Like              other marine organisms, sea urchins contain mycosporine-like amino              acids (MAAs), which absorb environmentally relevant wavelengths of              UV (310-360 nm). MAAs are presumably algal, bacterial or fungal                 products, animals not being known to synthesize them, so their                  provenance in sea urchins is uncertain. Various seaweeds are rich               in MAAs, and preliminary chromatographic analyses indicate                      concordance between the MAA complements in seaweeds and in sea                  urchin tissues, especially ovaries. Maintenance of sea urchins on               controlled diets of seaweeds lacking or rich in MAAs, subsequent                analysis of gut contents and tissues, testing the ability of gut                tissues to absorb MAAs should confirm whether MAAs are so obtained.             Dietary fortification of sea urchin ovaries should confer a greater             resistance to UV in eggs and larvae, and UV effects on                          fertilization, development, and larval survival will be assessed in             MAA-rich and deficient specimens. It is also planned to discern the             particular membrane fractions. Possible radical scavenging                      functions of gadusol (structurally similar to MAAs) present in eggs             will be assessed in parallel experiments, since some UV effects are             mediated by oxyradicals. The results will have implications for the             mechanism of accumulation of photooxidative defenses in marine food             chains, a genuine concern as the protective ozone layer                         deteriorates.",
