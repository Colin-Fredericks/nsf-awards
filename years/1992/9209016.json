 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kin recognition is a fundamental mechanism in animal behavior.                  Many animal species, including humans, are able to discriminate                 between close relatives and other individuals of the same                       species, and to behave preferentially to close relatives.  Often,               the signals used by animals to make these discriminations are                   odors, but only in the honey bee have specific chemical compounds               been identified that enable animals to tell relatives from non-                 relatives.  This project will provide new information on how                    these odors are used by honey bees, will identify additional such               odors, and will enhance our understanding of how the production                 of odors is inherited.  In a practical sense, the project will                  suggest new ways to manipulate honey bee colonies so that                       beekeeping practices may be improved.  The results may prove to                 be particularly important in suggesting ways of preventing the                  African honey bee from disrupting beekeeping operations.",
