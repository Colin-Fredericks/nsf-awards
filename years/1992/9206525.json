 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigation of self-splicing Group II intorns (GIIs) from the                 motochondria of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that              GII transcripts undergo self-splicing to yield intron lariats and               spliced exons.  GII and nuclear pre-mRNA introns use similar                    chemical mechanisms; consequently, analysis of GII reactions will               further understanding of nuclear pre-mRNA splicing.  GIIs are                   organized into discrete secondary structure domains; this suggest               that each domain has a definite three dimensional shape that forms              independenlty and is maintained in the presence of other domains.               Assembly of the tertiary structure of the whoe intron depends on                specific contacts between domains.  Structural study of isolated                domains, mapping interdomain contacts, and assessment of the                    interchangability domains from different GIIs is proposed.                      This project will determine catalytically critical substrate                    contacts between Domains 5 (D5) and other domains.  D5 is required              for both steps of splicing.  Mutant derivatives of D5 will be                   prepared systematically to alter the structure and evaluate the                 function of D5 quantitatively.  These changes will target sites                 that are highly conserved among D5s.  Kinetic parameters and                    structural requirements for splicing related reactions will be                  determined.  D5 (or derivatives) will be combined with Domain 6                 (D6) to analyze their functional cooperation.  D6 contains the                  branch site that attacks the 5' splice site in the first step of                splicing.  D5 and D6 will be tested with Exon 2 to study the second             step of splicing.  To identify the site of D5 action, D5 will be                prepared with photoactive reagents and crosslinked to the intron.               Finally, chemical synthesis will yield enough D5 for direct                     structural analysis.  RNA catalysis is a widespread biological                  phenomenon; this project offers insight into the chemical mechanism             of a unique RNA catalyst.                                                       %%%                                                                             In the cell nucleus of plants and animals, genes are assembled from             mosiacs of expressed and intervening sequences by a process called              RNA splicing.  All cells with nuclei first make long RNA molecules              by copying the DNA directly.  The cells then cut and join the large             RNA molecules to assemble mature messenger RNAs that will be                    translated in the cytoplasm to express proteins.  The process of                RNA splicing must be efficient and accurate to allow functional                 proteins to be produced.  The cellular machinery for RNA splicing               is extraodinarily complex, to allow for fine control of gene                    expression in development, brain function, and the immune system.               We know that many genetic abnormalities are associated with faulty              RNA splicing, so developing rational and effective treatments will              require a thorough description of the process of RNA splicing.  The             RNA splicing machinery is built up with several small RNAs in                   assemblies with proteins and dozens of additional protein                       molecules. Because there are so many different parts, it is hard                biochemically to analyze RNA splicing from higher cells in detail.              This project will analyze a special kind of RNA splicing machinery              that operates in the mitochondrion, the energy producing                        compartment of yeast cells. This special RNA splicing reaction uses             the same chemistry as splicing in plant and animal cells, but only              RNA molecules are needed in this case.  We are studying how two                 different RNA molecules recognize and bind to each other                        specifically and then work together to carry out the reaction of                splicing.  In particular , we will find out what parts of each                  molecule are needed for splicing and where each molecule touches                the other one.  We want to produce a very detailed picture of the               molecular structure of these two RNA molecules.  This work will                 provide a better understanding of RNA splicing as it occurs in                  cells and a more precise picture of catalytic strategies that may               be used by RNA enzymes.  Another benefit of this project will be                the possible rational design of antibiotics to prevent growth of                yeast and fungus pathogens that afflict humans, animals, and crops              plants, since animal cells do not use this special type of RNA                  splicing that is found in virtually all fungi.",
