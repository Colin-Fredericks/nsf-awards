 "awd_abstract_narration": "Operating procedures have a strong impact on the performance                    of chemical processing systems.  These operating procedures                     must ensure safe and reliable operation by incorporating                        features such as verifiability of procedure steps and                           satisfaction of quality constraints.  Operating procedure                       synthesis needs to be complemented by the availability of                       appropriate flowsheet structures which provide the necessary                    infrastructure for processing that satisfies the required                       specifications.  Relevant structural characteristics may be                     equipment redundancy, presence of auxiliary equipment, bypass                   and purge lines and other structures whose function is to                       allow safe and reliable transitions from one operating state                    to another.  This project is aimed at the simultaneous design                   of both an economically viable chemical manufacturing process                   and the operating procedure for its safe and reliable                           operation.                                                                                                                                                      The PI's strategy introduces structural actions (operators) as                  options for producing high integrity sets of operating                          procedures for chemical processing systems, allowing synthesis                  of operating procedures in otherwise infeasible situations.                     The incorporation of \"stationary states\" in the original                        flowsheet is used to increase process flexibility and add                       modularity and verifiability to the operating procedures.  The                  methodology requires as input: the initial flowsheet                            description, local and global constraints, the initial and                      goal states, possible procedural and structural actions, a                      unit model library, and safety/reliability and economic                         evaluation functions.  It produces sets of process flowsheets                   and corresponding operating procedures.  The methodology will                   be checked against actual industrial test cases.",
