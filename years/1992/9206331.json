 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to begin to unravel the control                 circuits of light-regulated seedling development using Arabidopsis              thaliana mutants, the de-etiolated mutants (det).  Previous work in             my laboratory has shown that recessive mutations in any one of four             DET genes uncouple light signals from a number of light-dependent               processes, resulting in dark-grown plants that grow as light-grown              seedlings.  Because det mutations are both recessive and                        pleiotropic, we have proposed that the wild-type DET proteins play              a negative regulatory role in light-regulated gene expression and               development in Arabidopsis.  The genetic, biochemical, and                      molecular experiments proposed here seek to further define these                genes, with emphasis placed on the DET1 gene and its protein                    product, DET1.  A major objective of the proposed experiments is to             complete the cloning the DET1 locus.  We are cloning DET1 by                    chromosome walking from a nearby RFLP marker.  We have cloned over              1 megabase of DNA around the chromosome walk is almost finished.                The DET1 gene will be used in biochemical and genetic experiments               to begin analysis of the molecular mechanisms of how light signals              are transduced to developmental strategies.  To further elucidate               the role of DET1 in the negative regulation of the light response,              we have isolated extragenic suppressors of the det1-1 mutation.                 These suppressors will be mapped and extensively characterized in               the det1- and DET+ backgrounds with respect to light-regulated gene             expression, pigment synthesis, and leaf and chloroplast                         development.  Finally, we plan to investigate the functional                    interactions between the various det genes and other genes involved             in light signal transduction by constructing doubly mutant strains              carrying both det and various other photomorphogenetic mutations                that have been previously isolated by ourselves and others.  The                interactions between the various det genes will also be determined              by analysis of doubly, triply, and quadruply mutant lines.                      %%%                                                                             The date from these experiments will allow us to construct models               of the mechanisms by which light and other signals control                      chloroplast development in plants.  Arabidopsis thaliana is                     uniquely suited for these studies due to its small genome size,                 high seed yield, low level of interspersed repetitive DNA, and                  transformability.",
