 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a team of cultural anthropologists (two                   based on the mainland US and one in Puerto Rico) studying the                   effect of cultural background on people's responses to pain.  The               investigators will collect qualitative information through                      intensive interviews and quantitative information through                       questionnaires with 100 native Puerto Rican patients suffering                  chronic pain, and compare the results with those from a prior                   study of Anglo Americans and U.S. mainland Hispanics (mainly of                 Puerto Rican descent).  The aim of the comparison is to test the                hypothesis that socialization within cultural groups influences                 attitudes and attention to pain which then affects the psycho-                  physiological processes of pain perception.  The study will be                  attentive to factors influences intra-cultural variation in pain                response also.                                                                                                                                                  This study is important because it will contribute to our                       knowledge of the ways cultural orientation shapes human's ability               to withstand suffering.  At a time when chronic back pain seems                 to be common, understanding of this sort can clearly help society               cope with the affliction.                                                                                                                                       One of the researchers is handicapped (with chronic pain) and                   this support involves special aids to handicapped researchers.",
