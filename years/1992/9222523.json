 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ocean technologies have significant economic and                       scientific impact to our nation.  An Industry/University                        Cooperative Research Center on Ocean Technology at the University               of Rhode Island could provide a better mechanism to advance the                 development and application of basic research on ocean                          technologies.                                                                        A planning meeting will study if industry will support an                  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Ocean Technology             to be headquartered at the University of Rhode Island.  The meeting             will asses industry interest and determine if the Center has                    sufficient support and merit to meet the Industry/University                    Cooperative Research Centers Program criteria.  The proposed                    research projects will address:1) development of analytical                     techniques for environmental monitoring; 2) equipment development               and testing; 3) development of hardware and software for collection             and processing of under water acoustics and optics data.                             The Principal Investigator is recognized as an eminent                     researcher and has the resource for this planning meeting.                           This project has been coordinated with Dr. Norman Caplan,                  Program Director of the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in              the Division of Biological and Critical Systems at the National                 Science Foundation.                                                                  The Program Director recommends the University of Rhode Island             be awarded $9,892 for one year for this planning meeting.",
