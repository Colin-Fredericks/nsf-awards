This approach, known as syntactic                 bootstrapping, involves the use of syntactic information about                  verbs to constrain inferences about their meaning.  One line of                 research looks at the judgments of adult speakers of English to                 ask what inferences from syntax to semantics are supported by the               language.  Subjects will make judgments of semantic similarity                  between verbs, building up a picture of semantic relatedness                    within a set of verbs.  Other subjects will judge sentences for                 acceptability, providing information about the structural                       properties of the same verbs.  Statistical comparisons of these                 two data sets will determine whether various syntactic                          distinctions among verbs match semantic differences.  A second                  line of research explores what children know about syntax/meaning               relations, and whether they will make form-to-meaning inferences                in interpreting novel verbs.  Preschoolers are shown video-taped                scenes, and asked to interpret a nonsense verb used to describe                 them.  The question of interest here is whether their                           interpretations of the same scene change depending on the                       sentence structure in which the nonsense verb is presented.",
