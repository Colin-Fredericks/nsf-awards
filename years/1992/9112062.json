 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop two new operational modes of x-ray                        microscopes which will make use of phase contrast for imaging                   thick, hydrated biological specimens with 60 nm or better                       resolution.  Compared to current to current x-ray microscopes                   which use absorption contrast, phase contrast microscopes offer                 the promise of higher intrinsic contrast at certain wavelengths                 and thus reduced radiation dose, plus the possibility of improved               penetration and depth of field for thick specimens.  A                          Holographic Phase Contrast X-ray Microscope will be developed                   which will use a photoresist detector to record with high spatial               resolution the interference pattern between a reference wave and                a wave which has undergone amplitude and phase changes by passage               through the specimen; the complex specimen wave will be recovered               by numerical hologram reconstruction.  A Differential Phase                     Contrast X-ray Microscope will be developed which will use a                    Fresnel zone plate to form a focusses x-ray spot through which a                sample is scanned, and which will use an optical lever detector                 to measure refractive index gradients as well as x-ray absorption               in the sample.  Operation of these microscopes will be verified                 by imaging test objects, and then their operation will be                       demonstrated using a variety of hydrated and unsectioned                        biological specimens.",
