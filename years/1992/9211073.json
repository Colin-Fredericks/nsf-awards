 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallelism inherent in the computationally intensive problems                arising in the simulation of advanced electron devices will be                  identified and exploited for the development of novel software                  tools.  Advances, both in the optimization of algorithms for use                on specific machines such as a MasPar MP-1216, as well as in the                simulation of hitherto unexplored device phenomena are targeted.                Previous research involved the development of a numerically                     intensive simulator for quantum transport in nanostructured                     semiconductor devices.  A rich set of matrix problems drawn from                this work, including complex valued linear systems solutions,                   eigenvalue problems as well as QR, and SV decompositions on                     regularly structured matrices, have been identified as candidates               for future work on parallel processing machines.  Quite similar                 matrix problems arise also in the treatment of electromagnetic                  waveguides, and the scope of this work can be readily expanded                  to include problems in this field as well.",
