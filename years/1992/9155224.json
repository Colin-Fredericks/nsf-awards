 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program provides opportunity for high school biology                       teachers to spend a summer doing research, full-time, in the                    laboratory of a member of the American Society of Biochemistry                  and Molecular Biology (ASBMB).  This nationwide program                         emphasizes the identification and selection of highly motivated                 teachers who will return to their home schools and have a                       continuing impact on the quality of science education through the               implementation of innovative topics and hands-on exercises.                     Emphasis is placed on the recruitment of teachers from schools                  that serve large numbers of minority students.  On the basis of                 previous experience, it is anticipated that this program will                   have an impact on science education at the secondary level and                  have at least an indirect impact on career choices made by some                 secondary students.                                                                                                                                             Cost sharing equals 180 % of the NSF award.",
