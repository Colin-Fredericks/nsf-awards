 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric turbulent energy degrades itself into smaller scales                of motion until its energy is converted entirely to heat, sound,                and light.   The convective granular motions of the outer envelope              of the Sun and other cool stars are thought to convert their energy             into acoustical energy, which is thought to play a key role in the              heating of the outer atmosphere (chromosphere) of the Sun.  Just                how important this role may be is still controversial as an error               has been found in important assumptions that have been made in the              past to evaluate acoustical heating in the solar chromosphere.                  The Principal Investigator and his collaborator, F. Cattaneo, plan              an extensive set of computer numerical simulations in which the                 excitation of acoustical energy will be computed from a set of                  equations describing turbulence in a three-dimensional                          compressional fluid.  In addition, their experiments will include               the effects of turbulence in plasma containing tubes of magnetic                flux, such as are thought to be important on the Sun's surface.                 The computations of acoustic energy will be used to compute heating             from sound waves which can be directly compared to the cooling of               the chromopheres of the Sun and other stars from X-ray                          observations.  It is anticipated that this work will put the                    estimates of acoustical energy in star's atmospheres on a firm,                 experimental basis and should permit estimates of the minimum                   amounts of mass that stars can lose through a heating of their                  outer atmospheres.  In addition, it may lead to applications of                 the dissipation of energy from loud acoustical sources on the                   Earth (e.g. jet engines).",
