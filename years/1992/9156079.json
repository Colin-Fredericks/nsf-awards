 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed at a comprehensive redesign of the three-                 course introductory computer science sequence for undergraduate                 computer and information science majors.  The course sequence                   wasexamined in the light of the new ACM/IEEE report \"Computing                  Curricula '91\" to ascertain how best to revise the courses to                   bring them closer to recommended curricula in the report.  Some                 of the fundamental and recurring concepts identified in the                     ACM/IEEE report, such as complexity of large programs, levels                   of abstraction, the concept of binding, abstract data types,                    evolution of requirements, and the importance of software                       reuse, are not adequately represented in the current                            curriculum.  The project introduces these concepts through the                  introduction of object-oriented theory, software engineering                    concepts, and object-oriented programming and design in the                     introductory curriculum.  It is believed that the object-                       oriented approach will prove more effective in introducing the                  fundamental and recurring concepts identified above.  The                       objective of the proposed revision is to bring the introductory                 computer science curriculum more in line with the current                       state-of-the-art of software development technology.  The                       project will provide the students with access to class                          libraries, thus enabling them to develop moderately large and                   realistic projects using contemporary application development                   environments.  The aim is to better prepare the students for                    advanced undergraduate courses, graduate studies, and the                       competitive job market.  The changes are consistent with the                    sample course descriptions in the report \"Computing Curricula                   '91\", hence it is believed that the results should be                           generalizable to a large number of computer science                             departments.",
