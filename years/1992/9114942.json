 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                       research project between Professor Fred Anson, Department of                    Chemistry, California Institute of Technology, and Professor                    Eishun Tsuchida, Department of Polymer Chemistry, Waseda                        University, Tokyo, Japan.  The research will focus on                           electrochemistry in polymer films on electrode surfaces.                                                                                                        Professor Anson's research group will perform electrochemical                   measurements on solutions of soluble polymers and polyelectrolytes              as well as polymeric coatings on electrode surfaces in which                    electroactive species are incorporated.  Catalysis of electron                  transfer reactions at electrodes and charge propagation rates in                coatings are among the objectives of the research.  Professor                   Tsuchida's group will prepare and characterize the novel polymer                and polyelectrolyte samples that are to be tested by the Anson                  group.  Both groups will be concerned with the mechanism and                    optimization of the oxidative homogeneous polymerization and                    electropolymerization of thiophenols and diaryldisulfides.  The                 collaboration will bring novel polymers and monomers into                       Professor Anson's program and will bring additional                             electrochemical expertise into Professor Tsuchida's program.",
