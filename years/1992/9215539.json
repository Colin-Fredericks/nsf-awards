 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two-day planning workshop will be held in Washington, DC, to                  consider in detail the current state of undergraduate cognitive                 science education and to issue recommendations for future                       directions.  The workshop was initially suggested in the final                  report of the 1991 planning workshop for the cognitive science                  initiative at the National Science Foundation.  It will be attended             by approximately sixteen representatives of the cognitive science               community, drawn from colleges, universities, and industry, as well             as by program personnel from NSF and other government agencies.  A              survey of existing cognitive science programs will be conducted                 prior to the workshop.  The workshop will consider ways to bring                more intellectual coherence to the cognitive science major, the                 role of introductory courses in student recruitment, the role of                computational resources in undergraduate programs, the implications             of new developments in cognitive science research for the                       undergraduate curriculum, and the role of various kinds of faculty              and student development programs in the improvement of                          undergraduate cognitive science education.  The final report will               issue recommendations for the future development of cognitive                   science education, and working subgroups of participants will be                formed to pursue some of the recommendations.",
