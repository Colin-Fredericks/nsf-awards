 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to reveal the evolutionary                      relationships among the different groups of salamanders by studying             the information stored in their genetic material (DNA).                         Information contained in the separately inherited nuclear DNA and               mitochondrial DNA is used to provide two independent inferences of              the evolutionary relationships of the different groups of                       salamander.  The evolutionary relationships and historical                      diversification of a group of organisms constitute essential                    knowledge for understanding the group's diversity, value as a                   natural resource and need for conservation.  Nine major groups of               salamanders are currently recognized as taxonomic families                      (Ambystomatidae, Amphiumidae, Cryptobranchidae, Dicamptodontidae,               Hynobiidae, Plethodontidae, Proteidae, Salamandridae and                        Sirenidae); earlier results of this project suggest that the                    Dicamptodontidae as currently recognized incorrectly groups two                 very different evolutionary lineages.  The evolutionary                         relationships of the salamander families to each other and the                  relationships of the major lineages contained within each family                constitute the focus of this work.                                              The experimental procedure consists of purifying DNA from                       specimens, isolating comparable (\"homologous\") segments of DNA,                 obtaining the nucleotide sequence of those DNA segments, and using              statistical tests to discriminate alternative hypothesis of                     salamander evolution.  The patterns of relationship among species               are then used to investigate the processes by which the organismal              diversity observed in each group arose, giving special attention                to developmental patterns.  Evolutionary relationships among the                salamander families are used to investigate the evolution of larval             reproduction, which has occurred multiple times in salamanders.                 Evolutionary relationships within the Plethodontidae and                        Salamandridae address the evolution of the diverse, specialized                 feeding mechanisms that are observed in these families.  All levels             of this analysis contribute to a revised taxonomic classification               of the salamanders.                                                             This work also reveals the evolutionary properties of the nuclear               and mitochondrial DNA sequences studied.  Particular attention is               given to evaluating whether the molecular evolutionary pattern                  meets the assumptions of the analytical methods used to obtain                  evolutionary information from DNA sequence comparisons.  This                   result provides general information regarding the best analytical               methods to use and the magnitude of evolutionary divergence times               over which these molecular comparisons will be informative.  This               facilitates the use of molecular sequence comparisons for                       conducting similar studies on other groups of organisms.",
