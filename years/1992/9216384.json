 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide support for delegates travel to attend                the Third International Conference on Ethics and Development to                 be held in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, on June 21-27, 1992.  Colorado                State University and the International Development Ethics                       Association (IDEA) are the North American sponsors of the                       conference.  The theme is \"The Ethics of Ecodevelopment:                        Culture, the Environment and Dependency.\"   Conference                          participants are expected to number 200, including 50 Hondurans.                IDEA is an interdisciplinary, cross-cultural group of 300                       philosophers, development theorists, and practitioners who apply                ethical reflection to national and international development                    goals and strategies and to the relations between the \"North\" and               the \"South.\"  Among the Conference's distinctive aims are to                    promote a fruitful convergence of international development                     ethics and environmental ethics; to contribute to the formation                 of a new paradigm of sustainable development; and to generate a                 greater understanding of the actual and ideal relationships                     between biodiversity, cultural diversity, and sustainable                       development.  The immediate beneficiaries of these funds will be                participants from the Third World who otherwise would not be able               to attend the conference.  Other participants will benefit from                 their exchange with these speakers about their understanding of                 the problems of and solutions to species impoverishment,                        environmental degradation, and unjust development in both South                 and North.  Besides articles, publications, and proceedings,                    results will include media interviews, newsletter and newspaper                 articles, and further development of the international network of               theorists, analysts, decision makers, academic institutions and                 stakeholder groups concerned about these issues.",
