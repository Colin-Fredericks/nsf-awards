 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this mathematics project is grouped into three main                areas: (a) nonlinear scattering and orbital asymptotic stability                in infinite dimensional Hamiltonian systems, (b) transitions to                 instability and (c) vector Zakharov and nonlinear Schrodinger                   equations.  The first class of problems is concerned with the                   long-time behavior of solutions of nonlinear dispersive systems                 in terms of a nonlinear bound state channel (modeling nondecaying               behavior) and a dispersive radiation field.  The governing                      equations have the structure of a finite dimensional dynamical                  system which is coupled to the infinite dimensional dispersive                  radiation field. In the second, a new theory for a class of                     eigenvalue problems will be applied to nonlinear equations                      modeling long wave propagation in dispersive media.  An advanced                formulation is being developed which is independent of the                      dynamical systems framework.  Applications to nonlocal equations                arising in the study of fluids and plasmas will be sought. The                  third goal is to study the existence and properties of nonlinear                bound states of the vector Zakharov and Schrodinger equations.                  These systems are a better approximation of the physics of waves                in a collisionless plasma.  Associated with these equations are                 believed to be phenomena not present in scalar systems, such as                 non-isotropic ground states, which may participate in the                       dynamics of singularity formation.                                                   Differential equations form the backbone of mathematical                   modeling in the physical sciences.  Phenomena which involve                     continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials and                    energy are known to obey certain general laws which are                         expressible in terms of the interactions and relationships                      between partial derivatives.  The key role of mathematics is not                to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative                  and quantitative meaning from them.",
