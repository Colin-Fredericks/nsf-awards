 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stress can have long-term consequences on the health of                    individuals.  Therefore, it is pertinent to develop strategies                  for adapting and reacting to stress.  Indeed, most mammals have                 evolved behavioral and neuroendocrine mechanisms to cope under                  severe conditions.  The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is                  regarded as a model system illustrating the way the central                     nervous system responds to stress.  Dr. Bronson has identified a                group of mammals, in a natural population in Australia, that do                 not change their behavior but continue to be stressed to the                    point that death is inevitable.  No other mammal incorporates                   life-terminating stress as a normal part of its life history                    strategy.  Therefore, the neuroendocrine linkages between stress                and behavior in these animals must differ sharply from those                    known for other mammals.  Dr. Bronson's initial goal is to                      establish a successful breeding colony of these unique animals in               the United States.  He will then isolate and understand the                     behavioral and neuroendocrine mechanisms that allow this species                to maintain normal, but now destructive behavior, under                         conditions of stress.  The dramatic robustness of the                           relationship between stress and behavior in these animals offers                real hope of dissecting and understanding its neuroendocrine and                neurochemical mechanisms.  Comparing these data with our present                knowledge constitutes a powerful tool for establishing principles               about stress and behavioral that are universally important.                     Working with this unique animal model could prove important for                 exploring the way behavior can modulate the immune system as well               as developing adaptive mechanisms to cope with acute and chronic                stress.",
