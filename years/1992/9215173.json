 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is in                 the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                 subfield of electrosynthesis of materials.  During the tenure of                this three-year continuing grant, Professor Norton and his                      undergraduate research students will investigate chemical and                   structural limitations of superconducting bismuthate materials.                 An electrochemical growth method will be employed to produce                    superconducting crystals with various compositions and the                      structures of these crystals will be mapped using scanning                      tunneling microscopy (STM), x-ray diffraction, and related                      structural probes.  Additionally, these materials will be                       characterized chemically and magnetically.  Optimum crystals will               be selected and utilized in a number of physical studies directed               toward a basic understanding of oxide superconductor behavior.                  %%%                                                                             This project will contribute to an enhanced understanding of the                fundamental structure-property relationships of these                           technologically important materials.  Additionally, the research                experience gained by participating undergraduate students will                  contribute substantively to the development of the infrastructure               of this interdisciplinary area of the chemical sciences.",
