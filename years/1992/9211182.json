 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optional forward contracts for electric power were                              developed by considering the use of financial                                   options for electric power markets.  They play the                              role of interruptible load and dispatchable supply.                             Optional forward contracts may be used in                                       conjunction with, or in place of, \"spot\" or \"real-time\"                         pricing to help create and electric power market in                             which participants are given incentives to make                                 them more responsive to changing system                                         conditions, thus increasing the overall benefit of the                          power system to society.  Their operational role in                             maintaining system security will be investigated,                               including the effect of their use on spinning and                               operating reserve requirements.  How the                                        information revealed by the contract selections of                              market participants can be used in security and                                 system planning will be explored.  The                                          mathematical framework for determining socially                                 optimal levels of system security   will be extended                            to incorporate the use of optional forwards.  The                               basic theory of contract selection by market                                    participants will be generalized and extended.  The                             long-term (planning and investment) incentives and                              effects will be analyzed.  The model of participant                             behavior will be extended to include the effects of                             inflexibility.  The effect of transaction costs and                             imperfect information on contract selection and                                 market efficiency will be investigated.",
