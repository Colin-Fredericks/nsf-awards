Such an intelligent                                                 system must interface between high                                              level specifications and low level                                              actions; between prior information                                              and real-time information which may                                             improve; modify or contradict it;                                               between discrete state or command                                               changes and continuous signals;                                                 between inductive and deductive                                                 learning; between real-time actions                                             and off-line decisions; between                                                 various time scales of environmental                                            response; action and computation;                                               and between models, algorithms, and                                             architectures.                                                                                                                                                  At the highest level, the                                                       intelligent system must be able to                                              select classes of models within                                                 which to describe the environment,                                              change between model classes or                                                 models in response to environmental                                             changes such as failure modes or                                                disruptions, and finally refine the                                             parameters on-line to select a model                                            within a class.                                                                                                                                                 At the operational level, consisting                                            of the core of an intelligent                                                   system, it must deal with the                                                   qualitative aspects of discrete and                                             continuous variables, data or                                                   actions, the temporal aspects of                                                multiple-time scales of                                                         environmental response, measurement                                             or action and the spatial aspects of                                            decentralized or distributed                                                    operation, information or control.                                              In the qualitative realm traversing                                             the purely discrete domain, one has                                             the issues arising from automata                                                theory and supervisory control for                                              reliable or safe operation of                                                   discrete event dynamics.  With the                                              introduction of time, one also has                                              the ability to model performance                                                measures such as cycle-time in                                                  manufacturing systems or throughput                                             in transportation systems.  This                                                leads to several scheduling and                                                 optimization problems.                                                                                                                                          Finally, one has the implementation                                             layer of an intelligent system which                                            involves a unification of software,                                             algorithms whether parallel or                                                  sequential, computer architectures                                              and ultimately their mapping into                                               chips for the end user.  Thus this                                              layer gives rise to several issues                                              such as data structures and                                                     computer-aided-design.                                                                                                                                          While the above suggests a                                                      tripartite dissection of an                                                     intelligent system, our goal is to                                              nevertheless design it to be                                                    transparent to the end user, in a                                               fashion similar to the open systems                                             interconnection architecture.",
