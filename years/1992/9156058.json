 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research during the last two decades has shown that                             conventional physics instruction fails to alter student                         alternative conceptions (misconceptions), to improve their                      problem-solving expertise, and to help students form a coherent                 knowledge structure that can be effectively accessed when                       needed. Recent experiments in physics education show that we                    can do much better.  In these experiments, students are active                  participants in constructing their own knowledge and in                         developing expert-like strategies to solve standard and complex                 problems.                                                                                                                                                       In this project, two new sets of active learning aides are                      being constructed and evaluated, including a set of Concept                     Construction Experiments and a set of Experiment Problems.                      These activities are being used in lecture, recitation, and                     laboratory instruction in large introductory physics classes                    for engineers and science majors.  The kits are being                           integrated with previously developed active learning pencil-                    and-paper activities into a coherent program of physics                         instruction called OCS (Overview, Case Study) Action Physics.                   An Active Learning Student Study Guide and Laboratory Manual                    are being prepared to supplement a conventional textbook. A                     coordinated effort is being made to help students construct                     their own conceptual models, to develop the individual skills                   needed to use those models to solve complex problems, and to                    help students organize this knowledge (conceptual and                           procedural) into a coherent structure that can be accessed                      effectively.  Previous and current work have shown considerable                 promise for this method of instruction.",
