This               program is designed to bridge gaps between quality assurance                    efforts in industry, academia and government through the                        formation of research teams of industrial, academic, and NIST                   statisticians and engineers.  Possible areas of research for                    Fellows ar statistical design of industrial experiments, process                control, studies of advanced manufacturing systems, computing for               engineering and industrial statistics, and calibration of                       manufacturing process control.                                                       Continued funding is provided for a fellowship program,                    designed to have academic statisticians and engineers studying                  industrial problems, especially in the area of quality assurance.",
