 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary aim of previous research has been to describe, using                a constraint based planning strategy, the restructuring of                      architectural design problems.  The present project aims to study               the rationality of designer' behavior in structuring and especially             restructuring design problems.  The research will be performed in               five steps.  First, a model of problem structuring in space                     planning will be developed using optimization.  To overcome                     problems inherent in space planning, such as, continuity of values              and size of problem space, dynamic programming techniques will be               exploited.  Using model developed in the first step, optimal                    solution paths for the given problem structures will be determined.                                                                                             Protocol data of subjects and simulation program called HeGeL, from             previous research, will be used to show factors that explain                    subjects' behavior, whether it be optimal, pareto optimal or non-               optimal.  A new version of HeGeL, HeGeL-II will be developed                    incorporating dynamic programming capabilities developed earlier.               The optimality, Pareto optimality or other forms of \"rationality\"               in the paths and solutions used by subjects will be compared                    against results obtained in the initial modeling step, using HeGeL-             II.  Finally, bounded rationality techniques and strategies for                 space planning which can be integrated into the designers' process              will be proposed.",
