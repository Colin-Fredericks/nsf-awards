 "awd_abstract_narration": "Similar molecular strategies are used in stimulus/response coupling             in all cells.  The process generally involves transmembrane                     receptors located at the cell surface and a set of intracellular                signal transduction proteins that carry information from the                    receptors to the target proteins that mediate the specific                      responses.  Bacterial chemotaxis is an ideal model system for                   investigating the molecular mechanism of receptor-mediated signal               transduction.  The system is composed of a small number of                      components; a family of transmembrane receptor proteins, two                    receptor modifying enzymes, the flagellar motor apparatus, and four             cytoplasmic signal transduction proteins that process information               linking receptor signaling to the motor response.  The central                  signal transduction mechanism in chemotaxis involves                            phosphotransfer from a histidine protein kinase, CheA, to a                     phosphorylation-activated regulator protein that controls the                   direction of flagellar rotation, CheY.  Autophosphorylation of the              kinase, CheA, is regulated by the receptors in a mechanism that                 requires the auxiliary protein, CheW, and is dependent on both the              degree of receptor ligand occupancy, and on the modification state              of the receptor.  The system provides an opportunity for                        elucidating the fundamental principles of protein modification                  reactions and protein/protein interactions in regulatory                        biochemistry.                                                                   %%%                                                                             A molecular description of signal transduction in the model system              of bacterial chemotaxis is critical to understanding the                        fundamental chemical strategies for complex regulatory phenomena                such as signal amplification and adaptation.  Dr. Stock's                       laboratory is using a combination of molecular genetic,                         biochemical, and biophysical methods to correlate structure and                 function of several signal transduction proteins.",
