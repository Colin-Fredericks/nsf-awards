 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career Advancement Award for Women Scientists and Engineers                is intended to support an experienced investigator in activities                that can expand  her research career potential through developing               new research skills and conducting exploratory and pilot work to                determine the feasibility of a contemplated new line of inquiry.                The work is directed at investigating the initiation of particular              democratic institutions, particularly during periods of transition              to democracy.                                                                                                                                                   The study begins with the hypothesis that institutional choice                  depends primarily on the interests of those charged with writing                and voting on new laws and constitutions, and that these interests              center on achieving and surviving in office.  The research                      methodology involves, first, locating the constitutions,                        constitutional amendments, laws, and decrees that initiate                      institutional change; second, attributing institutional preferences             derived from their electoral and other political survival needs to              the actors involved; and third, examining the historical record to              see if the actors identified acted as predicted or not.  Cases to               be examined include nine Latin American countries with substantial              democratic experience during the twentieth century and four East                European countries currently engaged in the transition to                       democracy.                                                                                                                                                      During the period of the award, the investigator will take courses              in math and game theory to upgrade her analytic skills as well as               reading widely on the history and politics of Eastern Europe.  This             Career Advancement Award promises to substantially expand the                   capabilities and potential of the investigator.",
