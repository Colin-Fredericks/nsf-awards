 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed research is to identify the number and              locations of genetic factors underlying differences in adult male               genital morphology in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup.             The approach will involve labeling individual genomic segments of               the mauritiana genome with a P-element construct containing an eye-             color marker.  The study will also be aided by the use of molecular             markers.  We propose a program of hybridization with simulans                   followed by repeated backcrossing to create a large number of                   simulans strains each true-breeding for a separate introgressed                 segment to the mauritiana genome.  These strains will be analyzed               for characters of the male genitalia which differ of these                      characters.  Knowledge of the number of genetic factors that                    underlie genitalic differentiation between closely related species              is crucial to our understanding of this widespread phenomenon,                  especially in the construction of evolutionary models to account                for it.  Additional aspects of the study will address whether the               effects of the introgressed loci show additivity or dominance, and              the degree to which these loci interact epistatically to produce                this divergent morphology.",
