 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will work on several projects.                  The first focusses on extremal problems involving (generalized)                 moment inequalities for sums of independent, symmetric random                   variables with an eye toward obtaining best constants.  The                     research builds on the classic inequalities of Khintchine and                   Rosenthal.  The from of the final inequalities should give some                 insight into the nature of cancellation phenomena and may suggest               extensions to more general dependence relations.  This work is                  ongoing and is joint work with T. Figiel, P. Hitczenko and W. B.                Johnson.  The second project concerns structural problems for U-                statistics and U-processes.  Gine and the principal investigator                have found very little information concerning necessity in the                  context of U-statistics.  Together with J. Cuzik, they have made                some progress on a very special case, but there is much more work               required to understand the general question of cancellation in                  this context.  Two other projects deal with trying to find usable               necessary and sufficient conditions for a class of functions to                 be uniform Donsker (with E. Gine) and studying questions                        concerning convergence rates in the context of bootstrapping                    empirical measures (with F. Gotze).                                                  The principal investigator is working on several projects                  whose primary focus is a better understanding of cancellation                   phenomena for sums of independent random variables.  These types                of problems often arise in statistics.",
