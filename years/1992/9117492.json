 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of Paleontological Society Short Courses                is to provide up-to-date summaries of the \"state of the art\" of                 selected paleontological topics especially for the use and                      dissemination by those teaching paleontological topics at the                   university level.  Additional, these short courses provide timely               summaries for all paleontologists in areas that are peripheral to               their main areas of interest.                                                        Within this overall purpose, this short course will focus on               an, until now, largely overlooked aspects of trace fossils, namely              the biological significance and meaning of traces.  Individuals                 invited to contribute to this short course are well known for their             sedimentological studies of trace fossils hey are also extremely                competent to address the biological components and this has been                clearly conveyed in the invitations and subsequent discussions we               have had with them.  They have all strongly endorsed our approach               and will emphasize what is known about the biological aspects of                their topic (see enclosed course outline).                                           Our approach to the trace fossil short course will diverge                 somewhat from the format used in so many of the past short courses.                                                                                             In addition to the talks and short course notes, we will conduct                a field trip in the Cincinnati area in order to demonstrate methods             of applying trace fossil information to paleoecological                         interpretations of ancient rocks.  In addition, we have arranged                for Mark A. Wilson (College of Wooster, Wooster, Ohio) to conduct               a one-day course in paleobiology of marine hard substrates.",
