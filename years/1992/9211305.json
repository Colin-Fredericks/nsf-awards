 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for three summer                       workshops on field methods research.  The workshop will provide                 training and instruction for 15 advanced sociology graduate                     students or junior faculty each year.  The workshop will focus on               direct field work experience and individualized session with a                  faculty mentor.  The participants will meet three times a week                  for 4 1/2 weeks in two-hour seminar sessions.  The seminars will                be devoted to discussions of epistemological, technical, and                    ethical issues in field work, to the teaching of methods of                     analyzing qualitative data, and to ongoing discussions of the                   participants experiences in their field research.                                    There is a great deal of interest in research using field                  work methods in the sociological research community, but most                   graduate programs provide very little formal training in these                  methods of data collection and in the analyses of qualitative                   data.  This workshop will provide much needed systematic training               and teaching for up to 45 advanced sociology students.  The                     workshop should greatly improve the quality of sociological                     research based on field work methods.",
