 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research includes several interconnected areas of                  activity.  First among them is the continuing developments of a                 general stabilized finite element method for incompressible fluid               flows in the presence of moving boundaries, with particular                     emphasis on free surface and two-phase flows.  The method is                    based on a stabilized space-time formulation, and is capable of                 handling large deformations of the domain.  The velocity-                       pressure-stress formulation will be developed in parallel.  It is               a novel stabilized formulation for incompressible flows which is                applicable to viscoelastic fluids.  This research area will be                  merged into the space-time method development, to allow for                     numerical treatment of viscoelastic fluids in the presence of                   moving boundaries.  Proposed finite element formulations result                 in large linear systems of equations.  These systems will be                    solved implicitly using a GMRES iterative method.  To improve the               rate of convergence, efficient preconditioning techniques will be               designed and test.  Among others, techniques combining the                      Clustered Element-By-Element and Multigrid approaches will be                   examined.  All implementation work will concentrate on massively                parallel architectures.",
