 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacillus thuringiensis is a Gram-positive sporulating bacterium              that produces large amounts of sporulation specific proteins.                   These proteins accumulate as parasporal inclusions and are                      protoxins with selective activity for insect larvae.  Generally,                the inclusion is deposited outside the exosporium and is released               into the environment separately from the spore.  In subspecies                  finitimus, however, the inclusion and the spore share the common                exosporium and are released together.  The exosporium is more                   hydrophobic than the spore (Koshikawa et al., 1989), and exosporium             enclosed inclusions are expected to be more hydrophobic than free               inclusions.  The availability of protoxins to susceptible larvae                may be dependent upon the hydrophobicity of the inclusions.                     Subspecies israelensis produces inclusions composed of protoxins                active on mosquito larvae.  The inclusions of israelensis are                   released separately from the spore and are probably hydrophilic and             not readily available to these larvae in nature. If the inclusions              of israelensis were enclosed within the exosporium, then the                    protoxin should be more accessible and thus a more effective                    biological control agent.  The aims of the preliminary planning                 study are to determine the effects of the exosporium on the                     hydrophobicity of parasporal inclusions, and to determine the                   feasibility of engineering, by genetic techniques, the protoxin of              israelensis inside an exosporium.                                               %%%                                                                             This is a planning study to determine the feasibility of developing             a biological insecticide effective against mosquito larvae.  The                approach is to take advantage of natural antilarval proteins                    produced by a bacterium in the course of sporulation.  Mosquito-                borne diseases of man and other animals represent an extremely                  significant world health and economic problem, particularly in the              third world; one alone, malaria, is the number one cause of                     childhood mortality in the world.  Chemical insecticides are not                only unattractive because of their toxicity to animals and the                  environment, but they are becoming less and less effective as                   insects increasingly develop resistance to them.  This research on              biological pest control is therefore of great significance to both              human health and the environment.",
