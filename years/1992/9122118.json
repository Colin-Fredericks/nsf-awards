 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines equilibrium selection in infinitely repeated             games played by boundedly rational agents.  The decision rules used by          these players will be determined by an evolutionary process in which            successful rules proliferate while unsuccessful rules die.                                                                                                      The project first develops a model of boundedly rational players,               building on recent work using finite automata.  A dynamic evolutionary          process will then be constructed, with particular attention devoted to          the fact that with conventional definitions, evolutionarily stable              strategies do not exist in repeated games.  The research will then              examine the limiting outcomes of this evolutionary process, which will          embody both rules for action and rules for learning from experience             during the game.  Finally, the robustness of the results, especially to         different specifications of environmental \"trembles,\" will be explored.                                                                                         The effectiveness of game theory is limited by the \"folk theorem,\" which        established that in repeated games, virtually anything can be an                equilibrium.  The significance of the proposed research lies in its             potential to yield game-theoretic predictions for repeated games, making        game theory a more powerful analytical tool for a wide class of                 applications.  In particular, the research should shed light on the             evolution of learning rules among boundedly rational agents.",
