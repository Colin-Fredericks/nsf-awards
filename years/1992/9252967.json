 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental methods will be developed to enable the study                of copper speciation at simulated natural water particulate                     interfaces.  A novel experimental model is presented to permit                  analytical determination of interfacial phenomena in situ.  The                 model consists of a stable polymer microemulsion containing                     immobilized reactive ligands on its surface and is intended to                  simulate pertinent features of organic-coated natural water                     particulates.  Interdigitated array electrode electrochemistry                  methodology will be developed to determine Cu(I) generated by                   complex photolysis.  This will result in enhanced interdigitated                array methodology and determination of copper-amino acid                        photolysis rates.  Spectroelectrochemical methods will be                       developed to optically determine complexed copper                               concentrations following electrochemical generation of Cu(II).                        The methods will have general utility to speciation studies at            surfaces and will be applied to the study of copper-amino acid                  complex formation and photolysis.  This advances interfacial                    spectroelectrochemical methodology and knowledge of equilibrium                 speciation of copper-amino acid complexes on surfaces.                                The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                    opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    developing and teaching a new course on Aquatic Chemistry;                      presenting a guest lecture on environmental chemistry; starting a               new curriculum in Environmental Chemistry; and providing                        research guidance and mentoring to students.",
