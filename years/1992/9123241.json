 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Belgrade rat has a microcytic, hypochromic anemia inherited              as an autosomal recessive (gene symbol b), which is due to a                    transferrin cycle defect, resulting in defective intracellular iron             metabolism.  Iron-loaded transferrin enters b/b reticulocytes via               endocytosis, but is released from the cells still bound to iron.                The defect can be partially alleviated when ferric-salicylaldehyde              isonicotinoyl hydrazone delivers iron, bypassing the transferrin                cycle.  When succinylacetone inhibits iron incorporation into heme,             b/b reticulocytes lack the typical buildup of nonheme iron in                   mitochondria, and less iron than usual reaches a putative cytosolic             iron carrier.  These observations suggest that iron is unable to                exit normally from Belgrade endosomes.  This difficulty could be                caused by: (1) poor endosomal acidification; (2) transferrin                    receptors that fail to aid release of iron from transferrin; (3) a              mutant vesicular component that normally transports iron out of the             endosome; or (4) a functional or quantitative decrease in the                   putative cytosolic iron carrier.  Whichever is the case, studies of             the cells of this mutant rat would provide new insight into the                 problem of how cells utilize transferrin iron.  This mutant also                has great value for testing in vivo the validity of recent concepts             in cellular iron metabolism and defining previously unknown or                  poorly understood steps.                                                        %%%                                                                             The Belgrade rat has an inborn error of iron metabolism which is                due to a cellular dysfunction in utilization of iron from                       endocytosed transferrin.  Thus, it is a valuable model system for               studying various aspects of cellular endocytosis as it relates to               transferrin and iron metabolism, both at the cellular and whole-                organism levels.  Belgrade rats are not commercially available, and             in fact the world's supply of breeding stock of these rats is in                jeopardy.  This award is to support the maintenance of a breeding               colony of the mutant rat.",
