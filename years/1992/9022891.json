 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) collects information                  annually from a representative national sample of some 7,000                    families, about 20,000 individuals, and processes it for                        dissemination to a broad segment of the social science community.               A national sample of 2,000 Latino households was added in the                   1990 interviewing year, although the costs of planned ongoing                   annual interviews with this sample are not part of this project.                This grant will extend the PSID for five additional years,                      covering interviewing waves 25 (1992) through 29 (1996).                                                                                                        The additional waves of data will add substantial value to the                  data set's research potential.  The added waves will vastly                     increase the amount and quality of intergenerational data for the               numerous parent-child and sibling pairs in adult ages; facilitate               refinements in business-cycle studies; improve analyses of rare                 life events and long-term effects of life events by providing                   more than a quarter century of life-cycle information on workers                and families; expand the issues that spells analysis can address;               make possible international comparisons with similar income-                    dynamics panel studies that have been launched in a number of                   European countries; ensure that social scientists will continue                 to be able to monitor the effects of changing economic and social               conditions and policies; and enhance the research potential of                  recent additions to the study by extending their measurement                    period.                                                                                                                                                         Five more years of data will also permit the PSID to become a                   data resource for research on economics and global change.                      Information will be gathered that will permit better estimates of               the likely behavioral adjustments to the changing conditions                    occasioned by global environmental change.  The behaviors of                    interest include geographic mobility, energy consumption and                    inter-sector labor mobility.  The new data linked to data                       collected in the past will also permit better analysis of the                   likely distribution consequences of global changes -- who wins                  and loses -- in terms of income, employment and health.",
