Three                series of studies are presented: Series I focuses on the meaning of             minority, the influence of task subjectivity/objectivity, and the               need for closure; Series 2 with the controversy surrounding                     minority influence effects on perceptual judgments; Series 3 with               an extension of the initial results into the realm of persuasion,               with special emphasis on source, message, and sleeper effects and               the impact of cognitive load on influenceability.  The research                 makes use of findings which suggest that people are differentially              susceptible to in-group or out-group influence as a consequence of              the objectivity/subjectivity of judgments.  The project has the                 potential to clarify important issues in minority/majority                      influence, and to integrate past findings by highlighting the                   relevance of cognate theories (social comparison, social                        identification), whose utilization will create a more comprehensive             and general model of social influence.",
