 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's             (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is               designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly             the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                 Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.               Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                   conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private                     venture capital or other non-federal financing.                                      This Phase I project addresses multipath fading on radio                   channels for high speed digital communications.  The principal                  investigator is investigating a new approach that adapts the system             data rate to the time-varying signal-to-noise ratio at the radio                receiver.  The objectives are to determine the feasibility of rate              changing algorithms and adaptive synchronization; develop a measure             of waiting time performance; and determine the effects of queueing,             a noisy feedback channel, rate changing overhead, and propagation               delay.  The approach employs trellis coded modulation in an                     adaptive scheme where the data rate varies by changing the                      number of bits per channel symbol.",
