 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design and manufacture of aircraft engines are complex.                In this project, the concurrent engineering methodology will be                 used as a team-building tool for the design and manufacture of                  some aircraft engine parts by precision investment casting.  The                concepts of design and manufacturing are integrated as a total                  system involving the concurrent (simultaneous) application of                   such state-of-the-art techniques as computer integrated                         manufacturing (CIM); total quality control (TQC) using Taguchi                  methods and quality function deployment (QDF); and just-in-time                 (JIT) production techniques.                                                         The design/manufacturing total system concept shows that                   cost and quality do not lie at the opposite spectrum of the                     production enterprise.  The design and manufacturing operation of               aircraft engines, though complex, could be performed at high-                   quality and at low-cost using the total system concept derived                  from concurrent engineering as a team-building tool.  In this                   research project, some major components of an aircraft engine are               to be manufactured through the application of the                               design/manufacturing total system methodology by precision                      investment casting.",
