The Indian                   scientists will participate on Fermilab Experiments 782 and 802.                In E782, a study of muon interactions in a bubble chamber, two                  scientists from India, Drs. Chatterjee and Gosh will participate                with several U.S. and foreign institutions.  In E802, a study of                muon interactions in emulsion, the Jadavpur team has been                       approved by Fermilab as the sole investigator.  The visits by the               Indian scientists to Fermilab will cover three phases: planning                 the emulsion exposure, exposing the stack, and establishing                     bubble chamber scanning criteria and efficiencies to assure                     consistency of film scanning in Calcutta.                                                                                                                       Scope:  This project represents a strong collaborative effort in                experiments that require efforts and inputs from scientists from                several countries utilizing major U.S. facilities and unique                    experimental opportunities.  The collaboration will be beneficial               to both the U.S. and the Indian scientists.",
