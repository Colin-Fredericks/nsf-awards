 "awd_abstract_narration": "Naturally-occurring radionuclides of cosmogenic origin and of the               U-Th decay series, as well as man-made nuclides produced by                     atmospheric weapon testing and nuclear reactors, have proven to                 be valuable tracers for geochronology and geochemical studies.                  At the University of Southern California, the application of                    these isotopes is being actively studied for solving                            oceanographic, geologic and environmental problems.  In many                    cases, the research has been carried out in collaboration with                  scientists at several other institutions.  The measurements rely                heavily on two work-horse instruments:  y-ray and &-ray                         spectrometers.  Whereas the &-spectrometer has 16 detectors to                  serve the basic need in the alpha-counting area, there is only                  one detector for y-ray spectrometric work.  The y-ray detector,                 seven years old, has shown signs of wear-and-tear as a result of                heavy use.  The present gamma counting system not only is heavily               taxed beyond its capacity, but also limits the ability to make                  measurements in the field and on short-lived isotopes.  This                    action provides funds to purchase an additional y-ray                           spectrometer, equipped with a high efficiency, high resolution                  well-type intrinsic germanium detector, to alleviate this                       problem.  The acquisition will also enable a substantial                        reduction of man-power in future analyses to be realized and                    benefit programs both at USC and at the institutions of our                     collaborators.",
