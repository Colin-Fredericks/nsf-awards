 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science                             Program supports collaborative research in theoretical                          physics to be conducted, in the U.S. by Dr. Michael W.                          Guidry of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and Dr.                        John O. Rasmussen of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory                           and, in Brazil by Drs. Raul Donangelo and Filipe Canto                          of the Federal University, Rio de Janeiro and Dr. Mahir                         Hussein of the University of Sao Paulo.  The focus of                           the research will be to use semiclassical methods to                            gain a theoretical description of heavy-ion collisions                          when one of the collision partners is deformed.  The                            work could lead to a practical and reliable tool to                             interpret present and future heavy-ion experiments.                                                                                                             The project will extend previous calculations to a more                         comprehensive treatment of heavy-ion transfer reactions                         including the treatment of two- and one-particle                                transfer reactions, and will incorporate new ideas in                           nuclear structure such as the Fermion Dynamical Symmetry                        Model.  The formalism will permit study of a substantial                        body of high-spin transfer data for which there are                             presently few theoretical calculations, and should prove                        valuable for understanding transfer data that will                              become available with GAMMASPHERE and EUROBALL.  The                            project brings together a group of internationally known                        physicists who have collaborated well in the past.",
