 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Introductory Physics Laboratory Course at Rutgers-Newark is                  being developed using micro computer based instrumentation to                   improve the understanding and appreciation of the laws of                       physics and of the instrumentation and methods of modern                        physics and technology.  The makeup of the Rutgers-Newark                       student body and the geography and demographics of the Newark                   area, coupled with significant outreach efforts, ensures a                      large minority student participation in this project.  Teaching                 and teaming strategies geared to the needs of this diverse                      urban student population are being developed. Said strategies                   utilize non-intimidating but rigorous discovery based                           experiments and provide a meaningful and accurate introduction                  to the excitement and creativity of scientific discovery and                    analysis.  The course uses modern sensors for motion, force,                    temperature, sound and electromagnetic field measurements.  The                 sensors are being interfaced to Macintosh microcomputers                        allowing the students to analyze their measurements rapidly and                 to explore alternative physical hypotheses. The project attract                 more students into physics and engineering, and produces better                 educated students with critical analytical skills in all                        majors.  The program is being adapted, for and shared with high                 school teachers and their students as well as two-year college                  faculty and students.",
