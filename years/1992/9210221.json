 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cytokinins are thought to play a central role in controlling plant              growth and development.  They are essential for cell division and               organogenesis in tissue culture, they can influence chloroplast                 development, delay senescence in detached tissues, and cause                    outgrowth of lateral buds.  Despite these impressive effects,                   little is known about how cytokinins act.                                                                                                                       The long-term research goal is to understand how the cytokinin                  signal is perceived and transduced in the plant.  Two approaches                will be used: (1) Arabidopsis thaliana cytokinin-insensitive                    mutants will be identified.  Because many interesting mutations                 might be lethal, screening will be conducted so that lethal                     recessive mutations can be retrieved as heterozygotes.  Obtaining               such mutants will enable future cloning of a gene involved in the               cytokinin-response pathway. (2) Regulation of gene expression by                cytokinins will be analyzed.  One of the most dramatic and                      accessible effects of cytokinins is their ability to overcome                   apical dominance and cause outgrowth of lateral buds.  Genes whose              expression is induced within 6 hours of cytokinin treatment of                  tomato lateral buds will be cloned.  Whether cytokinins control                 gene transcription or post-transcriptional processes will be                    determined.  These experiments will produce the tools necessary for             identifying cellular factors that control gene expression in                    response to cytokinins.",
