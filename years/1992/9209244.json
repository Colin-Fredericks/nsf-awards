 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuropeptides are signals that are released by nerve cells to                   transmit information to other nerve cells and to other cells in the             body, like muscle, glands and skin.  Very often within a single                 neuron, neuropeptides are released along with specific                          neurotransmitters and modulate their subsequent action.  Indeed,                the nervous system is designed to received and transmit information             and neuropeptides are central to those basic processes.  While it               is estimated that 100's of neuropeptides are made by nerve cells,               only 1% of all nerve cells express a given neuropeptide gene.  Dr.              Taghert will use an innovative molecular genetic approach to                    examine the fundamental mechanisms underlying the expression and                release of neuropeptides.  He will create and recover                           loss-of-function mutations in a specific gene for a precursor                   protein that encodes 13 related neuropeptides.  By studying                     individuals that are chronically deficient in the production of                 these molecules, Dr. Taghert will determine  function and whether               other neuropeptides share overlapping roles.  In addition, he has               developed methodology to put genes back and thus, will assess the               specific capacity of subsets of encoded neuropeptides to restore                lost functions.  These experiments will lead to a better                        understanding of the roles played by the neuropeptide gene in                   individual neurons.  Since Drosophila is used as the model system,              demonstrating the lethal nature of mutations in the neuropeptide                encoding gene may help stimulate research into insecticides that                act by inhibiting neuropeptide synthesis or neuropeptide stimulated             neurotransmission.",
