 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                  will help the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation acquire an                 Elemental Analyzer.  This instrument will provide fundamental                   analytical support for researchers in the Department of Chemistry               including synthetic, bioorganic and analytical chemists involved                in research projects that include: synthesis of complex natural                 products, design and synthesis of complex organic and                           organometallic compounds, catalytic antibodies, design and                      synthesis of enzyme inhibitors, synthesis of peptides,                          oligonucleotides and their analogs, isolation of enzymes,                       modification of natural enzymes, synthesis of artifical enzymes,                and the development of new synthetic technology.  Departments at                Scripps (Immunology, Molecular and Experimental Medicine,                       Molecular Biology and Neuropharmacology) and outside of Scripps                 will also have access to this facility through an already                       established mass spectrometry user facility.                                    %%%                                                                             Elemental analysis combined with mass spectrometry, nuclear                     magnetic resonance and x-ray crystallography can provide                        sufficient information to allow for the unequivocal determination               of molecular structure.  The distinctive characteristics of this                technology include its ability to provide unambiguous                           compositional data consistently and quickly for virtually all of                the numerous classes of organic materials, independent of the                   physical characteristics of a sample (i.e., crystal size and the                stability of the molecular ion).  In addition, elemental analysis               is the only method that can evaluate sample purity.  The unique                 and fundamental information provided by elemental analysis                      facilitates research in the chemical and biological sciences.                   This is particularly true in structural, synthetic and bioorganic               chemistry.",
