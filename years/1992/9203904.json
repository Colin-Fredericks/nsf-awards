 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports mathematical research concerned with                   nonlinear differential equations which are nonelliptic.  The                    goals are to establish regularity results about solutions                       belonging to classes of functions in various spaces called                      Sobolev spaces.                                                                      The differential operators under consideration are inverted                through integral formulas of the Fourier-Airy type. These have an               oscillatory kernel and are under intensive investigation at this                time. Currently it is possible to obtain the mapping properties                 of the integral operators within a small loss of derivative; work               is being done to show that one need not assume this extra loss.                 Other emphasis will be placed on establishing the p-th power                    regularity of solutions of the wave equation on the complement of               strictly convex obstacles.  Some good results have been obtained                from a model case, by considering the problem with boundary a                   fixed distance from the obstacle and then letting the distance                  decrease.  If this technique can be validated in the general case               it will not only provide an existence proof of regularity but                   also provide a convergence method for approximating boundary                    data.                                                                                Additional work is being carried out on the oblique                        derivative problem, where boundary data is given in terms of                    'flux' passing through the boundary at oblique and even                         tangential directions.  Two methods of solutions are known, each                depending on additional assumptions.  Efforts will be made to                   make sharp comparisons between them.",
