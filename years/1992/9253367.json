 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science-By-Mail is a mentorship program between scientists and                  youth whereby youth have a subscription for three scientific                    challenge packets each year, create solutions, and receive                      responses from a personal scientist.  Science-By-Mail brings the                excitement of science discovery into classrooms and homes of                    children around the country and provides them with positive,                    approachable role models of professional scientists.                                                                                                            A grant of $622,088 over three years will allow us to strengthen                and expand this program nationally, focusing especially on                      increasing participation by minority youth and scientists.                      Specifically, support is requested for the design and                           development of 12 new challenge packets; to increase                            participation to 47,900 youth, 4,500 scientists, and 26 regional                chapters; promote increased corporate and other private-sector                  involvement in the program; and to conduct an annual evaluation.                The AAAS will aid in the recruitment of volunteer scientists.                   In addition, we will work together with the National 4-H Council                to pilot the program within that organization (with a membership                of 5.4 million), focusing particularly on minority youth.                       Anticipated income form the expansion of Science-By-Mail will                   make the program self-sufficient at the end of the grant period.//",
