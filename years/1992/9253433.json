 "awd_abstract_narration": "In partnership with the Dayton Board of Education and the business              community, Wright State University is building a pilot multi-faceted            model program for maximizing the number of highly motivated and                 academically competent women students at Dunbar Magnet High School so           that they go on to earn baccalaureate (and higher) degrees in the               natural sciences.  Women constitute 52 percent of the student body at           Dunbar, and most are minority (95 percent).  The specific goals are:            to enhance pre-college science and mathematics courses; to strengthen           the teaching skills of high school science teachers by updating their           knowledge of modern research tools and techniques; to make science              education more active and participatory; to make science relevant; to           provide minority and women high school students an orientation to               career needs, requirements and opportunities in the natural sciences;           to establish year-round links between science teachers, faculty, and            the private sector research scientists; to develop a mentor program             through which faculty can nurture, encourage, motivate, inspire and             challenge women and minority high school students to pursue scientific          careers; to form a network of partners with the private sector and seek         their involvement in the Dunbar project; and to sensitize the faculty           to the educational needs and \"culture\" of women and minorities.  Since          most public high schools in large cities have demographics similar to           Dayton's, this pilot model program may be replicated almost unchanged.          Thus, its impact is expected to be significant nationally.",
