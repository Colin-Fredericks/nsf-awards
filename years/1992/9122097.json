 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the development and functional organization of the                nervous system has emerged as one of the fundamental issues in                  modern biomedical science.  The olfactory system which subserves                the sense of smell is as an excellent model for studying these                  issues and others which are unique to this sensory system.                                                                                                      How the olfactory system functions; how is assembled during                     development; how it is maintained throughout the life of the                    organism; and how it contributes to survival through its effect                 on an organism's behavior are major objectives. In particular,                  the three central problems of olfaction are the molecular and                   cellular mechanisms of how we are able to detect and discriminate               such a vast number of different odorants, how this information is               encoded so that it is able to be interpreted by the brain, and                  how genes determine the assembly and maintenance of the olfactory               system.  These studies involve isolating and characterizing genes               that are important in the functioning of the olfactory system                   using the experimentally manipulable animal model, the fruit fly,               Drosophila melanogaster. One of the genes, called pentagon, when                disrupted leads to a specific defect in the animal's ability to                 respond to the odorant benzaldehyde (oil of almond), while                      preserving the response to a number of other odorants.  The                     specificity of this defect suggests that the pentagon gene is                   responsible for making a molecule that may be essential in the                  initial reception of processing of odorants.  By employing a                    multidisciplinary approach which includes behavioral studies, in                conjunction with molecular and genetic studies, the pentagon                    molecule, is isolated and its role in the functioning of the                    olfactory system is determined.  This should provide important                  insights into how the sense of smell works and help to explain                  one of the major paradoxes of the sense of smell which is: Why do               some odorants the appear to be virtually identical, chemically,                 smell completely different, while odorants with little in common                chemically may smell the same.",
