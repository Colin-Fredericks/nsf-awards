 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the \"distributional histories\" of                 larval cod on Georges Bank during the spring and early summer                   period of developing thermal stratification. The period of thermal              stratification is a time during which the intricacies of larval cod             vertical and areal distributions may hold important implications                for survival and ultimately recruitment. This project will utilize              a new technique of otolith analyses (Sr/Ca ratios), which has                   recently been developed, to hindcast the temperature histories,                 and hence distributional histories (that is from the time of                    hatching to capture), of individual cod larvae collected in various             hydrographic regimes in the Georges Bank area.  The technique will              be advanced by employing a new technology, electron energy loss                 spectroscopy, which will increase the resolution of the Sr/Ca                   technique to a level capable of resolving sub-daily temperature                 histories.  These analyses could reveal diel vertical migrations                into or through a thermocline.                                                                                                                                  Larval cod are believed to be more closely associated with the                  stratified waters on the sides of Georges Bank than the tidally                 mixed waters on top of the Bank, and are transported around Georges             Bank and to the southwest with the residual circulation.  The                   abundances of their zooplankton prey are also more abundant on the              stratified side of the thermal front in early spring, and the                   larvae are often associated with the depth of maximum prey                      abundance in the thermocline.  Later in the year the late larvae                and early juveniles are on the top of the Bank, where zooplankton               densities become greater than on the flanks.  The exact nature of               the vertical and areal distributions of the larvae in relation to               mixed and stratified waters may be very important with regard to                horizontal transport processes, temperature effects on growth, and              the availability of zooplankton prey items.  This project will                  employ new technology to examine the distributions of cod larvae                and will form a collaborative link with an already-funded study                 (NOAA) that  focuses on the physics of the vernal stratification                process as it relates to the complete suite of zooplankton, and the             distribution, growth and condition of cod and haddock larvae, thus              making for a strong interdisciplinary program",
