This conference is                     primarily concerned with the biology and molecular biology of                   genetic exchange systems in a variety of procaryotic and eukaryotic             systems, and is the major annually occurring meeting devoted to                 this subject area internationally.  One significant feature of                  these meetings is their accessibility to graduate students and                  post-doctoral students, whose travel funds frequently are limited.              Specifically to address this problem, we request funds to provide               travel support scholarships to facilitate the attendance of                     graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various                 areas of genetic exchange and related subject areas.                            %%%                                                                             This consistently excellent meeting is the major forum for                      discussion of transfer of genetic information between  organisms.",
