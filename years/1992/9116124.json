 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this US-Hungary cooperative                            research project between Dr. Gyorgy Racz of the Technical                       University, Budapest and Dr. Darash Wasan of Illinois                           Institute of Technology is to investigate foaminess and                         antifoaming processes in foam systems.  Results will                            contribute to our understanding of the foam generation and                      antifoaming mechanisms by taking into account effects of                        dynamic interfacial properties.  Researchers will use a                         mixer-type foam generator and specially designed glass                          cells for microvisual observations and techniques of                            common and differential microinterferometry to observe                          film drainage and the effects of antifoaming agents.  Data                      obtained will be correlated and serve as a basic data bank                      in determining foaminess and antifoaming processes.  Funds                      for the project are awarded through the US-Hungary Joint                        Fund, Budapest, in accordance with established guidelines.",
