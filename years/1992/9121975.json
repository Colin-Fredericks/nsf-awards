The same equipment is being purchased at three other                            institutions in a shared research effort.  Research topics                      include gaze control and target tracking, stereo and motion                     analysis, landmark-based navigation, automatic acquisition of                   object and environmental models, hand-eye coordination,                         dextrous manipulation with multi-fingered hands, real-time                      perception and manipulation.  System software, algorithms and                   subsystems will be shared across the institutions.                                                                                                              The University of Rochester will be purchasing equipment to                     support a multi-institutional shared research effort in                         active vision for robot navigation and manipulation.  Other                     members of the consortium are the University of Pennsylvania,                   University of Maryland and the University of Massachusetts.                     Each institution will acquire the same state-of-the-art                         binocular camera head of high precision and high speed, and                     will share in the development of systems software and                           application software.",
