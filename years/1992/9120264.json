 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chromosomes are the organelles that express, replicate and                      faithfully transfer the genetic material.  We are interested in the             mechanism of meiotic chromosome function in the model recombination             and then segregate from each other.  Meiotic recombination is                   required for the proper segregation of homologues.  However, the                mechanisms that control and insure that all chromosomes undergo                 meiotic recombination are not understood.  Chromosome I is the                  smallest S. cerevisiae chromosome and has a significantly higher                rate of meiotic recombination than larger S. cerevisiae                         chromosomes.  The high rate of recombination is necessary to insure             that chromosome I homologues always recombine with each other.  We              will examine the mechanisms that control recombination on this well             characterized chromosome.  We propose that there is a global                    control that affects the entire chromosome and may be mediated by               crossover interference.  Evidence for global control comes from                 studies that show recombination rates are directly affected by                  chromosome size.  We will characterize this control by studying the             effects of moving large regions of chromosome I to larger and                   smaller chromosomal DNA molecules.  We will quantitate the extent               of the control and determine whether specific chromosomal sequences             are involved.  To better understand the mechanism of crossover                  interference, we will determine the amount of DNA affected by it                and isolate mutants that are defective in this control. Finally we              will construct a minimal size meiotically functional chromosome                 fragment that undergoes meiotic recombination at the maximum                    possible rate.  This minichromosome will serve as a model for                   physical studies on meiotic recombination.  The information we                  obtain in these studies will enable us to better understand how                 recombination is controlled so that chromosomes pair and segregate              properly during meiosis.",
