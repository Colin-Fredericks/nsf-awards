 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose is to develop a language and methodology for                   specifying the requirements and design of concurrent distributed                real-time systems, including the monitored and controlled                       physical environment.  A new, complete, and executable notation,                called communicating real-time state machines (CRSM), is                        proposed as a basis.  They are essentially state machines that                  communicate synchronously over one-directional channels; in                     addition, CRSM has a novel and small set of facilities for                      describing timing properties and for accessing real time.                            The research consists of five related parts.  The first is                 to define further and implement the basic CRSM model.  Another                  is to develop a structuring scheme that permits the composition                 of machines and their parts into higher level entities.  A third                is to design a methodology that combines the state-based CRSM                   approach with an object-oriented model.  A fourth part of the                   research is to develop formal reasoning methods and tools, for                  proving and testing assertions about specifications.  Lastly,                   specification experiments will be performed on some substantial                 applications.",
