 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study genetic factors that affect sperm                  function in fertilization. Previous work by the P.I. has identified             a factor near the centromere of mouse chromosome 6 which plays a                role in sperm maturation and function; this area was identified                 using Robertsonian translocations involving the Rb (6.16) junction.             The current work will involve analysis of regions surrounding this              junction to identify sequences involved in delay in sperm                       viability. DNA clones from the Rb (6.16) junction and the                       centromeres/telomeres of the normal 6 and 16 chromosomes will be                prepared after microdissection. The clones will be characterized                and unique sequences will be localized and amplified. Genetic                   mapping of unique sequences will be done using recombinant inbred               strains and interspecies backcross. The presence or absence of                  telomeric repeats in the Rb junction will be determined, to try to              understand the origin of Rb translocations. Information about the               mechanism of centric fusions will also be obtained.                             %%%                                                                             This proposal is to study genetic factors in sperm that are                     involved in fertilization. Chromosomes or chromosomal regions that              play a role in mammalian sperm function are being identified, prior             to identifying genes that influence sperm maturation and function.              chromosomally different sperm in a predictable manner. Using mice               bred to carry certain chromosomal translocations, a factor(s) near              the centromere region of chromosome 6 has been identified which                 affects sperm maturation and function. This area, known as an Rb                (6.16) junction, and the centromeres/telomeres of chromosomes 6 and             16, will be microdissected and cloned. Clones will be characterized             and unique sequences will be amplified; genetic mapping of unique               sequences will be done. The presence or absence of telomeric                    repeats in the Rb (6.16) junction will be assessed, to determine                what is involved in the origin of Rb translocations. This will be               the first molecular analysis of the junction of an Rb transloca-                tion. This may help in the understanding of centric fusion and its              role in sperm function.",
