 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. C. Vance Haynes and collaborators will examine geological                   sections in 16 U.S. archaeological sites which bracket the                      Pleistocene-Holocene transition which occurred from ca. 11,500 to               10,500 years ago.  During three seasons of fieldwork they will                  conduct geologic mapping and microstratigraphic recording in                    sufficient detail to understand the processes and origins, and to               provide a precise stratigraphic framework for sampled sediments,                fauna, pollen, diatoms, artifacts and radiocarbon samples.                      Pollen and diatom analyses will be conducted by appropriate                     specialists and a large number of samples will be dated to a                    precision of +- 80 years by radiocarbon accelerator mass                        spectrometry.  This research will provide increased insight into                the climatic and environmental changes which marked the end of                  the last Ice Age and the response of humans as well as other                    species.                                                                                                                                                        Archaeological evidence clearly indicates that humans were                      present in North America prior to the end of the last Ice Age.                  These groups, known as \"Folsom\", which is the name of a                         specialized stone point type they employed, were widely                         distributed and hunted species such as mastodon.  However, within               what appears to be an extremely limited interval a transition                   occurs and \"Clovis\" peoples first appear in the archaeological                  record.  At about the same time, several other changes seem to                  take place as well.  Preliminary evidence indicates climatic                    drying and the rapid extinction of many species.  While a number                of archeological sites exist which span this interval, it is                    difficult to compare across them because of varying analytic                    techniques employed.  The work by Dr. Haynes and his colleagues                 will provide the basis for synthesizing large amounts of data                   from these individual sites.  It will also allow him to test his                hypothesis that a rapid and marked reduction in rainfall was                    responsible for associated environmental and cultural changes.                                                                                                  This research is important because it will shed light on a poorly               understood aspect of U.S. prehistory.  It will also increase our                understand of climate change and human and other animal response                to it.",
