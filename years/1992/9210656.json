 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth and reproduction of insects is controlled by hormones                released from the endocrine glands.  These glands are, in turn,                 controlled by specific neuropeptides produced in small groups of                cells in the brain.  Molecular genetics and DNA cloning methods                 will be used to investigate the control of production and the                   functions of one of these neuropeptides, named PTTH                             (prothoracicotropic hormones).  The studies will be carried out                 using the fruitfly Drosophila, which is the organism of choice for              molecular genetic studies.  The idea that PTTH controls the                     production of molting hormone will be tested by determining the                 levels of PTTH and molting hormone at different developmental                   stages and in insects affected by mutations that perturb growth.                The PTTH gene will be cloned, and synthetic PTTH derived from the               cloned gene will be used in experiments to investigate how PTTH                 controls its target organ, the prothoracic gland, Genetic                       techniques will be used to disrupt the PTTH gene in order to                    identify all of the processes that it controls.  The results of                 these studies promise to extend our understanding of the hormonal               control of insect growth and lead to novel strategies for designing             new insect control agents.  In addition, they will provide a new                way of investigating the basic neurohormonal mechanisms underlying              control of reproduction in other organisms including man.",
