 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, there has been a                                                      revolution in the field of ultrafast                                            lasers.  New broadband solid-state                                              laser materials such as titanium-                                               doped sapphire make it possible to                                              produce pulses of unprecedented                                                 short duration and high average                                                 power, using very simple lasers.                                                Also, the recently-developed                                                    technique of chirped-pulse                                                      amplification makes it possible to                                              generate peak powers of greater than                                            a terawatt using a small-scale laser                                            system.  These high-power pulses, in                                            combination with various nonlinear-                                             optical techniques, make it possible                                            for the first time to generate                                                  ultrashort pulses at ultraviolet and                                            vacuum-ultraviolet wavelengths.  My                                             plan is to study these techniques of                                            generating short-wavelength light,                                              and then to use short-wavelength                                                pulses of 1-100 fs duration to study                                            dynamic processes in material and                                               chemical systems.  Since the highly-                                            excited states in atoms, molecules,                                             and solids that are accessible with                                             short-wavelength light typically                                                have very short lifetimes, a source                                             with short wavelength and short time                                            duration will be particularly useful                                            as a research tool.  Processes of                                               interest to me include carrier                                                  dynamics in high-bandgap materials                                              and dielectric breakdown dynamics;                                              molecular dynamics and molecular                                                control of organic molecules (which                                             typically absorb light most strongly                                            in the deep-UV); and surface                                                    dynamics using ultraviolet                                                      photoemission.",
