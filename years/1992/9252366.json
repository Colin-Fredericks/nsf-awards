 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to develop a Process Instrumentation and                        Control laboratory which will complement an undergraduate                       control course, with the same title, which is the main course                   in the Controls Option at this Institution.  The project is                     focused on practical process control loop design and                            implementation using modern instrumentation.  The goal is that                  after completing the course with the laboratory, the students                   will have learned practical as well as theoretical aspects of                   process control.  To this end, a network of six PCs equipped                    with data acquisition cards will be purchased for both software                 analysis and design and for controlling dynamic systems using                   digital computers.  Typical transducers will be introduced and                  specific processes and systems will be controlled using                         commercially available instrumentation, actuators and                           controllers.  The project will also enable the introduction to                  the students of programmable logic controllers, as used                         extensively in industry today.",
