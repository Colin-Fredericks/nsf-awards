 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to research and develop flexible forming of                  sheet metal with the aid of a programmable die, in conjunction with             closed loop control of the forming process.  In concept this                    implies a sheet metal forming process driven only by the geometric              data, as defined by a Computer Aided Design (CAD) system, that can              also adapt to part shape changes and material and forming condition             uncertainties.  This work will focus on two major issues.  They are             (1) fundamental exploration of discrete tool forming mechanics and              a concomitant machine design to identify and achieve maximum                    forming fidelity, process accuracy and speed, and (2) refinement                of the deformation transfer function concept for general                        three-dimensional complex sheet metal parts using numerical                     simulation and experiments.                                                          The final outcome of this research is the elimination of long              set-up and tooling developing times currently associated with the               sheet metal forming process.  This will not only reduce time and                costs associated with this process but also allow the economical                processing of small lot production of complex sheet metal parts.                The sheet metal forming process is a major component in the                     manufacturing of many durable goods and the results of this                     research will enhance the efficiency of that sector of industry.",
