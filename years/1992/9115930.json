The purpose of                            the proposed research is to explore how students'                               intuitive calculus concepts as well as knowledge of                             their conceptual difficulties could help in                                     developing an enhanced approach to the teaching of                              calculus.                                                                                                                                                       Calculus concepts are essential for understanding                               both the physical sciences and many events in daily                             life.  Preliminary results indicate that calculus                               experts may retain intuitive conceptions of calculus                            operations not identical with those of the formal                               calculus in which they are trained.  Researchers at                             CINVESTAV have found historically early conceptions                             of calculus shared many commonalities with                                      approaches of novice students to calculus-based                                 problems.  By teaming up to explore both novice and                             expert conceptions of calculus, the collaborators                               hope to better understand how calculus is                                       conceptualized and learned in order to develop a new                            model of calculus instruction that recognizes and                               seeks to develop students' alternative intuitive                                conceptions.  The proposed cross-national                                       collaboration will provide an efficient coordination                            of research resources aimed at supporting a new                                 approach to calculus education.",
