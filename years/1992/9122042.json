 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last decade the fields of laboratory safety,                           occupational health, and chemical waste handling have undergone                 substantial evolution. During the same time period, there have                  been significant new regulatory developments, laboratory                        standards and additional environmental restrictions on chemical                 waste handling and atmospheric emissions. In response to these                  changes the National Research Council will organize a committee,                composed of experienced scientists from academia, industry, and                 government to prepare an updated report that is responsive to                   current knowledge and regulations. This report will encompass the               subject content of two original reports, \"Prudent Practices for                 Handling Hazardous Chemicals\" and \"Prudent Practices for Disposal               of Chemicals from Laboratories\" and will expand to include new                  topics not covered in the earlier reports. The report will be                   valuable for all laboratory personnel who handle hazardous                      chemicals in laboratories and provide leadership for laboratory                 safety for the 1990s.",
