 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent analyses of the luteovirus and related PEMV group have                   identified a capsid subunit implicated as the determinant of                    circulative aphid transmission.  It is hypothesized that the                    recognition between virus and vector is mediated by specific                    receptors occurring in the aphids' salivary system.  THe objectives             of this study are twofold.  First, it is proposed to apply sequence             analysis of transmissible and nontransmissible strains of PEMV to               examine the mechanism of expression and suppression of this                     phenotype.  Second, the specificity of the virus-vector interaction             will be exploited to produce specific probes for application in EM              in situ localization studies to identify the site(S) within the                 vector leading to this recognition.                                                                                                                             This research concerns the molecular basis of aphid transmission                of a group of economically important plant viruses known as the pea             enation mosaic viruses.  This study will provide information on the             viral protein domains involved in aphid transmission of the virus,              and the genetic mechanisms that lead to the expression of specific              viral phenotypes.  In addition, it will provide information on the              pathway of virion transport, as well as on the presence and                     location of viral receptors in the aphid vector.  Since there is                currently no known plant resistance mechanisms for these viral                  groups, understanding this transmission process may suggest methods             for both vector and virus control.",
