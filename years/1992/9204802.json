 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the morphogenesis of the larval                  head of Drosophila. Mechanisms for the establishment of the                     pattern of head segmentation at blastoderm stage and early                      embryonic development of the head will be investigated,                         specifically with regard to the action of the CNC gene of                       Drosophila, which is expressed in three head segments. This work                will characterize the genetic controls activating CNC expression                in the proper segments, analyze the effects of loss of and of                   ubiquitous over expression of CNC function on embryonic                         development and investigate the possible DNA-binding activity of                the CNC protein. This work will also characterize a set of                      mutants that affect the principal process of head morphogenesis,                head involution, which occurs after the initial pattern is                      established, by using the expression of CNC and Dfd to follow                   specific segments in the abnormal morphogenetic movements of                    these mutants. This research will provide additional insight into               how genes interact during pattern formation in development and                  what role they play in the control of the morphogenetic movements               that manifest that initial pattern.",
