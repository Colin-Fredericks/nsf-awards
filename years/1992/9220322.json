 "awd_abstract_narration": "At present, blind people have limited access to scientific                      literature and few means beyond \"working it out in one's head\"                  to do math.  New raised-print technology permits printing                       scientific equations, figures, and diagrams that can be read                    tactilely.  Development and testing of an equation-printing                     method that retains the intuitive and conceptual advantages of                  the standard spatial representation of math equation is under                   development.  Research to date has worked with equations comprised              of braille numbers and letters and with tactile representations of              the math symbols that replace the often ambiguous braille math                  symbols.  Math equations are now presented in a spatial format as               they are for sighted people, unlike that used with braille.                     Fractions are printed as numerator over denominator.  Subscripts                and superscripts are printed in the proper sub- or superscripted                positions.  Limits of sums and integrals are printed in their                   normal positions.                                                               The symbols are represented by compact tactile patterns that can                be read more easily than the Braille math symbols.  The process is              referred to as the \"Dots+\" method.                                                                                                                              Research is being done to determine whether representation of                   common math symbols can be done with an enhanced 6-symbol cell                  with three distinguishable symbols, or if it will be necessary                  to use an 8-symbol cell with two symbols.  Work is also being                   done to use the enhanced Braille cell to represent alphabetic                   charters, greek, italic, bold, script, etc.  Non-overprinted                    attributes (for example, vector signs, dots, carets, tildes, and                other such things over a character) are being printed normally                  with some enhancement for readability.                                                                                                                          The printing technology needed for producing such dot+ equations                exists, but an actual machine does not.  The project has been                   promised a beta-test version of a desk-top plotter capable of                   making any of the required shapes.                                                                                                                              During the project, the Director is working with two                            undergraduate computer science students, one of whom is blind.                  In addition, he is researching international activities in                      aspects of blind technology.  The research being done should                    result in the ability to write equations for blind people that                  retain all the intuitive and conceptual advantages of visual                    equations.",
