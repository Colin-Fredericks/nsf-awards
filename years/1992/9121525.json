 "awd_abstract_narration": "An International Symposium on the History of Particle Physics is                being held at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center from June 24-              27, 1992.  This is the third in a series of such gathering that                 began at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in 1980.  A                  primary goal of these meetings is to identify principal themes and              critical problems, thereby laying the basis for future historical               studies of an important area of modern physics.  Themes to be                   explored in this symposium include the growth of large                          international scientific collaborations, the transition from fixed-             target to colliding beam modes of experimentation, the unification              of the weak and the electromagnetic forces, and the development of              the quark model of elementary particles.  While concentrating on                the \"Rise of the Standard Model\" in particle physics, the symposium             is not ignoring particle physics outside of this mainstream--eg.                papers are being given on the discovery of CP-violation.  By                    bringing together a group of prominent scientists together with                 leading historians, sociologists and philosophers of science, the               organizers aim to promote interdisciplinary collaboration in                    writing the history of recent science and to develop further the                methodology of using personal recollections of major contributors               as a tool for historical research.  The proceedings of the                      symposium are being carefully edited, extensively referenced and                supplemented with an introduction that discusses the historical                 context in which the development of the standard model occurred.",
