 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although herbs typically contribute only a minor fraction of               the total biomass or production of a forest, they may be                        critically important in regulating forest composition and                       dynamics through competition with tree seedlings.  However,                     because forests are extremely variable in herb abundance, the                   impact of herbs on tree establishment is not consistent.                        Resource competition theory leads to the prediction that under                  conditions of abundant soil nutrients and moisture but low light,               herbaceous plants will win in competition with woody plants,                    while higher light or lower soil resource levels should shift the               competitive interaction to favor woody plants.  Experimental                    manipulations of light and soil resources will be used the                      hypothesis that herbs on high-resource sites influence tree                     composition by reducing growth rates, and increasing mortality                  rates of tree seedlings.  Observation made along herb-cover                     gradients will be used to test the general hypothesis that the                  light:soil resource supply ratio determines the outcome of                      competition between woody and herbaceous plants in understories.                If this hypothesis is true, then canopy gaps, herb removal areas,               and other low resource microsites could play a critical role by                 shifting the competitive balance to be more favorable for tree                  seedlings.",
