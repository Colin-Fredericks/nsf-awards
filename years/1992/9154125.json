The project will have widespread                     impact on teachers, students and practitioners by providing                     twelve curriculum packages as models for (a) innovative                         instruction and (b) further curriculum development efforts                      of collaborative teams of teachers and practitioners from                       science, mathematics, engineering, design and technology.                       The inservice training of other teachers will be initiated                      regionally through participating teacher-training                               institutions as an initial step for national dissemination                      and training.  National dissemination of the models and                         materials will be accomplished mainly through TIES Magazine,                    a free periodical for teachers published by Drexel                              University.  The curriculum materials from Project UPDATE                       will support a national commitment to improve education in                      mathematics, science and technology by engaging students in                     using, discussing, assessing and reconstructing what they                       have learned as they continue to put their knowledge to                         work.",
