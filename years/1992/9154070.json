 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study will investigate the power of video in                           helping middle school students learn the mathematical bases                     of change over time.  By connecting digitized video images                      with powerful analytical software, environments will be                         created in which students can construct robust                                  understandings of the relationships among functions, changes                    in their values, and accumulations of changes.                                                                                                                       The plan is to use video as DATA, a view that renders                      video an active part of the analysis process, not merely a                      motivational ploy.  Thus, video becomes a new, flexible                         data-collection device that students can use to explore                         previously-inaccessible aspects of the world around them and                    to relate mathematics to science.                                                                                                                                    The project will produce and experiment with several                       prototype systems for using video to provide visible,                           salient connections between mathematics and science and to                      support the learning of basic concepts of change over time.                     These systems, coupled with descriptions of the roles they                      played in students' learning, will constitute one outcome of                    the project.  In the second phase of the project, we will                       design and implement a single system, based on the results                      of our experiences with prototypes.  The effects of this                        system will be evaluated by working with experts in focusing                    on several key mathematical concepts, constructing problems                     that embody the concepts, and comparing middle school                           students to college students with respect to these                              challenges. Through these activities we will understand the                     effect of various characteristics of the video technology on                    students' learning.",
