 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will create an entirely new approach to                      application prototyping process modification and error recovery in              manufacturing.  Human supervisors will communicate with robots and              other automated equipment like they might direct human                          subordinates-by pointing at locations while giving directives about             objects and actions.  This point-and-direct approach to                         manufacturing will allow new products to be introduced quickly and              will lead to continuous manufacturing improvement.  Changes and                 corrections will be made in nearly real-time.  The development of               a technology for remotely designating object orientation and                    position anywhere in an unstructured three-dimensional workspace                is critical in realizing point-and-direct strategic control in                  manufacturing.                                                                       This research in point-and-direct manufacturing will lead to               the development of a novel manufacturing control technology where               humans perform the task conception and scene interpretation                     functions for which they are well suited while machines perform the             task execution function at which machines excel.  Both small                    flexible enterprises, and large multiple-cell manufacturers will                be able to use this control strategy to employ robots and other                 intelligent machines with greater ease.",
