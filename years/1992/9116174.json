 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support cooperative research between                 Rene A. Carmona of the University of California at Irvine and                   Jean-Pierre Fouque, of the Center of Applied Mathematics at the                 Ecole Polytechnique in Paris.  Jean Lacroix of the University of                Paris X and Etienne Pardoux of the University of Provence in                    Marseille are also part of the French team.  The investigators will             examine the probabilistic properties and the asymptotic behavior of             the solutions of some stochastic partial differential equations.  They          will consider equations which are important to mathematical models              in oceanography.                                                                                                                                                Dr. Carmona is a leader in the field of stochastic partial differential         equations.  Collaboration with the French investigators will                    enhance different aspects of this project.  J.P. Fouque is an expert            on partial differential equations and Lacrois is experienced in the             theory of Luyapunov exponents, programming and random                           simulation.  Their respective backgrounds will contribute to solving            problems on the asymptotic properties of these equations. Pardoux               has interest and experience in mathematical problems in                         oceanography.  He will contribute to the development of                         mathematical models in this area.  Combining these complementary                strengths and interests will benefit the project.  The results will             advance our understanding of the theory of stochastic partial                   differential equations, an important and active area in the modern              theory of statistics and probability.",
