 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research planning grant will enable the researcher to                 continue her investigation into the relationship between                        permutation representations and the trace form in number fields.                The idea is to study how the trace form varies in a family of                   Galois extensions of number fields.                                                  This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                   theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                  divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                   oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,               it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for                computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.",
