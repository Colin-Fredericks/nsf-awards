 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the decline in fertility in the American                South between 1910 and 1940.  Most studies of the transition from               high to low fertility has focused on the national pattern.  There               were, however, striking regional variations in the timing and                   pace of the fertility decline.  This study will pay special                     attention to the sharp decline in childbearing in rural black                   families which took place between 1910 and 1940.  Public Use                    Samples from the 1910 and the 1940 Census will be used.  These                  data will be combined with data on the local area in which the                  household lives.                                                                     This study will provide a significant contribution to the                  large literature on the fertility transition by focusing on a                   part of American society which has not been much studied earlier.               The study will contribute to our understanding of why couples                   decided to have fewer children, and it will in particular shed                  light on the experiences of rural black families during the early               part of the twentieth century.",
