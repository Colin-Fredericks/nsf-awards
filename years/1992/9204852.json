At present these devices lack the                                        ability to produce or amplify light.  As a                                      result design must be kept conservative to                                      reduce optical loss, thus placing severe                                        limitations on the allowable number of                                          integrated optic elements and their packing                                     density.  Certain important functions, like                                     signal regeneration and fan-out (i.e., the                                      distribution of one data stream to many                                         outputs), must also be done electronically-                                     re-imposing both the bandwidth limitations                                      and the added complexity of electronics.  A                                     solution to these limitations is an integrable                                  guided wave optical element gain.  One of                                       the goals of the proposed research is to                                        fabricate a LiNbO3-based guided wave                                            optical amplifier, incorporating Er3+ as the                                    amplifying medium.  (Er has a strong                                            emission line at ~ 1500 nm, a wavelength                                        of importance for telecommunications                                            systems and well beyond the optical region                                      where optical damage to LiNbO3 can take                                         place.)  Toward this end, the PI has                                            recently developed a method for locally                                         incorporating much higher concentrations                                        of Er into LiNbO3 than previously reported.                                     This research has several promising                                             waveguide circuits which take advantage of                                      the unique characteristics of intersecting                                      waveguides.  We have previously                                                 developed a rigorous theory which                                               correctly explains both the coupling and                                        radiative loss characteristics of intersecting                                  optical waveguides and we are applying                                          this theory to the design and analysis of                                       Er:Ti:LiNbO3 guided wave optically                                              pumped amplifiers and light sources.                                            Preliminary measurements and calculations                                       indicate that reasonable gain coefficients (g                                   ~ 400m-1@ 1mW pump power) can be                                                obtained.  We propose to continue our                                           study of the enhanced incorporation of Er                                       by way of co-diffusion of Ti and to                                             investigate several other promising co-                                         diffusants.  In this study will also examine                                    the incorporation of pairs of rare earth                                        elements.  Such paired systems may                                              provide additional useful pump transitions                                      (e.g., diode laser) as well as more efficient                                   energy transfer mechanisms for optical                                          gain.  Site-selective fluorescence                                              spectroscopy will be used to characterize                                       the optical properties of rare earth ions in                                    the LiNbO3 matrix, as well as to identify the                                   substitution site and transport mechanisms                                      for this co-diffusion process.",
