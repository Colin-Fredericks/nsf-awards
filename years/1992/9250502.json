 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid development of computer power is shifting the focus                   of undergraduate science teaching away from reproduction of                     prescribed procedures to observing, investigating, and even                     discovering physical laws.  This project is using the                           analytical tools that were once available only to the research                  scientist, and that can now be used by undergraduates to                        visualize data and mathematical functions, to broaden the range                 of problems accessible to them, and to develop model-building                   and simulation skills.  Also, the computer has itself become an                 integral part of nearly all scientific instrumentation and its                  use must be included in the modern physics curriculum.The                       project is being implemented by developing a computing                          laboratory using the software packages Mathematica (for                         visualization and computational power), LabView (a data                         acquisition and analysis code), and LogicWorks and PSPlCE                       (electronics simulation codes).  The codes are being run on                     Macintosh IIci computers using computer interfaces and                          associated hardware from National Instruments.The Department of                 Physics of the University of Richmond is applying these new                     technologies to the introductory course program and are now                     being extended to the upper-division courses.  Quantum                          mechanics is one of most mathematically foreboding courses                      undergraduates face.  The laboratory is enabling students to                    experiment graphically and symbolically and to investigate the                  science more deeply.  We are also incorporating modern                          simulation and data acquisition and analysis techniques into                    our two-semester electronics sequence.  The students are                        learning to transform physical measurements into electrical                     signals, process the signals, and collect them with the                         computer.  They are using simulation software to design,                        develop, and test circuits.",
