 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Political Science at             the State University of New York at Stony Brook to establish a                  Research Experience for Undergraduates SITE.  Through this program              students will engage in research in one of several areas:                       political psychology, political economy, or the study of American               institution.  Via an intense eight-week immersion in an active                  research environment students will become aware of and excited by               the nature of modern political science, in terms of the issues,                 studies and the theoretical approaches and methodologies used to                study them.  Students will be exposed to a broad sampling of the                research techniques employed in modern political science.                       Specifically, experimental techniques emphasized in the study of                political psychology as well as the econometric and statistical                 skills emphasized by faculty who study political economy and                    American institutions will be the primary focus of students' work.              Recruitment efforts will center on small and regional colleges                  without research programs and colleges with large enrollments of                minorities and women.  Those selected to participate will reflect               the recruiting focus.  Support services, informal and structured                experiences are planned to encourage graduate study and/or                      research-oriented careers.",
