 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research centers on developing a new class of delay                   estimation architectures that can align two pseudonoise (PN) code               generators without resorting to serial search techniques. This is               a significant deviation from conventional methods of PN code                    synchronization and promises to significantly reduce the                        complexity and improve the performance of these subsystems. The                 new  architecture is constructed by inserting a filter                          between the local waveform generator and crosscorrelation                       multiplier of a conventional correlation loop. The produces a new               class of control loops that can generate useful error signals                   over a much wider range of timing errors than conventional loops,               such as delay locked loops and tau dither loops. The new device                 promises to be particularly effective at low signal to noise                    ratios and in hostile environments where conventional loops                     frequently loose lock and then re-acquire the signal. The goal of               this research is to fully develop the proposed architecture,                    determine its performance in a wide variety of environments, and                investigate the feasibility of implementing the devices with                    currently available technology.  Potential applications include                 improved Global Positioning System receivers, enhanced code                     division multiple access (CDMA) radio networks (including mobile                telephone CDMA systems),  and improvements in a variety of                      military and commercial spread spectrum systems.",
