 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lawrence Hall of Science, in conjunction with New York                      Hall of Science and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific,                    will offer a series of three-week summer institutes to                          experienced elementary and middle school teachers from                          throughout the United States.  The institutes will provide a                    range of experiences and resources for teaching astronomy                       and space science through classroom activities keyed to                         participatory planetarium programs, modern science updates,                     and field trips to observatories and planetariums.  Two                         institutes per summer, each accommodating 25 teacher-                           leaders, will be conducted in 1992, 1993, and 1994, for a                       total of 150 teacher-leaders.  Participants will communicate                    with an additional 100 teacher-leaders who attended similar                     institutes in 1989-90, via newsletters and meetings at NSTA                     national conventions.                                                                                                                                           This proposal is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        Program because it is national in scope, and is designed to                     enhance science education in an area of science that is                         growing in its impact upon and interest to teachers and                         their students, but about which most teachers have little or                    no background.                                                                                                                                                  Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 66% of the amount                         requested from NSF.",
