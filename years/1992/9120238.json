 "awd_abstract_narration": "The extraordinary resistance of bacterial spores, the diversity of              sporeforming species, and the importance (good and bad) of                      sporeformers to medicine, to food processing and to agriculture                 were major stimuli for early research on spore formation.                       Increasingly, spore formation has been seen and studied as a                    primitive form of cell differentiation.  The emphasis of the                    present conference is regulation of expression of genes that                    control sporulation.  The program is designed to convey a picture               of the whole process of differentiation for a vegetative bacterium              into a spore, and to relate spore formation to other post-                      exponential stress responses.  One session will be devoted to the               related process of vegetative cell division.  The conference which              will convene in Woods Hole, Massachusetts on May 9-13, 1992, will               bring together leading scientists from around the world, and will               highlight exciting recent developments.  The formats of the                     conference is designed to maximize interaction among participants.",
