 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Third Biennial Mammalian Developmental Genetics Workshop will               be held in Bar Harbor, 8-12 September, 1993.  This Third Workshop               builds on the highly successful workshops held in Bar Harbor in                 1989 and 1991.  Emphasis will be placed on the mouse as a model                 species.  The program will consist of keynote presentations, topic              sessions, and 'brainstorming' sessions.  Keynote presentations will             provide an overview of broad developmental questions; topic                     sessions will emphasize specific developmental problems; and                    'brainstorming' meetings will emphasize strategies for studying                 important but poorly understood developmental problems.  For the                Third Workshop, the keynote presentations will focus on genes that              control mouse development and on the genetics of human birth                    defects; topic sessions will focus on the genetics of hearing and               vision, gene expression in early development, the genetic control               lineage determination and the genetic control of sex determination              and gametogenesis; and 'brainstorming' sessions will focus on the               developmental impact of environmental insults and on the genetic                control of programmed cell death.  Each topic session will begin                with an invited 60 minute presentation providing an overview of the             research problems and progress for the subject of that section.                 These overviews will be followed by two or three 20 minute, more                narrowly focused, complementary presentations.  Presentors will be              selected by the Organizers form attendee applications.  Attendance              will be limited to 110.  Participation of graduate students and                 postdoctoral fellows is encouraged.  Abstracts will be provided to              attendees but will not be published.  Poster presentations are                  encouraged.",
