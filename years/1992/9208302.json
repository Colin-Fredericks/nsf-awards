 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are a number of quite general related questions in model             theory which are connected with concrete combinatorial problems.                Cherlin will study several which represent fairly broad and poorly              understood areas.  In particular, the following questions will be               considered.  (1) Is the generic triangle-free graph pseudofinite.               (2) Is there a zero-one law for large finite labelled directed                  graphs containing no transitive tournament of order 3.  (3) What is             the minimal complexity of a language, admitting quantifier                      elimination, for the structures given by the action of the wreath               product Sym(n)*Sym(d) in its action on d-tuples of k-sets?  (4)                 What is the classification of infinite primitive homogeneous                    structures for a language with three symmetric 2-types, under the               hypothesis that a negative constraint is imposed on a substructure              of order three.  The co-investigator, Thomas, will continue related             work on reducts and expansions of omega-categorical structures.  He             also plans to study omega-stable group actions and independence                 results on infinite symmetric groups.                                                The subarea of model theory within mathematical logic concerns             itself with axiomatic systems, particularly questions about                     theories founded on systems of axioms, which can be answered purely             from considering the forms of the axioms without real regard for                their content.  It is surprising how much can sometimes be learned              in this way, for it often seems to be getting something for                     nothing.  Model theorists have developed a rich subject and have                been able to shed light even on such well-studied topics in algebra             as the theory of groups and the theory of fields.",
