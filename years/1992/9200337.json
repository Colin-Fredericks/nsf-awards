 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Minority Research Award Planning activity is directed                      toward the use of enzymes to facilitate organic functional                      group transformation under extremely mild conditions often                      providing products in high yield.  Enzymes have been shown to                   be useful reagents in synthetic organic chemistry.  This                        project suggests the utilization of enzymes in the synthesis of                 macrocyclic lactones, porphyrins, and certain classes of                        tropane alkaloids.  A major goal of this planning activity is                   to identify those enzymes capable of these transformations and                  to devise synthetic methodology involving enzymes in the                        preparation of these three classes of compounds.  Preliminary                   experiments to strengthen the planned research proposal will be                 conducted utilizing undergraduate students.                                     %%%                                                                             Enzymes are catalysts for many biochemical reactions.  In the                   past decade they have shown great promise as laboratory                         reagents in the synthesis of new organic compounds with great                   specificity and in high yield.  A research proposal will be                     prepared concurrently with the activities planned in this                       project.",
