 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine the processes leading to the passage              of legislation to bail out the savings and loan industry.  The                 study will focus on three questions:  What forces caused bank                   deregulation and its unintended consequences of the savings and                 loan crisis?  What forces caused Congress and the executive federal             government to contradict prevailing laissez-faire philosophy and                agree to the most expensive bailout in United States history? What              actors were most critical in shaping the deregulation and bailout               legislation?   The study will primarily be based on data extracted              from the 34 volumes of testimony transcripts and supporting                     documents from the Congressional investigations into the crisis.                       The significance of the study is twofold.  It will offer                 important insights into the events leading up to the savings and                loan crisis and to the social problems it in turn created.  This                may be useful for policy makers and it may influence the debate on              the future of the banking industry and in particular the savings                and loan industry.  The study will also contribute to our                       understanding of the role of the state in the shaping of corporate              welfare, and thus possibly to an expansion of the concept of the                welfare state to include not only social welfare but also the                   welfare of corporations and businesses.",
