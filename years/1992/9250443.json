 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics at the University of Evansville                   plans to improve its curriculum by implementing a computer-                     oriented approach in the calculus-differential equations                        sequence and in a calculus course for majors outside                            mathematics, engineering, and science.  The use of a computer                   algebra system in a computer laboratory classroom, for student                  exercises and projects, and as an instructional aid allows a                    shift of emphasis from manipulative  skills and techniques to                   activities with the computer that promote discovery,                            development of intuition, more realistic and meaningful                         applications, student interaction, improved expository skills,                  and experience with the computer as a modern mathematical tool.                 As an early phase of the project, the Department of Mathematics                 is initiating an intensive effort with the major departments                    served to arrive at consensus on what manipulative skills and                   techniques the students should be able to perform by hand and                   what tasks are more appropriate for the computer.  The results                  will serve as a model for mathematics departments with a heavy                  service load in the areas of engineering and/or the natural                     sciences.",
