 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposal is to significantly enhance the                     quantity and quality of our current data base of digital images                 of solar active regions and activity by providing funds to                      purchase the recording equipment needed to save approximately                   5,500 images per day from the five full-time SOON observations                  located around the world.  We plan to install dual Exabyte 2.3                  Gbyte tape drives at the five sites and to archive approximately                1,100 selected images per day per site.  The purpose for this                   archival process is to make these invaluable data available to                  the entire scientific community for detailed studies of flares                  and active region evolution.  The effort is intended to augment                 the infrastructure of the solar physics community by providing an               unprecedented continuous coverage of the majority of solar active               regions with high spatial resolution and moderate temporal                      resolution.  We believe that the creation of the proposed                       archival data base of SOON images will form a major cornerstone                 of observations relating to flare triggering, flare build-up and                energetics as well as active region evolution.  This nearly                     continuous solar data set needs to be saved and placed (in a                    convenient way) in the hands of the solar physics community and                 compared with other data to provide new understandings of solar                 flares.",
