 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research takes a new approach to understanding the changes                 occurring in solution chemistry during localized corrosion.  Ion                chromatography is employed to probe the progression of solution                 chemistry within occluded cells.  Ion chromatography is capable of              detecting nanogram quantities of a wide variety of ions in solution             volumes as low as 10 microliters.  This technique permits the                   analysis of changes in solution chemistry at localized corrosion                sites such as in crevices.  New insights can be obtained into the               fundamental processes that control corrosion pit formation and                  propagation.  Surface analysis techniques (Auger spectroscopy and               X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) are used to examine the                       composition of passive films and surface corrosion layers that form             before and after the onset of corrosion.                                        %%%                                                                             Localized corrosion of metals and alloys in aqueous environments is             an especially damaging form of environmental attack.  It has                    generally been accepted that the cause of the initiation and                    propagation of a localized corrosion site is the formation of a                 highly aggressive environment in an occluded cell that comprises                the area of attack.  Understanding obtained from the approach                   described in this study could have a significant impact on the                  development of strategies for mitigating pitting and crevice                    corrosion.",
