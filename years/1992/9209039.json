 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to address the well known problems of social                   choice in environments more realistic than those normally                       considered.  In particular, the researcher will alter the                       requirements of universal domain, binary-ness, and transitivity                 commonly assumed in work on social choice.  These requirements are              among the most basic for researchers working within the general                 framework established by Kenneth Arrow in 1951.                                                                                                                 This study will adopt choice axioms shaped by the exigencies for                real world computation and develop algorithms generating a member               of the set of best outcomes to allow for more latitude in the                   choice of a computational procedure.  This is because society may               wish to sacrifice some computational efficiency to open the door                to a social choice rule that has more desirable ethical properties              than a more efficient algorithm would permit.                                                                                                                   The goal is to examine the possibility of defining an efficient,                nonbinary, social choice correspondence that can be used to settle              the kinds of distributional welfare questions that typically                    confronted economists.  This important study represents a move                  toward greater realism in the basic models, and permits a much                  better fit between social choice theory and standard economic                   models.",
