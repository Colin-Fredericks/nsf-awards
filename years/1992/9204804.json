 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mathematical research supported by this award continues                work on the development of a nonlinear harmonic analysis on                     integrable equations in connection with inverse scattering                      theory. Central to the project is a steepest decent method for                  analyzing the asymptotics of oscillatory Riemann-Hilbert problems               of the kind that arise in the theory of integrable nonlinear                    equations.  To date the method has been applied to the modified                 Korteweg-deVries equation and the defocusing nonlinear                          Schrodinger equation.                                                                The steepest descent method mentioned above gives long time                asymptotics of solutions to Cauchy problems integrable by the                   inverse scattering method.  A great deal of work has been done                  along the same lines, but much is formal and very little is                     rigorous.  This project will first seek to analyze the zero                     dispersion limit problems for Korteweg-deVries equations, that                  is, to study directly the corresponding oscillatory Riemann-                    Hilbert problem.  It is expected that the new method will not                   require any spectral assumptions, and that, once worked out, will               apply to a broad class of problems.                                                  A second line of research will consider Hamiltonians arising               as transverse Ising models at the critical transverse magnetic                  field.  The corresponding autocorrelation function can be                       computed from the solution of the associated Riemann-Hilbert                    problem.  Preliminary calculations give results different from                  previous formal results of others.  Work will be done to justify                these discoveries and to continue work on a class of related                    integrable statistical models to compute the large time behavior                of the autocorrelation function.",
