 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fish order Characiformes comprises the most important                  group of freshwater fishes living in Africa and in Central and                  South America. They have been studied extensively because of their              economic importance as food and as aquarium resources (for example,             the \"tetras\"), and because of their remarkable adaptations to                   numerous kinds of aquatic environments, including the infamous                  predatory habits of the piranhas. However, the evolutionary                     relationships among the major families of characiform fishes are                poorly understood, and morphological characters alone promise                   little help in resolving the matter.                                                 Faculty advisor Axel Meyer will assist graduate student                    Guillermo Orti in an extensive molecular systematic survey of                   mitochondrial DNA variation in representative samples of the major              characiform groups. The amount and kind of mutational differences               in mitochondrial DNA between fish species indicate relative degree              of genealogical relationship, and thus provide data to infer the                phylogeny of these lineages. Insight into the evolutionary history              of this species-rich group of fishes will in turn help in                       understanding the geographical diversification between African and              South American faunas following the geological breakup of Gondwana.",
