 "awd_abstract_narration": "The junctions of a rearrangement in which DNA sequences which are               noncontiguous in the germ line genome are joined during development             of the somatic nucleus have been cloned.  There is a long inverted              repeat near the rearrangement junctions which contains two                      different 19bp tandemly repeated sequences.  The 19mers are also                associated with each other at other rearrangement sites, which                  suggests that they have a functional role in rearrangement.                     Molecular analysis of the rearrangement junctions and of the                    products of rearrangements from the macronucleus will be extended               in order to determine the full length of the inverted repeat and                the nucleotide sequence at junction sites.  Cis-acting sequences                for DNA rearrangement will be identified by analysis of DNA                     rearrangement on constructs microinjected into developing                       macronuclei.  Cis-acting sequences will be used in gel-shift assays             to identify sites which are specifically bound by proteins during               DNA rearrangement.                                                                                                                                              DNA rearrangement is a basic biological process which occurs in a               variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals.  The goal of             the proposed study is to understand the molecular mechanisms                    involved in developmentally regulated rearrangement in the ciliated             protozoan Tetrahymena.***//",
