 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to permit Dr. Karl F. Freed,                          Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, to pursue                       with Dr. Hosung Sun, Department of Chemistry, Pusan                             National University, for 24 months, a program of                                cooperative research on effective Hamiltonian theories of                       molecular electronic structure.  Their research formerly                        was supported under NSF Grant No. INT-8713123.  These                           scientists and members of their research groups will                            continue their treatment of effective operators for                             properties other than energy in order to provide a more                         sensitive test of the utility of ab initio                                      quasidegenerate many-body perturbation methods (QDMBPT).                        They will continue to develop the necessary methods for                         calculating dipole moments, transition dipoles, diagonal                        and off-diagonal spin-orbit couplings, other nonadiabatic                       couplings, relativistic corrections, etc.                                                                                                                       The ab initio and semiempirical theories of molecular                           electronic structure provide two distinct approaches to                         determining the relationship between observed properties                        and electronic structure.  The present project is an ab                         initio attempt to develop the mathematical tools with                           which molecular properties can be calculated.  The two                          scientists bring complementary skills to bear on the                            collaborative research.  Dr. Freed will provide much of                         the formal input, the connections with semiempirical                            methods, and the students to do some of the programming                         and carry out the applications.  Dr. Sun will supervise                         the sophisticated aspects of algorithm and code                                 development, with some contributions to formal theory and                       applications.  Their past collaboration has been highly                         successful.  This project is relevant to the objectives                         of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks                       to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and                           Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of                         scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and                       through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.                            Korean participation in the project is supported by the                         Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).",
