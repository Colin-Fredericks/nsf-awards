 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural                   anthropologist in Papua New Guinea.  The student will study how                 husbands and wives establish authority in communications in                     public, private and ritual settings.  By accompanying couples                   into the rural forested areas and recording conversations and                   speech in various public and private situations the student will                document and compare variations in cultural knowledge and analyze               how they are used differently by men and women in social                        interaction.  The research will use cognitive anthropological                   models of analysis to test the hypothesis that women's authority                is greatest in private domains.                                                                                                                                 This research is important because it can help us understand the                role of gender in interpersonal relations.  By providing a cross                cultural comparison to studies done in Western societies, the                   study has the potential to advance our theoretical understanding                of gender (a current book by Tanner on this subject, drawn from                 Western society studies, has been on the best seller lists for                  weeks\u001b).",
