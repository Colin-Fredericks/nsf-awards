 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of modern biology is becoming dependent on complex models,                 analyses and theoretical tests that depend directly on the                      applications of modern mathematics and computer science.  For                   example, the construction of very large DNA sequences and genetic               marker maps require considerable computer analysis as well as                   efforts of organizing and maintaining such information in timely                accessible databases.  In addition, the identification of                       functions encoded within the genetic sequences have also been                   obtained using computer-aided comparative sequence and complex                  pattern search methods.  The work conducted under this award will               provide support for research into the development of these                      technologies and validation of their application to fundamental                 questions in the biology with several major goals:                              1)  The further automation of the ARIEL pattern induction and                   domain expert assistant system.  The use of \"massively parallel\"                computer hardware will be continued.                                            2)  The extension of the pattern system to utilize more global                  structural and functional information, e.g. the overall protein                 structural domain classification or the cellular organelle                      localization.                                                                   3)  Development of proper statistical methods for evaluating the                likelihood of an induced pattern being obtained by chance.  This                will involve the study of a number of pattern representation                    \"languages\" and the selection of proper negative control sets.",
