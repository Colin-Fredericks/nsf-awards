 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, there has been a significant increase in the use of                 techniques from applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as                    expert systems to implement the control functions for complex                   industrial processes.  The research funded is showing that the                  design of such expert controllers (controllers implemented via                  expert systems) can be accomplished using the same design                       philosophy as that used for fuzzy controllers.  Moreover, to                    ensure that such expert controllers can be trusted in critical                  environments (e.g., aircraft control, spacecraft control, process               control) this research is developing a discrete event system                    (DES) theoretic framework for the modeling and analysis of expert               control systems.  In particular, a mathematical model is                        introduced that can represent \"rule-based\" expert systems and a                 wide class of processes.  Techniques from DES theory are being                  developed for the analysis of reachability (to study inference                  chains), cyclic behavior (to verify that the expert system will                 not get stuck in circular reasoning), and stability properties                  (to verify critical properties related to the safe operation of                 expert control systems).  The application of the approach to the                solution of a load balancing problem in flexible manufacturing                  systems and process control problems is being investigated.                     Moreover, implementation issues for expert controllers are being                investigated via the implementation of an expert controller for a               flexible link manipulator.//",
