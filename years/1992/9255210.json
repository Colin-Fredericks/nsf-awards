(2)  Provide an education program for Native American, Hispanic and             other minority students to obtain the B.S. degree and to go on to               graduate work in the areas of improving resource management.                                                                                                    This program will focus on:  (a) Increasing the participation of                minorities, women and under-represented groups in the science,                  engineering and agricultural economics disciplines, and encouraging             more students to pursue graduate studied (This will include                     implementing summer camps for middle school students and a regional             conference for high school, community college, and university                   students in the four corners area to encourage them to pursue a                 career in science and engineering and to inform them about the                  project, to be funded by Summer Science Camps Program) and (b)                  Developing a teamwork learning environment that includes                        undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and outside                  corporations (NAPI).",
