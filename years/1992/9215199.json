 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is on the design of efficient algorithms for                  combinatorial problems on graphs.  A major focus is on                          crossing families.  Such families are exemplified by the                        minimum cuts of a graph; problems involving minimum cuts                        include issues of edge connectivity, graph augmentation and                     orientation, feedback sets on planar graphs and others.  The                    first part of the project is to develop a compact                               representation for crossing families.  Many problems on                         crossing families can be solved using the framework of                          submodular network flow.  Currently algorithms for submodular                   flow run in high-degree polynomial time.  An important goal of                  the project is to make such algorithms more efficient.  One of                  the main tools to achieve the goal will be the new                              representation - it allows the efficient computation of                         information commonly needed for submodular-flow type                            algorithms.  Crossing families also arise in the study of                       graph rigidity and scene analysis.  The project will develop                    efficient algorithms for applications in these areas and                        others.  Related issues in the study of graph connectivity;                     and optimization on matroids will also be investigated.  The                    goals of this project help increase knowledge about succinct                    representation of information and efficient computation on                      discrete structures.",
