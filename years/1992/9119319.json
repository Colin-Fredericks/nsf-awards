 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harmonic analysis has played an important role in a broad                       range of areas.  Computer scientists have begun using it as a                   tool for resolving questions about combinatorial circuits.  In                  number theory and other mathematical disciplines, proofs                        obtained via harmonic analysis turn out to be astonishingly                     powerful.  This research will develop new, efficient and                        useful learning algorithms, new computational models and new                    mathematical relationships among finite functions through the                   use of harmonic expressions.  It will consider harmonic                         expressions themselves (independent of their relation to                        circuits) as models of finite functions.                                                                                                                        The computational theory of finite functions has grown over                     the last several decades.  The ability to discern and exploit                   the structure of finite functions in computational settings                     has improved dramatically.  The improvements have basically                     followed innovations in the models of computation which are                     studied.  For the past fifteen years, the model which has                       dominated the interpretation of how finite computations should                  be examined is the combinatorial circuit, wherein calculations                  are performed on Boolean values passing through logic gates.                    Placing constraints on the measurable aspects of circuits                       (e.g., their depth, their size in gates and which logic-gates                   are employed) isolates and delineates understandable classes                    of finite functions.  The most important and famous of these                    are the log-depth, polynomial-size functions (NC), the                          constant-depth, polynomial-size functions (AC), the constant-                   depth thresh-old circuits, whose gates are threshold functions                  (TC), and the monotone polynomial-size circuits, which allow                    no negations.                                                                                                                                                   These classes play both theoretical and practical roles.  The                   class NC corresponds well with functions that have a hope of                    being computed fast in parallel by plausibly-sized parallel                     machines.  The class AC corresponds with the functions that                     can be expressed by reasonably-sized programmable logic                         arrays.  And the class TC is intimately related to the class                    of functions represented by artificial neural networks, and                     may well model newer optical computing devices.  Thus, the                      strong motivation for studying circuits is to obtain improved                   insights into parallel programming, VLSI chip design, theories                  of learning and brain-like computation, and the potentials of                   new computing technologies.",
