 "awd_abstract_narration": "The value and applications of adhesives are almost limitless in                 daily human existence. The bioadhesives synthesized and secreted                by barnacles, unlike most man-made adhesives, forms bonds under                 water. This characteristic may prove useful in dental, medical,                 mariculture, building and construction, and other industrial                    applications. We have collected samples of an adhesive secretion                from local barnacles held in sea water culture in our laboratory.               The application of both standard and innovative adhesion tests will             advance our knowledge of the mechanical and chemical interactions               that occur at the interface of various substrates and this adhesive             secretion under water. Electrophoretic and chromatographic                      components of the barnacle adhesive secretion that exhibit adhesive             properties. Microscopic studies of barnacles will pinpoint the                  cells that synthesize and secrete adhesive macromolecules.                                                                                                      Isolation and purification of the macromolecules will allow                     additional studies and applications of these important materials.               In the future, it is reasonable to expect that genetic engineering              methods will produce synthetic barnacle bioadhesives in sufficient              quantities to satisfy dental, medical, household, and industrial                needs. Moreover, after determining the chemical basis of adhesion               of barnacle \"glue\", could be synthesized. The incorporation of such             anti-adhesives into marine surface coatings could minimize                      environmental pollution and the economic impact of barnacles on the             boaters, shippers, and navies of the world.",
