 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Steven Brandt, Mr Audax Mabulla, a                   graduate student at the Univeristy of Florida, will collect data                for his doctoral dissertation. His archaeological research is                   focussed on the Lake Eyasi Basin located in northern Tanzania.                  Mr. Mabulla and his collaborators will conduct a surface survey                 of this 2,500 square km region.  Within each of the four major                  ecological zones which are present he will employ a stratified                  random sampling technique.  Selected areas will be located with                 aerial photographs and topographic maps.  All archaeological                    remains within them will be noted and described.  Supplemental                  auger and shovel testing will be conducted to locate buried                     remains and to detect patterns of soil modification.  If time                   allows two or three Middle Stone Age -Late Stone Age (MSA-LSA)                  archaeological occurrences will be test excavated to recover                    datable material, and subsistence data.  With this information                  Mr. Mabulla will attempt to reconstruct subsistence and land use                strategies during these two periods of time.                                                                                                                    While archaeological, genetic and paleontological data strongly                 suggest that \"modern\" humans first appear in Africa, the timing                 and details of this process are little understood.                              Archaeologists have only limited knowledge of how these cultures                adapted to the landscape or the subsistence practices they                      followed.  The social organization of these groups are also not                 well understood. Prior work at rock shelters in this area have                  revealed the presence of Middle Stone Age peoples who may be                    members of this first \"modern\" group.  Succeeding Late Stone Age                peoples with a quite different lithic technology are also                       present.  While rock shelters can provide useful information                    about adaptation to a very limited area, they cannot be used to                 understand broader regional strategies.  The information                        collected by Mr. Mabulla, because it covers a larger area can                   fill this gap.  Through use of both ethnographic comparison and                 LSA analysis, a \"modern\" pattern can be established and the                     earlier MSA one compared to it.                                                                                                                                 This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed                   light on the processes which lead to the emergence of modern                    humans.  It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists                and assist in the training of an extremely promising young                      scientist.",
