 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of social networks and community response to               a natural disaster.  It will survey officials and a random sample               of residents in an area of South Louisiana recently devastated by               hurricane Andrew, to learn the roles played by informal and                     formal social structures in shaping individuals' actions before,                during, and immediately after the storm.  In particular,                        individuals in highly dense networks are predicted to behave very               differently from those in more extensive networks, for example in               how quickly they evacuated their homes.  Furthermore, individuals               may use different portions of their social network to seek                      different kinds of aid.  The study employs well-developed                       techniques for collecting network data, and it will analyze them                with appropriate statistical methods.                                                                                                                                The hurricane offers a practically unique opportunity to                   examine human behavior under extreme conditions, extending the                  knowledge social scientists have gained in research on more usual               conditions.  Well grounded in standard sociological theory, this                study promises significant scientific gains.  But it also will                  offer insights to help community leaders communicate and provide                social services more effectively in times of crisis.",
