 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major goals of the undergraduate laboratory                          curriculum is to graduate physics majors who are familiar with                  modern instrumentation and are trained to interface this                        instrumentation with a computer.  Their physics majors are                      required to take a course in the computer control and computer                  acquisition and analysis of data.  Modern instrumentation is                    required in the advanced undergraduate laboratory so that they                  are able to build on the training students have received in                     this course.They are adding a variable temperature facility to                  the advanced undergraduate laboratories.  This equipment                        includes a cryocooler and associated temperature control and                    measurement instrumentation and additional instruments with                     computer interface to use with experiments performed on this                    cryocooler.  This facility allows them to introduce condensed                   matter physics experiments into the laboratory curriculum so                    that students are being trained in the area of study most of                    them will pursue after graduation.",
