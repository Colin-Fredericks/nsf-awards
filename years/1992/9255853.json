 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, from the Quality Education for Minorities                        Network, is designed to support a working conference whose                      agenda is the conceptualization of a national strategy to                       improve the education, especially the mathematics and science                   education, of children and youth living in low-income                           residential communities (LRCs).  Attendees, approximately 60                    working  participants and 25 observers, will include                            representatives of HBCUs and predominately minority                             institutions, school districts, professional organizations and                  human service agencies.  The conference is planned for 8/28-                    30, 1992.                                                                                                                                                       A national organization, the Housing Development Network, will                  be established as an outcome of the conference and will be                      hosted by QEM.  Its major purpose will be to promote linkages                   between universities, housing developments LRCs, community-                     based organizations, health and social service agencies, and                    local housing authorities. Attendees at a small follow-up                       conference  will write  the Conference Proceedings.                                                                                                             This project is an extremely cost-effective yet substantive                     way of addressing one of the Nation's largest problems and                      shows potential for reaching out to a large number of                           institutions, youth and teachers.  The influence it might                       exert is increased by its probable joint sponsorship of a                       number of federal agencies.                                                                                                                                     Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 23% of the amount                         requested from NSF.",
