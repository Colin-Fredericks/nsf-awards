 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to study the growth and                development of the temporal bone in humans and non-human                        primates.  This will provide the background for interpreting the                data from the hominid fossil record thereby allowing for further                understanding of the evolutionary history of humans.                                                                                                            The temporal bone, the bone of the skull housing the ear, is                    important to anthropologists for two reasons:                                       1)  It is a highly complex structure and thus has a high                    information density.  Aside from containing the organs for                      hearing and balance, the temporal bone serves as the portion of                 the skull that articulates with the mandible and thus plays a                   major role in chewing and diet.  This complexity leads to a high                degree of variability among species.  Therefore the temporal bone               is crucial to our understanding of the relationships of fossil                  specimens.                                                                           2)  The petrous portion of the temporal bone is one of the                 densest areas of the body. This part of the skeleton is thus one                of the likliest to fossilize and thereby be represented in the                  fossil record.                                                                                                                                                  The examination of development of this bone and its concomitant                 structures will provide an additional dimension of information to               the hominid fossil record beyond that provided by examination of                the adult forms.",
