The              conference will take place September 7-11, 1992, in Wadern,                     Germany.  The bulk of the award will support the travel costs of                new researchers in this area.  Molecular bioinformatics is an area              in applied computer science which is rapidly gaining significance               due to the explosion of basic data from molecular biology.  This                area is concerned with the development of methods and tools for                 analyzing and understanding the relationships between and the                   functions of macromolecules.  The design of large biomolecules is               an area of increasing importance that depends critically on                     computation.  The workshop will be interdisciplinary (molecular                 biology, computer science, applied mathematics).  The workshop will             focus on the following topics:  alignment of biomolecular sequences             (DNA, RNA, protein); interpreting nucleotide sequences and their                role in gene regulation; determining large genomic sequences by                 shotgun and other methods such as hybridization; modeling of large              biomolecules, including the prediction and analysis of secondary                and higher-level structure as well as spatial conformations                     (folding); molecular dynamics and simulations of interactions                   between biomolecules.",
