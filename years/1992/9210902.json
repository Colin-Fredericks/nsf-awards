The approach uses laser ablation  as             the primary film growth method, and includes consideration of                   lattice matching between the substrate and the deposited magnetic               films.  Permanent magnet compounds that have uniaxial anisotropy                and are lattice matched to either (100) or (111) GaAs substrates                will be investigated.  Examples are the t-MnAl phase(CuAu-type),                its related ternary alloys MnAlM(M=Ni, Cu, Zn) which are compatible             with (100) GaAs, and the NiAs-type structure such as MnBi, MnSb,                and MnBiSb compatible with (111) GaAs substrates.  Characterization             of the structural, compositional, and magnetic properties of the                films is an integral part of the research.                                      %%%                                                                             This research addresses the epitaxial growth of thin films of                   magnetic materials on compound semiconductors which offers many                 possibilities for the discovery of new devices and the integration              of magnetic storage media and active electronic or opto-electronic              components for improvements in devices and integrated circuits used             in computing, information processing, and telecommunications.",
