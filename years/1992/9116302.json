 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports cooperative research involving Paul              A. Heiney, of the University of Pennsylvania and Roger Moret and                Patrick Bernier of the University of Paris (South), Orsay.  They                will determine the long and short-range structural ordering in                  fullerites and their alkali metal intercalation compounds.                      Intramolecular bonding and molecular orientational order will be                probed by x-ray diffraction techniques.  These studies will be                  complemented by NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) experiments                    to determine the short-range interatomic, intermolecular and atomic             molecular interactions in doped phases.                                                                                                                         Fullerites are a new class of materials with superconducting                    capabilities.  The principal objective of this study is to identify the         origin of their metallic and superconducting behavior and to                    determine their properties.  A mixture of X-ray diffraction and                 NMR techniques will provide complementary information and data.                 Dr. Heiney brings to this collaboration experience in fullerite                 synthesis.  This is complemented by French expertise for                        combining high pressure and low temperature x-ray diffraction,                  which will be crucial for determining the structure of fullerites.              The project will also benefit from access to the synchrotron                    radiation facility at Orsay.",
