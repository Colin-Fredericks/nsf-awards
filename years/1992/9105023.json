 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will allow Bishop Museum in Honolulu to                       conserve and rehouse its mollusk collection in new metal storage                cabinets.  This collection (6 million specimens in 240,000 lots,                including 900 holotypes and 24,000 other types) is dominated by                 Pacific land snails, and ranks as the ninth largest mollusk                     collection in the U.S.  Two-thirds of the land snail specimens                  have associated alcohol-preserved soft parts in the collection.                 The project follows from a 1987 conservator's report that                       recommended 1) replacing all land snail specimen trays with acid-               free unit trays and/or polystyrene boxes, 2) replacing all wooden               cabinets and drawers with metal fixtures, and 3) removing all                   cardboard boxes in and around the storage area.  Temperature and                humidity fluctuations have been controlled by the Bishop by                     installing several window air conditioning units.  Rehousing of                 this collection will not only conserve this international                       research resource, but will make it much more accessible for                    education and research in the biology of mollusks.",
