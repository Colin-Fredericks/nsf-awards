 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the experimental analysis of delayed                     consistency in large-scale cache-based multiprocessors including its            effects on false sharing and latency tolerance.  False sharing refers           to the read/write sharing of cache blocks in the absence of data                sharing in a parallel computation.   Latency tolerance refers to the            reduction of the average latency of shared-memory accesses by                   overlapping them with computation.                                                                                                                              Delayed consistency takes advantage of weak ordering in cache-based             systems.  The sending of cache invalidation can be delayed, in which            case they can be overlapped with processor accesses to the cache.               Additionally, both the sending and receiving of invalidations can be            delayed, in which case false sharing effects are reduced by increasing          the time during which cached blocks remain accessible by each local             processor.                                                                                                                                                      The quantitative effects of delaying consistency and its variants will          be evaluated through execution-driven simulation of parallel benchmark          programs, including nine parallel numerical as well as non-numerical            algorithms and thirteen Fortran programs contained in the Perfect Club          Benchmark suite, parallelized using an Alliant 2800 compiler.                   Emphasis will be on the effects of block size, cache size, and                  granularity of parallelism.  Statistics will be collected not only on           miss rates, but also on memory traffic, on memory access latencies and          on total execution times.",
