 "awd_abstract_narration": "New Photonic Material from Genetically Engineered                               Bacteriorhodopsin.  There exists a need for photonic materials                  that have superior photochromic, photovoltaic, or nonlinear                     optical (NLO) characteristics.  This research will develop a new                family of materials based on the protein bacteriorhodopsin                      (BR), a unique biological material which has promising                          photochromic, photooltaic, and nonlinear optical properties                     needed for device application (e.g. holographic recording                       films, associative holographic memories, spatial light                          modulators, etc.). To fully realize the potential of devices                    based on BR one must produce mutant BRs at a scale suitable for                 rapid analysis and fabrication and be able to screen these mutant               Brs rapidly for important photochromic properties (second harmonic              generation). Mutants construction from the gene coding for                      BR (bop) will use an expression system which has recently been                  developed.  In this system mutant BR's are synthesized in their                 natural host and not in E. coli as is currently the custom.                     This method allows the rapid and facile production of large                     quantities of mutant proteins derived by site-directed                          mutagenesis.  The photochromic properties, the photovoltaic                     properties, and the nonlinear optical properties of the BR variants             will be assessed.  This effort involves the close collaboration of              investigators with expertise in three different areas: genetics                 (Richard Needleman). photochemistry (Janos Lanyi) and physics                   (George Rayfield).  A strong industrial collaboration (Bend                     Research Inc, Bend Oregon) is also part of this program.                        %%%                                                                             There exists a need for materials that have superior responses to               light than man-made products currently in existence.  This research             will develop a new family of materials based on the protein                     bacteriorhodopsin (BR), a unique biological material which has                  promising light sensitive and photoelectric properties                          needed for device application (e.g. holographic recording                       films, associative holographic memories, spatial light                          modulators, etc.). To fully realize the potential of devices                    based on BR one must produce mutant Brs at a scale suitable for                 rapid analysis and fabrication to screen these mutant Brs for                   important photochromic properties. Mutants proteins will be                     obtained from the gene coding for BR inserted into a bacterial                  expression system involving the natural host; this method allows                the rapid and facile production of large quantities of mutant                   proteins derived by site-directed mutagenesis.  The photoelectronic             properties of these light sensitive proteins will be assessed by                investigators with expertise in three different areas: genetics,                photochemistry, and physics.
