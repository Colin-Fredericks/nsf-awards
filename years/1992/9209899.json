 "awd_abstract_narration": "The formation of highly crosslinked polymers from                               multifunctional monomers is typically accompanied by                            heterogeneity of the polymer structure, autoacceleration and                                                                                                    autodeceleration of the reaction kinetics, formation of a                       glassy polymer, a delay in volume shrinkage with respect of                                                                                                     equilibrium, and the attainment of a maximum functional group                                                                                                   conversion.  Polymers of multifunctional monomers afford a                      number of advantages in that they form a highly crosslinked                                                                                                     polymer with high mechanical and thermal integrity as well as                                                                                                   low solvent (i.e. moisture) absorption.  Many of these                          materials are also transparent to light over a large                            wavelength range.  These polymer properties make these                          materials desirable for applications as optical fiber coating,                                                                                                  laser video disc coatings, aspherical lenses, dental                            materials, printing inks, and nonlinear optical materials.                                                                                                      This work addresses, from both a theoretical and an                             experimental basis, the relationship between cure conditions                                                                                                    such as temperature, monomer functionality and type, and                        initiation rate and type to the final properties of the                         polymer after curing.  Because the polymer behavior is                          strongly dependent on the polymer structure and properties,                                                                                                     models will be developed to provide a framework, applicable to                                                                                                  curing processes involving chain polymerization.  This                          framework will predict the effect of reaction conditions such                                                                                                   as temperature, initiation rate and type, and monomer                           characteristics and functionality on the reaction and on the                                                                                                    polymer structure and properties.  Current models coupling the                                                                                                  volume relaxation and reaction kinetics will be modified to                                                                                                     predict temperature dependence, depolymerization, ionic                         polymerizations, and termination by reaction diffusion.  A                      kinetic gelation simulation will be developed and used to                       predict the polymer structure including the molecular weight                                                                                                    distribution, the gel point conversion, the cyclization                         tendency, and the heterogeneity as a function of the reaction                                                                                                   conditions.  Finally, experimental characterization of the                      reaction progress and the polymer structure will be done using                                                                                                  free radical polymerizations of multi(meth)acrylates initiated                                                                                                  both thermally and by ultraviolet radiation.  In this way the                                                                                                   models will be verified.",
