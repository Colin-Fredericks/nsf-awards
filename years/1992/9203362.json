 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on differential equations and                        differential geometry.  The research involves the study of                      manifolds without conjugate points, sharp isoperimetric                         inequalities for manifolds of various dimensions, degenerate                    systems of partial differential equations (especially equations of              prescribed curvature, the geometry of isospectral manifolds,                    certain classes of minimal submanifolds, and certain applications               of geometry to physiology.                                                           In general, this research concerns mathematical models of the              Riemannian geometry of manifolds.  Some of this research has                    application to physiology; for example, the traditional treatment               of gallstones is cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder).                  However, lithotripsy (fragmentation) and dissolution of gallstones              has been advanced as an alternative in recent years.  The                       investigators on this award are involved in developing a                        sophisticated mathematical model which predicts the behavior of                 fragments in solvent over time.  The model predicts the evolution               of the stone/solvent interface and is a modification of the                     curvature flow in differential geometry studied by many                         researchers.",
