 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                       metallic Chemistry Program, Professor Theopold will continue                    his studies of chromium alkyl complex chemistry.  In this grant                 period the focus will be on Cp*Cr(III), Cp*Cr(II) and Cp*Cr-oxo                 alkyl complexes, and on some novel Cp*Cr-oxo-M cluster                          compounds (Cp* is the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl group).                       Examples of Cp*Cr-oxo alkyl complexes in the formal IV, V and                   VI oxidation states have already been discovered.  Although one                 objective of the research is the synthesis and structural                       characterization of new examples of the above compounds, the                    primary thrust of the work is to define the reactivity patterns                 of these classes of compounds.  Of special interest is their                    activity as new polymerization catalysts and as models for the                  known heterogeneous chromium oxide/aluminum alkyl based                         industrial olefin polymerization catalysts.  Because most of                    the compounds to be considered are paramagnetic, their                          characterization must rely on elemental analysis, reaction                      product analysis and x-ray structure determinations on suitably                 crystalline materials.                                                          %%%                                                                             This project will explore the fundamental chemistry of                          organometallic compounds that contain unpaired electrons.  As                   such, they have very different properties from the vast                         majority of known organometallic compounds.  Because they are                   much harder to characterize with respect to structure, the                      chemistry of these novel compounds is not well known.  It is                    believed that they may be related to current industrial                         catalysts that are used for production of polyolefins which are                 used in many household consumer products.  This research may                    lead to even better catalysts for the production of these                       materials.",
