 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genes governing allorecognition in both vertebrates and                     invertebrates can be highly polymorphic.  This project will examine             some of the selective forces that may have initiated and maintained             this polymorphism in a model system, the colonial ascidian,                     Botryllus schlosseri.  In this ascidian, a single and highly                    polymorphic allorecognition locus appears to govern the processes               of colony fusion and gamete incompatibility.  It is argued that a               precise allorecognition system may have evolved in B. Schlosseri to             reduce the costs of somatic cell parasitism associated with colony              fusion and/or to decrease the level of inbreeding over that                     expected if male fertilities were a simple function of sperm                    concentration.  This project will test these ideas by asking the                following specific questions:  1) What are the genetic costs of                 colony fusion?  2) What is the frequency of genetic chimeras in                 natural populations? and 3) To what extent does gametic                         incompatibility lower male fertilities in matings among kin?                                                                                                    To answer these questions the research will: first,  determine the              best combination of probes and restriction enzymes for the genetic              typing of individuals by DNA fingerprinting; second, genetically                characterize what happens to the tissues and germ lines of fused                colonies over time; third, genetically type the tissues and progeny             of a random sample of colonies to determine what percentage of a                local population consists of genetic chimeras; and fourth, the                  project will use sperm competition experiments and paternity                    fertilization success in matings among kin.                                                                                                                     This project will provide two products.  The first product will be              a description of the genetic consequences of histocompatibility.                Such information will be critical to our understanding of the                   adaptive significance of colony fusion and gamete incompatibility               in communities of clonal marine invertebrates as well as for                    identifying the selective forces that initiated and maintained the              high levels of allotypic polymorphism that are necessary for a                  precise allorecognition system.  The second product will be the                 development of molecular techniques for the estimation of                       paternity.  In the future, this capability will allow for more                  detailed genetic studies that attempt to reconstruct the genealogy              of populations and assess the evolutionary fitness of different                 genotypes.",
