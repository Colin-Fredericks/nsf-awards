Problems studied will include the time-dependent                Schrodinger equation,  the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and a                     (simplified) global spectral model from meteorology.  The                       Schrodinger equation ap\u0131ears in various application areas such as               computational chemistry, atomic physics molecular dynamics, and                 also in certain approaches to modeling acoustic propagation in                  the ocean and in optics.                                                                                                                                        The families of numerical methods to be considered include                      operator splitting methods (e.g. ADI), multigrid, spectral                      methods, cyclic reduction and Pade-based like preconditioned                    Krylov subspace methods will be included.  In this project, the                 PI will build upon past experience with the Intel hypercubes, the               Connection Machine, multiprocessor Crays and the Alliant, to                    develop and implement parallel methods for the new generation of                parallel supercomputers, such as the CM5 and the Intel Touchstone               machines.  This research will shed light on what numerical                      methods are appropriate for high performance parallel                           architectures.",
