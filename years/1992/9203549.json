 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sonny Lee has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in                     Chemistry. Dr. Lee's doctoral degree was from Harvard under the                 supervision of Professor Richard Holm. Dr. Lee intends to                       continue research at the California Institute of Technology                     with Professor Harry Gray where he intends to study                             photoinitiated electron transfer. This will also expose him to                  techniques of molecular biology such as site directed                           mutagenesis, and protein purification and handling. This                        experience will prepare him for his long term goals of studying                 the coupling of electron transfer to chemically active sites in                 biological systems.                                                             %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                    knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into                   meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
