 "awd_abstract_narration": "Game theory and dynamic macroeconomic models typically assume that              people are \"ultra-rational,\" both in the sense that they know much              about the environment and their competitors' behavior, and in the               sense that they know how to use that information in the best                    possible way.  This project aims to weaken the assumption that                  people are fully rational, and to explore what happens when people              behave 'adaptively.'  Recent results from the literature on                     artificial intelligence will be used to build a class of adaptive               learning schemes that are suitable for studying economic models.                These learning schemes will be applied in several economic                      contexts.  For example, the \"coordination failure problems\" will                be analyzed, that is, how much coordination can eventually be                   expected from a system of agents, each of whom behaves adaptively.              Several applications in game theory and macroeconomics will also                be studied.  In some settings, the established learning theories                will be used as devices to select among alternative equilibria.                 In other settings, the theories will be used to suggest self-                   confirming patterns of behavior that correspond to alternative                  notions of equilibria.  Finally, relationships among some existing              and new notions of stability, complexity and optimality will also               be investigated.",
