 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kupiainen will continue his investigations of the                          statistical mechanics of disordered systems.  The purpose of this               program is to develop exact renormalization group methods to the                study of a wide variety of such systems.  These include classical               systems of the Lorentz gas type and lattice  versions thereof as                well as diffusion in quantum systems.  He will also continue his                research in conformal field theory, centered around the WZW                     model.                                                                               Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                     product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                  last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                  and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                 electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                        foundations for these developments, collectively called                         mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                          Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,                to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                 forces into a single theory.",
