Summer Science Camp is a six week commuter                           mathematics and science program along with a follow-up academic                 year program.  The program serves two hundred and twenty-five                   seventh through ninth grade African-American, Hispanic                          and Native-American students over a three year period.  The objectives          of the program are to:  1) introduce students to science, engineering           and mathematics concepts in a culturally relevant manner; 2) teach              students how academic coursework relates to their futures; 3) show              students how science, engineering and math relates to the world                 around them; and 4) help parents become better informed and actively            involved in the education of their children.  The program involves              volunteer scientists and engineers from local industry and San                  Francisco State University.  Program activities include: science,               computer science, mathematics and communications courses, guests                speakers, laboratory demonstrations/experiments, field trips and group          research projects.  During the academic year students participate in            the existing MESA Program at their school site.",
