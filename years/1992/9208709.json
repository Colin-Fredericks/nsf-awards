 "awd_abstract_narration": "This field project will investigate an unusual type of                          synchronous flashing in Southeast Asian fireflies.  The Borneo                  \"silent counter,\" a firefly that flashes continuously, pauses,                  and then flashes continuously again, will be studied using                      innovative modern technologies.  Dr. Copeland and his colleagues                will attempt to demonstrate unequivocally that this firefly is a                synchronizer and will focus on the activity of the pacemaker                    oscillator during the dark (\"silent\") period.  The oscillator-                  like flash behavior of three other closely related species will                 also be studied, including two continuously synchronic (no pause)               fireflies and a non-synchronic firefly.  Since all four species                 look alike and have been classified as Pteroptyx malaccae, some                 of the fireflies whose flashes have been recorded will be                       preserved so that their DNA can later be subjected to                           restriction-enzyme analysis, to provide a biochemical taxonomic                 identifier for the behavioral and morphological key to this                     complex of fireflies.                                                                                                                                           Synchronously flashing fireflies live in the fragile tropical                   environment of Southeast Asia.  Logging and industrial                          development are rapidly destroying the habitat of this unique                   type of animal.  This research, then, will document an unusual                  variety of synchronic behavior in fireflies before it becomes                   extinct.  Further, it is important to understand the mechanisms                 underlying synchrony because synchrony occurs in so few                         organisms.  Other than fireflies, synchronous behavior has been                 demonstrated only in crickets and humans.  Thus, this research                  could yield insights into the human ability to perform in                       rhythmic unison.  In addition, the modern technologies used in                  this study will provide, for the first time, quantitative data on               synchronous flashing on the same time scale as neurophysiological               data that will be obtained in future studies.  Thus, this project               is valuable as a guide for future neurophysiological studies with               implications for human biology.  Finally, combining this                        behavioral study with morphological and DNA studies will clarify                the taxonomy of these organisms and, thus, how to preserve them                 better as their natural habitat shrinks.",
