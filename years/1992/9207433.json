 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER).  A novel                 technique involving the initiation of cationic polymerization using             metal ions is being explored.  In the experiment, Al+ or Cu+ ions               are generated in the gas phase by pulsed laser                                  vaporization/ionization of a metal target using the second harmonic             of a Nd:YAG laser (532 nm).  The ions are pulled toward a monomer               liquid (isobutylene which can only be polymerized by cationic                   mechanisms) by applying appropriate electric fields across the                  reaction chamber.  Under different experimental conditions                      (temperature, pressure of a carrier gas, laser energy, electric                 field strength, reaction time) different polymeric products                     (viscous liquids or solids) were obtained with average molecular                weights ranging from 285 to greater than 40,000.  Full                          characterization of these materials is currently in progress.                   Experiments are in progress to extend the scope of this discovery               to include transition-metal ions, mixed metal ions,                             copolymerization, etc.  This technique could lead to a powerful                 approach for the synthesis of a wide variety of polymeric materials             with unique properties such as stability, strength, and                         photo/electrical conductivity.",
