 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research                  project between Professors John Wefel and Michael Cherry,                       Department of Physics and Astronomy, Louisiana State University,                and Professor Takeshi Ogata, Institute for Cosmic Ray Research,                 University of Tokyo.  It is part of the Japanese-American                       Cooperative Emulsion Experiment (JACEE), which began in 1978                    to investigate the physics of high energy nucleus-nucleus                       interactions at energies above those available at accelerators and for          studying the nuclear composion of primary cosmic rays extending                 up to the extensive air shower (EAS) region.  The JACEE                         Collaboration involves four institutions in the United States and               eight in Japan.                                                                                                                                                 Japan produces the world's highest quality nuclear emulsion and                 Japanese researchers pioneered the use of emulsion chambers.                    Scientists in the United States have developed the technology for               high altitude balloon flights, including the newest Long Duration               Ballooning (LDB) capability.  Laboratories in both countries are                well equipped to carry out detailed microscope measurements                     involved in analyzing particle events in emulsion chambers.  This               grant will permit the U.S. investigators to travel to collaborating             institutions in Japan.  Contributing to this grant is the NSF                   Division of Physics, which will support shipping costs and the costs            of travel of the investigators to the site of balloon flights in                Australia.",
