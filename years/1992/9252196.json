 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Grinnell College Physics Department is redesigning the                      introductory physics laboratory in order to incorporate new                     teaching methods and new technology.  The most conspicuous                      change is the introduction of microcomputers for data                           acquisition and analysis.  The computers are equipped with                      versatile data acquisition hardware and software, as well as                    with graphing software, to permit the same instrumental                         configuration to be easily adapted to a wide variety of                         experimental situations with minimal software development                       effort.  The computers perform the more repetitive and non-                     educational tasks, leaving the decisionmaking and intellectual                  processing to the students.  The use of computers in the lab                    has several educational benefits:  1) experiments for which                     data must be taken rapidly become possible; 2) experiments                      which involve a great deal of repetitive analysis require less                  time between performing the experiment and seeing the result,                   increasing the impact on the student; 3) students are able to                   see both their own results and the class average, allowing them                 to see the effects of experimental uncertainties; 4)                            experiments can be designed to be more flexible, allowing                       greater accommodation to the different abilities and interests                  of the students; 5) new or revised experiments can be made                      available more easily; and 6) students are gaining some                         experience with the use of computers for data acquisition and                   analysis.  These changes result in a laboratory experience                      which is better suited to the needs of our students, who are                    then able to concentrate more on understanding the physics and                  less on the mechanical handling of the data.",
