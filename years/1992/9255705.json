 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant seeks to develop a proposal for the                         enhancement of teachers in the life sciences and health in                      Prince Georges County, Maryland.  The overall objective of                      the proposal is to improve the quality of science                               instruction in grades 4-8 by forming a partnership between                      the school system, Howard University professionals and                          community based scientific and technological personnel.                         During the twelve months planning period the proposal                           working sessions will be arranged to assess science teachers                    needs in the County, formulate proper evaluation, plan the                      kinds of instruction teachers want and need at the                              university level and training in mentorship.  During the                        planning period the proposal will seek clear commitment from                    the county school system in the planning of the partnership                     to train a corps of mentor teachers and will use classroom                      teachers in planning project activities in science along                        with community based institutions.                                                                                                                              An outcome of the planning period will be the design of a                       proposal that will have the following objectives:  The                          development of a program to broaden and strengthen                              pedagogical and technological knowledge to science teachers;                    the development of hands-on laboratory experiences for                          teachers and make provisions for these experiences to be                        translated to classroom activities; and the development of a                    strong partnership formation between the school system,                         Howard University and community based scientific and                            technological personnel.",
