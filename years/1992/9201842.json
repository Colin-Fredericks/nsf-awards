The program's awards                    provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique                 or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental                         conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                              This award will support a three-month postdoctoral research visit               by Dr. Michael Pazzani of the University of California, Irvine to               work with Dr. J. Ross Quinlan of the University of Sydney.                      Dr. Pazzani will collaborate with Dr. Quinlan on the following                  topics involving information-based approaches to relational                     concept learning:                                                                                                                                               A.  Investigating approaches to dealing with noise in training                  data.  He will investigate refinements of a Minimum Description                 Length approach, as well as alternative approaches to dealing                   with noisy training data.  One alternative that will be explored                is the technique of averaging multiple models.                                                                                                                  B.  Applying relational concept learning to larger problems on                  naturally occurring data sets, identifying additional research                  issues, and examining how well the complexity analysis in Pazzani               & Kibler (in press) predicts how the learning methods will scale                to larger problems.
