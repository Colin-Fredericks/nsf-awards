 "awd_abstract_narration": "This infrastructure award is for the development of a                      visualization and machine learning laboratory.  The laboratory                  consists of powerful graphics workstations, a parallel processor,               a large file server, a fiber optics high speed data network,                    and support personnel to maintain the laboratory.  The research                 supported by this equipment includes:  statistical data analysis,               pattern recognition, and machine learning; visualization of                     sample volume data; interactive steering of simulations; high                   speed switching;concurrent systems; and applications of                         electronic libraries.                                                                                                                                                A major bottleneck to the utilization of scientific                        information is the massive amount of data now collected.                        Scientific visualization is the term that covers an emerging                    collection of new techniques for transforming multidimensional                  numeric data into understandable graphic images.  These images                  can then be manipulated and explored by scientists and engineers                who, sitting at their workstations, create models and draw                      inferences from them. Machine learning includes a wide variety of               techniques from the fields of pattern recognition, signal                       processing, statistical decision and control theory, and                        artificial intelligence that allow the machine itself to                        participate in the process of creating models and drawing                       inferences from data.  It is anticipated that a new synergy                     between machine learning and scientific visualization will arise                from this award and that substantial collaborations with                        scientists outside of the computer science department will occur.",
