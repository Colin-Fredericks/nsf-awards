 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to undertake a comprehensive                  study of the ways in which properties of single sinus and atrial                cardiac cells such as voltage-dependent membrane currents, ion                  pumping mechanisms, calcium buffering and release systems, and                  inter-cellular gap junction conductance, influence the generation               and propagation of electrical activity in models of the sinus                   node, atrium, and combined sinus node - atrial networks.  Cell                  models will be based on whole-cell voltage-clamp data obtained                  from sinus and atrial cells isolated from rabbit heart.  Networks               will be modeled as two-dimensional lattices, with neighboring                   cells interconnected by resistors representing gap junctions.                   Network stat equations will be integrated on a massively parallel               supercomputer, the Connection Machine CM-2, in order to                         facilitate simulation of very large systems of cells.  The models               will be used to study the mechanisms which influence the                        generation and propagation of pacemaker activity in normal                      cardiac tissue.  Mechanisms giving rise to arrhythmias in                       localized groups of cells, and factors affecting the propagation                of arrhythmic activity through model networks will also be                      investigated.                                                                                                                                                   The proposed research will enhance our basic understanding of                   both normal and abnormal cardiac dynamics, and is unique in that                it represents an attempt to understand the \"macroscopic\"                        properties of large networks of cardiac cells give detailed                     descriptions of the \"microscopic\" behavior of individual cells.",
