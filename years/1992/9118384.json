 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have cloned a positive regulatory locus, designated lemA, that               is required for two diverse aspects of plant disease: lesion                    formation by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae on beam and the                  production of the phytotoxins tabtoxin and sytringomycin by several             Pseudomonas syringae strains.  In P. syringae pv. syringae, a                   functional lemA gene is required for lesion formation and for the               production of syringomycin and protease.  The lemA analog within P.             syringae pv. coronafaciens is required for tabtoxin production but              not lesion formation by this pathovar.  Analysis of the sequence of             this gene reveals extensive amino acid similarity of the predicted              LemA protein to a family of transmembrane transcription regulators.             In addition, northern blot analysis has shown that a transcript                 from the tblA gene within the tabtoxin biosynthetic region is                   absent in derivatives of P. syringae pv. coronafaciens containing               a lemA mutation.  It appears, therefore, that the lemA gene                     functions as a positive transcriptional regulator of genes involved             in lesion formation and toxin production in P. syringae.  It is the             goal of this proposal to purify the enzyme encoded by the lemA gene             to test whether, as predicted by sequence comparisons, it is a                  plasma membrane proteins with an extracellular receptor domain and              a cytoplasmic protein-phosphylating domain.  We will use DNA                    fragments from the promoter region of the tblA gene to test the                 potential for DNA binding by the LemA protein.  Using random Tn5lac             insertions into a P. syringae pv. syringae mutant containing a                  temperature-sensitive lemA mutation, we will identify lemA-                     regulated genes in P. syringae pv. syringae.  We have identified an             additional Tn5 mutation of P. syringae pv. syringae that does not               map to the lemA locus but which also eliminates lesion formation.               We will characterize this gene by DNA sequence analysis and examine             its potential regulatory linkage to lemA.                                       %%%                                                                             The plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae has become a model system               for understanding how bacteria cause plant disease.  These studies              focus on a particular genetics locus, lemA, which is required for               two aspects of the disease process-lesion formation and toxin                   production.  The mechanism by which a single protein controls two               disease processes will be probed.",
