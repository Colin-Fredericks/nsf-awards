 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software modules are being developed which will improve student                 learning in undergraduate major and service statistics courses.                  With these modules,  students can use modern commercial                        statistical software and computing equipment to analyze                         realistic data.  The data analysis assignments will enable                      students to master the mechanics of data analysis and the                       important concepts that are introduced in these courses.  This                  is particularly so for concepts that require visualizing in                     more than two or three dimensions (e.g., multiple regression                    surfaces) or that require theory beyond the mathematical                        abilities of the students (e.g., large-sample approximate                       sampling distributions).  By using modern computing technology,                 the students will become more actively involved in the learning                 of important statistical concepts.  The learning experience can                 be enhanced by giving students additional statistical                           experiences by using combinations of carefully designed and                     implemented multiple simulations and high-resolution dynamic                    graphics to illustrate key ideas.",
