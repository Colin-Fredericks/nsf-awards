 "awd_abstract_narration": "Triton College is developing a computer-integrated engineering                  classroom.  The computers will be used primarily for the                        teaching of three mechanics courses:  Statics, Dynamics, and                    Strength of Materials.  The software used will include software                 written and tested at the College as well as commercially                       available software including symbolic manipulasators and                        special purpose structural analysis programs. The classroom                     will initially be equipped with 12 computers, with two students                 per computer.The computers will be used during class time to                    allow the faculty to improve visualization skills as well as to                 allow students to solve problems which require the variation of                 several parameters.  Students will be assigned traditional                      homework problems as well as projects which will entail the use                 of computers. Evaluation of the project will be performed via                   a test data bank, which was developed with a previous NSF                       grant.",
