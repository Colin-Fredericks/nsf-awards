 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is becoming more common for biologists to collect multiple                   choices of the same gene from a population, and to get the exact                DNA sequence for each.  By looking at the differences that have                 occurred between the sequences, an idea how long ago they diverged              from each other can be ascertained.  When DNA sequences are                     collected for a single gene in a single population, they will be                closer relatives the smaller the population size has been small.                More similar DNA sequences are expected if the population size has              been small.  This project investigates the statistical methods for              using these DNA differences to estimate the size of the population.             The more complicated case of many populations will also be                      investigated and the ranges of migration of genes among populations             estimated.  Ultimately this will allow consideration of the times               back to the common ancestors of all modern humans and a formulation             of a picture of how small population sizes of the human species                 were hundreds of thousands of years ago.  To calculate the                      quantities that are needed for these estimates, the different ways              that the DNA sequences in our sample could be related to each other             must be calculated.  Computers are used to randomly sample a large              number of possible genealogies.  This is a promising method of                  exploring the statistical meaning of population samples of DNA                  sequences.  In this way, population sizes, migration rates, and                 similar genetic parameters can be estimated without making                      unrealistic assumptions.  The computer programs developed will be               freely distributed as part of the PHYLIP package of computer                    programs for reconstructing phylogenies.",
