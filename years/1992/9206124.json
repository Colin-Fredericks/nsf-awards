 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flash floods are major meteorological disasters which occur                around the globe.  Understanding of this phenomenon is a                        challenging problem because it is necessary to understand both                  complex dynamic and microphysical processes at scales of motion                 that are smaller than typically measured by conventional weather                networks.  This scale of motion is termed storm-scale or mesoscale              by meteorologists.                                                                                                                                                   The National Science Council of Taiwan established a Multiple              Hazards Mitigation Project whose meteorological component focused               on improving flash flood predictions.  A major field project,                   entitled the Taiwan Area Mesoscale Experiement (TAMEX), was held in             the Spring of 1987.  The project was a joint effort of various                  Taiwanese agencies with participation from the National Oceanic and             Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation                  (NSF).  The scientific goals were to study the mesoscale systems                that form on a quasi-stationary and consistent feature known as the             Mei-Yu front and cause the heavy rains known as the \"plum rains\".                                                                                                    Under a previous award, the Principal Investigator used the                special observations collected during the TAMEX in diagnostic                   studies that identified important factors for the formation of                  heavy rainfall.  These studies have lead the Principal Investigator             to concentrate on three topics -- the dynamics of the low level                 jet; the barrier jet which forms along the northwest windward coast             of Taiwan under the prevailing southwesterlies; and the upper-level             circulations.  In addition to further analysis using the                        observational data, the Principal Investigator will utilize a                   numerical model to help identify the important dynamic factors for              heavy rain production.",
