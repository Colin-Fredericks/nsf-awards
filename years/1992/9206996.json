 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long range goal of this project is to understand the                      mechanism of surface translocation, or gliding, in myxobacteria.                The survival of a diverse group of environmentally important                    organisms, including myxobacteria, cytophaga, cyanobacteria, and                Beggiotoa, depends upon their ability to glide.  In this project,               Myxococcus xanthus will be used as a model to understand gliding                because it is genetically well-characterized.  One gene, mglA, is               essential for gliding; the focus of this project will be on how                 MglA protein interacts with other motility components.  Since mglA              is the only gene common to the two known genetically-identified                 systems, A and S, that control gliding, MglA protein may affect                 expression of A- and S-gliding genes.  The first aim will therefore             be to isolate and characterize reporter gene (lacZ) insertions in               A- and S-motility genes and determine if their transcription is                 altered in an mgl- strain.  Another goal will be to use mutagenesis             to probe the functional domains of MglA by identifying mglA mutants             that show aberrant gliding.  Suppressor experiments have also been              designed to identify genes encoding proteins that interact with                 MglA.  One mutant has already been identified that suppresses the               mglA defect, and the corresponding gene will be cloned to determine             if it encodes a gliding protein that interacts with MglA.                       %%%                                                                             Bacteria need to be able to move from one place to another in order             to survive.  One of the most intriguing, and least understood,                  mechanisms of bacterial motility is the phenomenon of gliding on                solid substrata.  The field is complicated by the likelihood that               the gliding mechanisms employed by one group of gliding bacteria                may not be the same as those employed by other groups.  In                      myxobacteria, gliding is crucial not only to enable the bacteria to             find food, but also to enable the bacteria to undergo a                         developmental transition from the vegetative gliding bacterium form             to a sporogenic \"fruiting body.\"  There are two almost independent              motility systems, termed \"A\" (\"adventurous\") and \"S\" (\"social\").                S-motility requires cell-to-cell proximity for movement to occur,               and is known to involve at least 12 distinct genes.  A-motility                 does not require cell-cell contact, and is controlled by at least               22 genes.  Wild-type myxococci exhibit both A+ and S+ motility.  A              mutation in one of the A or S genes abolishes only the A or S type              of motility.  Both of these mechanisms seem to involve regulation               of the same basic motility machinery.  In addition, there are other             genes, termed \"frz\" genes, which affect the rate at which cells                 reverse direction while gliding.  However, there is a single                    genetic locus, mglA, for which a mutation abolishes both A and S                type motility, resulting in totally nonmotile bacteria.  The                    proposed studies of this pivotal gene are likely to shed new light              on the mechanism of gliding in myxococci.",
