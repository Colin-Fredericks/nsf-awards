 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with recovery of proteins from                       complex biological media (microbial cell broths, tissue                         homogenates, mammalian cell culture broths, etc.) by affinity                   precipitation using ligand-modified phospholipids (LMP).                        Ligand modified phospholipids are phospholipids to which is                     covalently attached a ligand which selectively complexes to a                   site on a protein molecule.  Ligand modified phospholipids are                  solubilized in water by hydrophobic association with nonionic                   surfactants.  The solubilized LMP/surfactant complex then                       binds with the active site on the protein to form a protein-                    phospholipid-surfactant complex.  Such complexes aggregate by                   virtue of hydrophobic interactions among hydrocarbon chains on                  different complexes.  Also another LMB/surfactant complex can                   bind to the protein of a LMB/surfactant/protein complex if                      there is more than one binding site on the protein.                             Associations of these types lead to large complexes which                       become insoluble and precipitate out of solution.                                                                                                               In a previous grant (CTS-8904192), the PIs demonstrated that                    this precipitation does work by using DMPE-biotin as the                        ligand modified phospholipid and avidin (with four binding                      sites to biotin) as the protein.  To solubilized the LMP, the                   polyethoxy surfactant C12E8 was added in concentrations above                   the CMC.  The phospholipid solubilized itself into the                          micelles as was inferred by changes in micellar size as                         measured by quasi-elastic light scattering.  When the ligand                    modified phospholipid was attached to the micelles,                             precipitation was not observed; however, when the solution was                  diluted to presumably form sub-micelle aggregates in a                          metastable, transparent solution, precipitation of the avidin                   was observed.  A theory for the rate of aggregate formation                     was developing using Smoluchowski kinetics.  Measurements of                    the turbidity due to scattering were shown to be in good                        agreement with the kinetic expressions.  The new research                       suggests examining the precipitation by this method of two                      polyclonal (goat IgG) antibodies with two binding sites, anti-                  biotin antibody (ABA) and anti-digoxin antibody (ADA), and a                    single binding site enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK).  The                      synthesis routes for the LMPs are detailed.  In the new                         effort, the effects of impurity proteins on the affinity                        precipitation will be examined, and isolation schemes to                        remove the protein from the precipitating aggregate will be                     devised and tested.",
