 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using modern technologies such as determination of chromosome                   numbers, electrophoresis of enzyme variants, and scanning electron              microscopy of minute morphological features, it has been possible               to explicate patterns of hybrid speciation in ferns quite                       accurately.  We know comparatively little, however, about the                   ancestry of the basic, non-hybrid-derived species.  By studying                 members of the Polypodium vulgare complex, a group of about twelve              species of temperate ferns, the proposed research will develop and              test hypotheses about the systematics of basic diploid species.                 Comprehensive data bases will be accumulated on morphological                   features, biogeography, chromosome constitution, enzyme                         variability, and chloroplast DNA mutations.  These data bases will              provide the basis for a detailed exploration of the relationships               among these species and should enable the analysis of Polypodium                species to be extended into the tropical ecosystems.  Through these             studies we should gain insights on how the diversity in this                    relatively unexplored part of the world has contributed to the                  origin of our temperate flora.                                                  Thus, with the completion of the proposed research, we should have              a modern synthesis of information on the primary and secondary                  speciation pathways in temperate Polypodium.  By applying this                  model, modes and mechanisms that characterize patterns of diversity             may be generalized for understanding the systematics of fern                    species and perhaps for a variety of other temperate plant groups.",
