 "awd_abstract_narration": "People who occupy positions of power are held in higher esteem             that they otherwise would be.  This elevation in status can be                  reduced if the social advantages responsible for a given                        individual's power are known.  This doctoral dissertation project               is an experimental study that will integrate theoretical concepts               from three theories in sociology--exchange, expectation states, and             status value--in an effort to explain why power confers status and              why it confers more status in some situations than in others.  One              hundred and fifty participants will take part in an experiment                  designed to examine the effect of differences in power which                    produce a difference in rewards in the presence or, alternatively,              in the absence of information about the social structural power                 that produces that difference in rewards.                                                                                                                            This project will contribute to the fields of sociology and                social psychology by increasing our understanding of the connection             of power to status.  In addition, it will increase our                          understanding of the motive for restricting information in                      organizations that in turn could lead to techniques for increasing              the flow of information.  This project also will provide an                     excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to              develop independent research skills.",
