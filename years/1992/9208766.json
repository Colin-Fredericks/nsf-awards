 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray measurements provide non-destructive structural information               for many materials systems.  High resolution diffraction                        measurements determine sample perfection, compositional and strain              modulation, and interface abruptness over a few atomic planes.  X-              ray reflectivity measurements address electron density modulations              and interface roughness in thin film systems.  Such issues are                  highly relevant to the growth and processing of semiconductor                   epitaxial heterostructures, device structures, and bulk materials.              Physical information, including the effect of strain and materials              perfection on optical and electronic properties, are also                       quantitatively determined.  In other fields, these techniques                   enhance the study of coherency strains in superalloys and of                    ceramic thin films deposited by sol-gel methods.  In this project,              we will develop a high resolution x-ray diffraction/scattering                  characterization facility with both high and low temperature                    stages.  The facility shall include wafer mapping capabilities and              simulation software.  Major research proposals involving Si1icon-               germanium multi-layers and device structures, the growth kinetics               and structural properties of HgCdTe, the relationship between                   strain and optical and transport properties in III-V multi-layers,              and misfit strain in precipitation hardened superalloys are                     presented.",
