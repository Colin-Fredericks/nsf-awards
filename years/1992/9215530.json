 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biotic interactions of sessile colonial invertebrates are often                 mediated by inducible structures that are locally deployed on the               colony. In no other group of animals is there likely to be such a               tight relationship between the function of ecological interaction               and underlying physiological constraints. Colonies of                           the marine bryozoan, Membranipora membranacea, specifically change              morphology with changes in the biotic environment: spines are                   induced by predators, and stolons by some conspecifics. Previous                work has shown that the spines exact a fitness cost and this                    project will test the hypothesis that the mechanism underlying the              cost is disruption of colony-wide translocation and metabolic                   patterns.  Although inducible defenses are common in marine,                    terrestrial, and freshwater organisms, and costs have been                      frequently demonstrated, no studies have elucidated mechanisms                  underlying costs of defense.  The current hypothesis of this                    project is based on the concept of a simple source-sink model                   controlling the basic process of translocation in bryozoan colonies             and linking physiological function with ecological performance.                 This project will attempt to develop radioisotope methods using                 14Carbon and 35Sulfur to test the hypothesis.",
