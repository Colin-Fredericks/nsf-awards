This exhibit, titled \"Burstbusters Taming Weather                      Hazards to Aviation,\" will describe how the hazardous weather                   phenomena were identifies, how technology was utilized to create                a system to detect and predict them, and how the new system will                operate at airports to enhance safety and air traffic                           efficiency.  large groups of the population not routinely                       exposed to science issues will be presented with this case study                as an example of how public science funding can directly affect                 their lives.  The exhibit will capitalize on this linkage to                    increase public literacy about the science and technology                       processes and to promote parental advocacy of science education                 for their children.                                                                                                                                             Two copies of the exhibit will travel to approximately 20                       airport terminals and science museums from June 1993 through                    September 1995.//",
