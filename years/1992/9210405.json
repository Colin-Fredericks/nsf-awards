 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vast majority of theoretical economic models impose very                    strong hypotheses as to the rationality of agents.  In                          macroeconomic contexts, the standard assumption is that agents                  are fully aware of the equilibrium distributions of endogenous                  variables, i.e., rational expectations prevails.  Models in which               strategic interactions are important typically impose some                      strengthened form of Nash equilibrium, in which agents know with                complete accuracy the decision plans of their rivals.  These                    hypotheses, although central to the economic predictions of the                 models, can be criticized on the grounds that they give no                      account of how the agents acquire such information.  Recent                     research posits that agents engage in passive adaptive learning.                For example, the least squares learning approach presumes that                  the adaptive rule takes the form of a least squares regression,                 and evolutionary adaptation schemes specific that agents adjust                 their actions based on the relative fitness of competing                        strategies.  This project seeks to develop a middle ground                      between the opposing extremes of full rationality and passive                   adaptation.  The overriding goal is to establish a general                      framework for analyzing expectation formation behavior that                     allows agents to engage in a process of active cognition with                   respect to the economic environment, but places inherent                        limitations on their cognitive abilities in terms of restrictions               on the calculation technology.                                                                                                                                  This project develops an approach to bounded rationality  in                    which agents are endowed with a technology for calculating                      expectations, together with preferences over forecast errors.                   Agents form expectations by balancing the benefits of imp;roved                 forecasts against the costs of calculation.  This project extends               previous work by the investigators to incorporate a much richer                 variety of economic environments and calculation algorithms.  The               approach is used to study hyperinflation and to explain puzzling                experimental finding by Marimon and Sunder that are difficult to                reconcile with either rational expectations or conventional                     passive adaptive learning approaches.  The calculation framework                is extended further and applied to problems in macroeconomics,                  finance and industrial organization.",
