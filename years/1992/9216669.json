 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation for, and subsequent design of                                  a high speed, high contrast, semiconductor                                      spatial light modulator (SLM) is proposed.                                      The SLM uses polarization rotation in a                                         MQW under built-in uniaxial stress.  The                                        ordinarily strained MQWs are pattern with                                       stripe forms to induce an anisotropy in the                                     absorption.  The MQW structures then are                                        sandwiched between two linear polarizers                                        similar to liquid crystal SLMs.  the \"on\" and                                   \"off\" states are controlled with an applied                                     voltage.  The contrast ratio, which is                                          determined by the quality of the polarizers,                                    can reach as high as 1000: 1; which the                                         modulation speed, which is determined by                                        electro-absorption in the heterostructures, can                                 reach the picosecond range.                                                                                                                                     The proposal represents a two-year                                              collaboration between the Department of                                         Electrical and Computer Engineering at                                          Rutgers University and the Electronics                                          Technology and Devices Laboratory (ETDL)                                        at Fort Monmouth.  The work at Rutgers will                                     focus on processing development, structural                                     characterization, and theoretical modeling.  In                                 addition, a graduate student from Rutgers will                                  spend and majority of her time at ETDL,                                         performing the optical studies for this project.                                The National Science Foundation's support                                       will greatly enhance our joint efforts in this                                  area.",
