 "awd_abstract_narration": "Convergent margin accretionary prisms are structurally complex                  geological features.  This is a proposal to conduct a walkaway                  Vertical Seismic Profile experiment at Oregon Margin site OM-3 to               image the structural features within 3km of the borehole both                   perpendicular and parallel to structural strike.  This should                   result in better definition of the frontal thrust and its associ-               ated amplitude anomalies as well as part of the protothrust zone.                                                                                               Because the VSP's will be acquired in the drill hole using                      surface seismic sources, they should provide a better tie to                    surface seismic data.  The walkaway VSP illumunates the zone                    below the borehole geophone, thereby imaging the structure below                and laterally away from the drill hole.  This lateral coverage                  will yield amplitude vs offset information, which will be used                  for inferring fluid contents of the frontal thrust and other                    layers that exhibit anomalous amplitudes.                                                                                                                       This award will support Dr. Moore's efforts to obtain Vertical                  Seismic Profiles (VSP) at the Oregon Margin drill site 3 (OM-3),                which will be drilled on ODP Leg 146.  This experiment will                     provide a more comprehensive three dimensional picture of the                   complex structural features of an accretionary prism within a                   three kilometer radius of the borehole. This will lead to a                     better understanding of the coupled structural and hydrogeologic                system within the prism. VSP's will also allow direct comparison                of seismic information to cored material and borehole logging                   data.",
