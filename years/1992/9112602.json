 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lizards of the genus Anolis are the most common and diverse                terrestrial vertebrates in the Caribbean.  Despite extensive                    knowledge about their ecology, behavior, and geographical                       distributions, little is known about levels of genetic variability              within and between populations of the many species, and of how                  these levels affect processes of speciation.  The morphologically               diverse species Anolis marmoratus, with 12 named subspecies in the              Guadeloupean archipelago of the Lesser Antilles, provides a test                case for exploring the relationship between mating systems, levels              of genetic variability, and speciation involving morphological                  change.  Variation in this species is particularly conspicuous in               color and pattern of adult males; characters that, along with                   signalling behavior, are important in social competition and mate               recognition.  Variation in these characters, leading to what is                 called assortative (that is, preferential) mating, will promote the             accumulation of genetic differences among populations, a postulated             first step leading to speciation (complete reproductive isolation).                  Faculty advisers David Wake and Harry Greene will supervise                graduate student Christopher Schneider in a study of genetic,                   behavioral, and morphological variation in this group of anolis                 lizards.  Emphasis is placed on nucleotide sequencing of select                 mitochondrial genes to acquire fine-scale evidence of variation                 and of gene flow between populations, within islands and between                islands.  The gene data will allow several tests of hypotheses                  concerning how male color patterns and display behaviors affect                 mating success, and thereby help structure local populations                    genetically.  In turn, knowledge about the genetic structure of                 local populations will help test ideas about speciation processes               in this diverse group of lizards.",
