Multidatabase                         interoperability and resolution of semantic heterogeneity                       constitute enabling technologies for the development of complex                 applications requiring access to multiple information resources.                The main objective is to bring together researchers from industry               and academia to discuss how the basic research addresses problems               encountered by applications in the heterogeneous database                       environment.  Participants have an opportunity to study real user               problems identified by the industry representatives.  The                       collaboration between basic and application researchers can then                be based on a solid foundation created by basic research. The                   main topics to be discussed include: semantic integration of                    information from diverse sources; methods to resolve semantic                   incompatibilities; query optimization techniques and distributed                transaction processing in multidatabase environments; descriptive               modeling of asynchronous data processing; and incorporation of                  emerging technologies (such as active and object-oriented                       databases) into multidatabase systems.  It is expected that the                 results of the workshop will be summarized in a final report to                 be published later.  The report will evaluate the progress made                 in multidatabase interoperability and identify areas in need of                 further research.",
