 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's             (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is               designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly             the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                 Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.               Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                   conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private                     venture capital or other non-federal financing.                                      This Phase I project is researching a novel frequency hopping              code division multiple access (FH/CDMA) personal communications                 network.  This mobile cellular communications system, designed to               maximize the number of users per cell, can operate in a frequency               band containing other users.  To maximize the number of users,                  synchronous FH/CDMA is being employed.  Forward error correction                and erasure detection and correction are being employed since                   interference can be detected.  Slow and fast hopping is being                   studied to optimize performance in a multipath environment.  Also,              standard hopping codes such as PN and Gold are being compared with              some new ideas on hop codes such as Reed-Solomon hopping patterns.",
