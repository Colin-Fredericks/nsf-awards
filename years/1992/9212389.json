 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Excimer Laser System will be purchased and used to support                   several established research programs in combustion chemistry,                  materials processing , and chemical analysis at George                          Washington University.  These programs include laser-solid                      interaction in synthetic diamond film formation, laser                          sampling of glass and ceramic targets for chemical analysis,                    laser production of radical species important in combustion                     processes, and photodissociation of chlorinated hydrocarbons.                   In the first two areas, the goal will be to follow changes                      occurring on the surface and within the bulk of the targets                     and to examine the properties of the generated plumes.                          Methods of investigation will include time-of-flight mass                       spectrometry, kinetic energy measurement of the ions produced,                  and analysis of particulates in the plumes.  In addition,                       laser-solid interactions will be examined theoretically for a                   broad range of lasers and selected materials.  In the third                     area, excimer laser photolysis will be used to prepare radical                  species which are important in combustion systems.  Absorption                  spectra for these species will then be obtained using an                        existing tunable diode laser spectrometer.  Use of excimer                      laser photolysis followed by IR absorption as a diagnostic for                  chlorinated hydrocarbons in lab scale diffusion flames will                     also be explored.                                                                                                                                               The general objectives of the first two activities are to                       enhance the understanding of laser-solid interactions and to                    use this knowledge in preparative and analytical applications.                  This will include optimization of laser sampling and pulsed                     laser deposition processes.  In addition, a better                              understanding of synthetic diamond formation is a goal.  In                     the latter activities, excimer laser photolysis has become the                  technique of choice for the preparation of a number of gas                      phase radical species for fundamental spectroscopic studies.                    Additionally, it is proposed that excimer laser photolysis of                   chlorinated hydrocarbons might also be used for the detection                   of undesirable combustion products.",
