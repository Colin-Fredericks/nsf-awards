Marcus, Office of Plans and Policy, U.S.                             Federal Communications Commission to carry out a                                collaborative project with Professor Takeshi                                    Hiromatsu, Chair of the Laboratory on Correlation of                            Information Technology and Society at the University                            of Tokyo's Research Center for Advanced Science and                             Technology (RCAST).  The project will also involve                              cooperation with Professor Tadao Saito of the                                   University's Electrical Engineering Department at the                           Hongo campus and also the Ministry of Posts and                                 Telecommunications' (MPT) Communication Research                                Laboratory in Koganei-shi, Tokyo.  Dr. Marcus'                                  research will include a study of Japanese radio                                 spectrum management policy as it relates to technical                           innovation.  His joint research at MPT will include                             the application of digital signal processing                                    technology to transmitter identification.                                       All countries, including the U.S., are faced with the                           common problem of how to regulate radio technology to                           further public interests and control interference                               between radio systems users.  The Japanese have                                 developed a unique system of governmental and                                   nongovernmental organizations to accomplish this task                           which has never been documented in detail in the                                English literature.  This project will document the                             interrelationships between these organizations and the                          impact that these have on technical innovation.                                 Meetings will be held with the various individuals                              involved from industry, academia and government.                                                                                                                The knowledge acquired on the Japanese regulation of                            radio technology will facilitate U.S. consideration of                          whether certain aspects might be of benefit in the                              U.S.  Such knowledge will also be helpful to U.S.                               firms which are considering whether to market new                               technology in the Japanese market.  Additionally, it                            will be helpful to the U.S. Government in support of                            negotiations seeking equity in international trade.                             All of the individuals named above as collaborators                             are well-known and respected in their area of digital                           signal processing.  It is believed that collaboration                           between these individuals will continue well past the                           formal termination of this award.",
