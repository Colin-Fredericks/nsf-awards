 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a workshop conducted by the Committee on Education of the               Law and Society Association, the major professional organization                for sociolegal scientists in the United States.  It is designed to              extend and intensify previous training efforts for approximately                30 new entrants into sociolegal science. In addition to providing               social scientific training to faculty with and students                         anticipating professional degrees from law schools, the summer                  workshop stresses the interdisciplinary character of the field of               law and social science by counteracting disciplinary perspectivism.             Attention is given to core debates and questions which serve to                 integrate the field.                                                                                                                                            Specifically, participants are recruited through advertisements in              the relevant scholarly newsletters and a special mailing to 700                 individuals to seek applications from minority scholars.  Twelve                distinguished faculty persons join the thirty participants for the              three day workshop.  Through sessions which feature small group                 exchange, hands-on mentoring, and follow-up after the workshop, the             workshop enables participants to work through specific research                 ideas and plans.  In addition, the workshop sessions expose                     participants to the core subfields of law and social science, the               relationships and settings for law and social science, and the full             range of research orientations associated with sociolegal science.              The workshop is significant in providing advanced interdisciplinary             training to individuals who are or soon will be teaching law and                social science in law schools and social science departments in                 colleges and universities across the United States.  Also, the                  workshop encourages more minority faculty and graduate students to              enter into this interdisciplinary field of teaching and research.",
