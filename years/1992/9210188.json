 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study the interaction of a protein tyrosine                 kinase (pp60 src) and a putative substrate, p130. When naturally                occuring point mutations occur in pp60 src, resulting in pp60 v-                src, or when site-directed mutagenesis is performed, pp60 src                   becomes oncogenic. The pp60 src protein probably functions in                   cellular signal transduction as well as in cell transformation. The             p130 substrate protein will be purified, peptides from it will be               microsequenced, and a molecular clone encoding the protein will be              isolated. Interactions between these two proteins and a third                   protein (p110) will be examined to try to determine their roles in              src-mediated cell transformation and other cellular processes that              pp60 src is involved in. The importance of the src homology 2                   domain will be assessed; this domain is believed to be involved in              protein-protein interactions related to signal transduction.                    %%%                                                                             Cells contain a variety of enzymes (kinases) which can add                      phosphate residues to certain amino acids in susceptible proteins.              Protein tyrosine kinases have been implicated in transformation of              cells from normal growth to cancerous growth. The best studied of               this group is pp60 src. This proposal involves the interaction of               pp60 src with a putative substrate, p130, and will investigate the              events following their complex formation which result in cell                   transformation and signal transduction.",
