 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications, COMAP,                     requests funding for a one-year planning grant to develop a large-              scale, long term project which addresses the need to carefully                  research, and plan comprehensive systemic changes in all aspects of             the mathematics preparation of preservice elementary teachers, in               particular the mathematics content courses and faculty enhancement.             The proposal will also begin implementation of key goals of the                 long term plan.  This proposal is a direct result and extension of              two previously funded Teacher Preparation Projects, TPE 90-54620,               and TPE 91-54518.  The former was a conference (3 meetings) of key              leaders in mathematics, mathematics education, and education,                   including professors, teachers, supervisors, state supervisors, and             researchers.  One outcome of the conference was the urgent need to              learn more about the current state of the mathematics preparation               of teachers;  this led to the second funded project to conduct a                survey and research this question.  With Exxon Foundation funding,              another meeting was held with a subset of the original participants             to look at the need to completely overhaul and redesign the                     elementary mathematics curriculum for elementary teachers with all              of its ramifications, in particular the role and support of the                 mathematics community and mathematics departments.                                                                                                              The proposers request funds for a project to define and develop                 specific mathematics content courses for preservice  elementary                 teachers.  These courses are based on the framework defined by the              MAA Call For Change and the NCTM reform documents, in particular                the Professional Teaching Standards and the Addenda Project to the              Curriculum and Evaluation Standards.  The project will address four             major goals and plan the long range strategies to address these                 goals:  development of a philosophical position  on the nature of               learning/teaching mathematics and the development of content                    courses for the mathematics preparation of elementary teachers                  based on previously developed standards;  identification and, if                necessary, planning the production of materials which exemplify the             philosophy and standards;  development of large-scale, multi-site               mathematics college/faculty enhancement projects; and enlisting                 support for the project from professional organizations, state                  certifying agencies, supervisors at all levels, school districts,               and specially mathematics departments.  This project has been                   endorsed by the president of the National Council of Teachers of                Mathematics and by the Exxon Foundation which has co-funded the two             previous grants.  The Advisory Board is representative of the major             mathematics organizations:  The Mathematical Association of                     America, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and the               American Mathematical Society.                                                                                                                                  COMAP will cost-share the project by providing support equivalent               to 32% of the requested NSF funding.",
