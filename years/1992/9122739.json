 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports continued theoretical quantum chemical                      studies of the dissociative recombination of N2 and the collisional             quenching of O+(2D) by O(3P).  The studies of N2  will provide rates            and quantum yields of atomic products as a function of ion                      vibrational level and electron temperature.  These quantities,                  which are difficult if not impossible to measure in the laboratory,             will allow for detailed ionospheric modeling of N2  and its                     dissociative recombination products.  The results will help to                  resolve the long standing discrepancy between measured ionospheric              N2 concentrations and the model results.  The complex interaction               between the N2 dissociation channels will be handled with a coupled             equations approach.  Also, a new dissociative route of                          recombination mechanism involving the mixing of dissociation routes             of the same symmetry through the electron-ion states will be                    treated.  These techniques will also be applied to a study of the               dissociative recombination of NO+  in order to determine the total              rate and the atomic quantum yields from v=O.  The N(2D) quantum                 yield from dissociative recombination of NO+ is an important                    quantity in many ionospheric models.  The rates for the aeronomic               collisional quenching reactions of O+(2D) and O+(2P) by O(3P) have              never been calculated theoretically or determined in the                        laboratory.  Potential curve calculations will be completed for the             quenching of O+(2D) and the cross section and rate will be                      calculated by solving the coupled equations.  A similar approach                will be used for the quenching of O+(2P).",
