 "awd_abstract_narration": "Xavier University of Louisiana and the University of New Orleans                propose to establish a Research Careers for Minority Scholars                   program for the purpose of recruiting promising high school                     graduates and currently enrolled students who will commit to                    pursuing graduate study in science or engineering.  The proposed                program will identify selected students and provide them with                   undergraduate and graduate teaching and research advisors, help in              obtaining summer research internships, and financial aid in                     sufficient quantity so as to facilitate student success.  The                   unique feature of the proposed project is the development of a                  Graduate Dual Degree (Bachelor of Science and Master of Science)                arrangement between Xavier University (for undergraduate degrees)               and the University of New Orleans (for graduate degrees) in                     chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics, and engineering.             Those students pursuing engineering careers will receive both the               Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degree from the                       University of New Orleans.  Structurally, this program is unique                not only in its ability to provide students an opportunity to                   obtain an undergraduate and a graduate degree, but also, in a time              frame which is reduced by one year from the traditional approach.               Numerically, we expect this proposed project ultimately to increase             the minority pool of doctoral candidates in the sciences by                     approximately 20% on a nation-wide basis.  The amount requested                 from the National Science Foundation for this project is $2,363,08              or only $10,503 per year per student to obtain a Bachelors and                  Masters Degree in either Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics               Physics, or Engineering.  University cost sharing is set at an                  additional $776,168.",
