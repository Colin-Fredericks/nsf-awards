 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to test and extend existing sequence stratigraphic              and sedimentological interpretations of rocks of Neoproterozoic to              earliest Cambrian age in the Adelaide geosyncline, South Australia.             Sequence stratigraphy provides an independent method for                        significantly improving intro-basinal correlation in sparsely                   fossiliferous rocks, and a physical context in which to analyze                 biostratigraphic, chemostratigraphic, magnetostratigraphic and                  geochronological data.  To the extent that the waxing and waning of             Neoproterozoic ice sheets must have influenced sea level, we infer              that at least some of the most persistent sequence boundaries are               of global extent.  This possibility needs to tested against the                 emerging stratigraphic record in key sections.  The Adelaide                    geosyncline was selected as a reference section for sequence                    stratigraphic research on the basis of its great thickness (15 km),             quality of outcrop, limited deformation and metamorphism,                       availability of seismic and core data in adjacent basins of the                 same age, varied biota (including acritarchs, trace fossils,                    Ediacara assemblage metazoa, and stromatolites), and amenability to             stable isotope geochemistry.  There is some potential also for U-Pb             geochronology of ash beds, and we propose to search systematically              for such layers.  The proposed research will be co-ordinated with               the work of others under the umbrella of Project 320 of the                     International Geological Correlation Programme (Neoproterozoic                  Events and Resources), with the long-term objective of documenting              and evaluating the connections between a variety of biological,                 environmental and tectonic phenomena recorded in younger                        Neoproterozoic rocks.",
