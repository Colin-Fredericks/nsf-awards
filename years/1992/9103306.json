Germogerova of the                                  Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of Applied                                Mathematics in Moscow, is to encourage leading                                  researchers in both countries to identify scientific                            priorities for long-term cooperative research in the                            area of numerical transport theory.  Ten scientists                             from each country will take part in the workshop,                               which will be held November 5-9, 1991 in College                                Station, Texas.  The United States and the Soviet                               Union have the two most active research communities                             in this field and they tend to be complementary                                 because of the Soviets' emphasis on mathematical                                approaches and the U.S. reliance on computational                               solutions.  It is thus expected that there will be                              significant results from this activity.                                                                                                                         This project fulfills the program objective of                                  advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                              researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to                            combine complementary efforts and capabilities in                               areas of strong mutual interest and competence in                               the field of basic scientific research on the basis                             of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
