 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research applying intelligent systems technology to problem in                  molecular biology is expanding rapidly.  Techniques such as                     artificial intelligence, neural networks, object-oriented                       databases, large-scale computer modeling, and robotics are being                successfully applied to problems in genetics, protein structure,                development, evolution, and many other aspects of biology.  The                 rapid growth in this interdisciplinary research has created a                   need for infrastructure development and program planning.  The                  preposed meeting will bring together about two-dozen active                     researchers in the field with representatives of NLM and NSF to                 discuss issues such as coordination of conferences and                          publication venues, distribution of research support,                           interdisciplinary training programs, and the sharing of data and                other resources. In addition to facilitating communication, the                 goal of the meeting is to produce a report describing community                 needs and a set of standing committees to help address those                    needs.  Intelligent systems technology is relevant to several key               problems in the HPCC Program.  Directly, advanced software                      technology and algorithms require intelligent systems technology;               and indirectly high performance computing systems will be                       developed based on novel intelligent software algorithms.  This                 proposal addresses some of the key issues in the problem domain                 of molecular biology, which have implications in many other                     problem domains of the HPCC Program.",
