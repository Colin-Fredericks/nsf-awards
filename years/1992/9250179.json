 "awd_abstract_narration": "Control of today's multi-input/multi-output robotic,                            manufacturing, aerospace, etc., processes requires modern                       control algorithms and multichannel digital signal processors                   (DSP).  It is important that undergraduates participate in some                 laboratory experiences in DSP real-time digital control.                        However, it is difficult to learn basic controls implementation                 as well as the programming and structure of DSPs in one                         laboratory course.A project being developed at the UTA                          Automation and Robotics Research Institute (ARRI) allows                        seamless integration of the TI TMS320 C30 DSP with Labview                      software.  Currently the DSP interface is not seamless, but                     requires one to learn Labview as well as the DSP operation -                    this is not possible in a one semester laboratory course.The                    ARRI DSP/Labview interface will allow Labview to be utilized in                 real-time controls as it has been in signal processing, and                     will be available to institutions nationwide.  It will allow                    the DSP to be treated as the operational amplifier is now                       treated in continuous-time control, making it possible to use                   the device without knowing the details of its operation.  The                   data passing, sampling, etc., processes will reside as virtual                  instruments (VI) in Labview.  In a laboratory course, the                       controller VI is selected and its coefficients set by the user.                 Advanced use in a project laboratory allows the implementation                  of sophisticated control algorithms by writing simple C                         programs without worrying about the DSP protocol.  ARRI was                     recently funded by a Texas ATP grant to develop the DSP/Labview                 interface.  This ILI grant will allow porting of that                           technology to a prototype undergraduate controls laboratory by                  purchase of four MAC/Labview stations.",
