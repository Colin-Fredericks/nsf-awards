 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate the concept               of an intelligent pallet.  The idea is to provide intelligence to               the media on which parts are physically carried through the various             manufacturing resources.  The pallets will be assumed to be                     enslaved in the system, each equipped with its own central                      processing unit (CPU) and memory devices.  In this scenario, the                manufacturing resources are merely agents which will service the                commands from an Intelligent Pallet to process, move, and/or                    assemble the part(s) it carries.                                                     This project includes the analysis of technological barriers               and economic feasibility.  Evaluation of the structure of the                   control system and its implementation including issues such as the              feasibility of a heterarchical control architecture, problems                   associated with wireless communication, and information flow will               also be addresses at both theoretical and experimental levels.                  Applicability and generalizability of the results of this effort                is enhanced through industrial collaboration and matching support               from the Purdue Engineering Research Center.",
