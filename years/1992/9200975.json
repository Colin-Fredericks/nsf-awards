 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of this work is to study connections               between the topology and arithmetic of real algebraic varieties.                The contributions of the investigator and his collaborator have                 uncovered such connections in the theory of real algebraic                      morphisms and complex structures on real algebraic varieties.  He               intends to continue his research in this direction.  Another                    topic for further investigation is approximation of smooth                      manifolds by real algebraic varieties.                                               Algebraic varieties are geometric objects which can be                     described by polynomial identities satisfied by the coordinates                 of their points.  \"Real\" means that the coordinate numbers are                  limited to ordinary real numbers, avoiding the square root of                   minus one.  While these are physically natural objects,                         paradoxically, the theory for treating them is in a far less                    satisfactory state than the one  permitting imaginary numbers,                  those involving the square root of minus one.  The investigator's               efforts have been directed to remedying this situation and have                 had some gratifying successes.",
