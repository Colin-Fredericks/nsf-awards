 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the Proctor Lake site in Texas, skeletons of hundreds of                young and adult dinosaurs, all of the same species, are found in                rocks over 110 million years old.  Good skeletons of adult                      dinosaurs are rare, especially for this geological period, and                  juveniles are even rarer.  Dr. Dale Winkler of Southern Methodist               University is excavating and studying this assemblage to gain                   insight into the changes in behavior, feeding, and locomotion                   that occurred in these animals during their growth.  These                      bipedal plant eaters (ornithopods) from Texas are small for                     dinosaurs (about 3-4 meters long), but related kinds found in                   Texas and many that evolved afterward are much larger.                          Determining how and why these evolutionary changes took place is                important for understanding the relationships between groups of                 dinosaurs.  Recent technical advances allow images of specimens                 to be entered into a computer by video camera for precise and                   rapid measurement and for storage and exchange of data.  This new               method along with statistical techniques will be used to                        determine if the process of evolving to larger size (over                       millions of years) follows the same pathway as the growth of an                 individual during its life.  To learn more about dinosaur                       behavior and life history, computer methods will also be used to                help demonstrate subtle differences in shape between male and                   female skeletons.  Knowing the sex of the dinosaur specimens will               reveal much about their nesting habits and social structure.                         Dinosaurs, like other reptiles, probably grew throughout                   their lives, so there have been many difficulties in recognizing                the age of dinosaur specimens (hatchlings, juveniles, adults).                  Because body shape usually changes during growth, young and adult               dinosaurs of the same species may look different and may                        mistakenly be called different species.  Studies of changes in                  species diversity through time and other evolutionary topics are                clouded by this problem.  To help solve this dilemma, the                       excellently preserved Proctor Lake samples will be used to map                  the shape changes that can be expected during an individual                     dinosaur's development.  Also, changes in internal bone structure               that occur during growth can be correlated with the changes in                  body form.  Quantifying both of these changes as a percent of the               largest adult size may provide a system for determining the                     growth rate and age of other dinosaur specimens for which a                     growth series is not available.  The results of this research                   will provide tools to understand how dinosaurs lived and                        diversified, ultimately dominating land faunas for over 150                     million years.",
