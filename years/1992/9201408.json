 "awd_abstract_narration": "A conference entitled \"Virus Assembly\"  will be held under the                  auspices of the Federation of American Societies of Experimental                Biology (FASEB) from July 26 to July 31, 1992, at the Vermont                   Academy, Saxtons River, Vermont.  This will be the second such                  conference, the first being held in 1990.  Although considerable                progress has been made in defining the mature structure of animal               and plant virions, much less is known of the intracellular                      processes directing the assembly of newly synthesized                           macromolecules into infectious highly organized virion particles.               These processes are likely to be virus specific and so targets for              therapeutic intervention.  Some recent findings have included the               role of chaperonins in structural protein maturation,                           phosphorylation of viral structural subunits, non-conservation of               symmetry in polyoma, and interference of the products of cloned                 genes with virus infection.  Such results led to the organization               of the first FASEB conference on \"Viral Assembly\" in 1990 as it was             realized there was and urgent need to examine and integrate the                 current knowledge of intracellular assembly of infectious virions.               The urgency arose from the fact that the last relevant conference              was held over seven years previously (EMBL, 1982).  The 1992 FASEB              conference will be build on the success of the 1990 conference in               bringing together leading investigators in the fields of assembly               and maturation of animal, plant and bacterial viruses.  A                       particularly important and well-received feature of the 1990                    conference was its organizations of sessions around specific                    processes and problems in virus assembly, rather than around                    particular viruses.  This led to an interchange and merging of                  knowledge from research workers in the fields of animal viruses and             bacteriophages.  Until the advent of the FASEB meetings, these                  communities had grown apart and so had no common forum.  Poster                 sessions, in addition to the oral sessions, will ensure an even                 wider communication of results among attendees and guarantee that               late-breaking or newly-developing investigations will be adequately             covered.  A new feature, suggested by many 1990 participants, will              be the availability of abstracts for the posters.",
