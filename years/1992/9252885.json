This process                     for curriculum development has been successfully piloted                        through a colloquium series initiated by the Citizens'                          Committee for Public Education in Philadelphia and                              facilitated by directors of PENNlincs with funding from                         PATHS/PRISM, ARCO and the Institute for Research in                             Cognitive Science, U of P.  The proposed program will                           improve the quality of science education and at the same                        time ensure that more time is spent on science education in                     kindergarten.  This project will bring developmentally                          appropriate science content and science processes to primary                    grade children in such a way (a)  that scientists, educators                    and parents will be assured that children are truly learning                    important science concepts and processes, (b) that the                          methods have applicability to the realities of classrooms,                      and (c)  that children's initial school experiences in                          science are rich and that children gain positive attitudes,                     motivation and vocabulary that will serve as a strong                           foundation for more formal science study.  The methods will                     enhance any science curriculum available or under                               development.",
