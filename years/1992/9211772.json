 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Virginia Coast Reserve (VCR) is an extremely dynamic,                       frequently disturbed landscape which is comprised of elements                   (e.g. grasslands, marshes) that differ in degrees normally                      associated with biome-level differences.  Because the frequency of              disturbance at the VCR is so great the types of ecosystem changes               that would normally occur across large distances (continents,                   biomes) and over long periods of time (e.g. glacial and                         interglacial periods) happen on decadal time-scales.   Ecosystem                state changes are frequent.  The central research theme of the VCR              LTER project is the understanding of the dynamics of ecosystem                  state change, both the transitions among ecosystem states and                   succession within these states.  The basic elements of this LTER's              theoretical concept of landscape dynamics are that 1) there are                 \"attractors\" in the ecosystem state space within which                          successional dynamics operate and 2) there are events that produce              transitions from one of these attractors to another.  The VCR LTER              will continue to study succession within several of the more                    prominent states (Myrica thickets and salt marshes) and the                     response of these states to disturbance.  This will be                          accomplished by research in the NSF-defined LTER network core                   areas as well as additional VCR-established areas as well as                    additional VCR-established areas examining states and state                     changes that have occurred at the VCR in geologic, historic, and                present-day context.  The VCR LTER will address the following                   working hypotheses: 1) The controls on succession within states                 are the availability of water, the salinity of that water, the                  frequency of tidal inundation, and sediment deposition; and 2)                  Gradients in salinity and tidal inundation frequency and thus                   organic matter accumulation, primary productivity, and nutrients,               are a function of the slope, sea level, and astronomical and storm              tides.  3) Many ecological state changes are triggered by                       infrequent, short-duration, intense disturbances such as coastal                storms.  The products of the proposed work will be the development              of a new theoretical base for maintenance and structuring of                    landscape, further elucidation of controls on ecosystem processes,              and new ecosystem and landscape modeling approaches.",
