This award                          supports development of a system which, given monitored data                    collected from multiple program execution observations, will                    trace back from a graph of a performance metric to the                          processes and portions of source code that should be modified                   to improve the metric.  The trace back is possible because all                  parts of the system, the source code, monitored data, graphs                    of performance metrics, and empirical and theoretical models,                   use a common state representation.  The system performs three                   novel functions.  First, it allows visual editing of monitored                  data from a small number of program executions to define                        aggregate states and an aggregate state transition rate matrix                  that can represent all observed program executions.  Second,                    it generates graphs of performance metrics from the empirical                   model, rather than from the monitored data, to accurately                       predict discontinuities in program behavior.  Third, it                         generates a theoretical model of program behavior that maps                     program behavior to a multidimensional Cartesian space.  The                    system is applied to a TCP/IP protocol implementation and a                     parallel discrete event simulation system.  Success in                          diagnosing performance problems in these large systems could                    change the way programmers design parallel and distributed                      software.",
