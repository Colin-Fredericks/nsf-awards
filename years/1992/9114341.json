 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a long-term visit by Dr. Donald T. Dubin of                 the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, the                     Robert Wood Johnson Medical School to work in the laboratory of Dr.             Peter R. Stewart on the molecular evolution of the bacterial                    genus Staphylococcus.  Members of the genus Staphylococcus are                  widespread in nature, as components of the normal flora of                      mammals and sometimes as causes of disease.  Dr. Dubin will spend               a 6-month sabbatical leave visiting the laboratory of Dr. Stewart,              where he will exchange expertise relevant to molecular                          characterization of staphylococcus genomes.  He will apply Dr.                  Stewart's procedures, including in vitro induction of deletions                 and pulsed field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA, to                     strains of staphylococci that are of special interest for                       epidemiologic and molecular genetic reasons.  These techniques                  will be complemented by techniques with which Dr. Dubin's                       laboratory has had extensive experience, including the                          oligonucleotide hybridization of Southern transfers of                          chromosomal DNA and polymerase chain reaction-facilitated                       sequencing of segments of genome expected to be useful in                       establishing phylogenetic relationships; namely, segments of                    ribosomal RNA genes.  The work will be directed toward goals                    shared by the two laboratories including better understanding of                the interaction between environmental factors (such as heavy                    metal pollution) and widespread agricultural and medical use of                 antibiotics and intrinsic genetic factors, in the rapid evolution               of staphylococcal species and strains.",
