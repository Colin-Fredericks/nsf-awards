 "awd_abstract_narration": "The existing computer programs for simulation of the motion of                  multi-body mechanical systems generally require excessive                       execution time for realistic systems and this renders them not                  suitable or inconvenient for use in design phase.  Additionally,                these programs do not have good provisions for common drive                     subsystems which often involve planar linkages or geared                        mechanisms.  A dynamic formulation methodology based on the                     recognition that a large number of mechanical system can be                     modeled as consisting of an open loop chain or tree of bodies,                  which are the primary links of the system, and their drive                      subsystems, which together with the primary links always form                   local closed kinematic loops.  The proposed research is to                      develop such a methodology that calls for the identification of                 independent generalized coordinates for the local closed loop                   through graph representation concept and kinematic analysis, the                use of efficient recursive formalism for the primary chain or                   tree and the derivation of additional contributions from the                    local closed loops.  It is anticipated that a user-friendly and                 computationally efficient program can evolve from this research                 and can be made commercially available to the public.  The                      resulted program can enable mechanical system designers to                      perform effective simulation in the various design phases to                    reduce the design turn-around time and the design costs, and to                 improve the quality of design.",
