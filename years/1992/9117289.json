 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the conspicuous large-scale changes in the Mesozoic                 marine fossil record is the decline of the stenolaemate order                   Cyclostomata and the rise of cheilostome bryozoans to the same                  approximate level of dominance in marine faunas that had previously             been occupied by stenolaemates.  Such large-scale turnovers between             taxonomically related and/or ecologically similar groups may be due             to competitive replacement, to accumulated \"small-scale\" chance                 events that by happenstance favor one group over the other, or to               the destruction of the formerly dominant group during a mass                    extinction, followed by the radiation of the second into the                    vacated ecospace.                                                                    Timing of the cyclostome-cheilostome turnovers does not                    correspond with a major mass extinction.  Competitive interactions              between recent cyclostomes and cheilostomes favor cheilostomes,                 suggesting that competitive replace is a viable hypothesis.  The                hypothesis will be tested through predictions of the effects of                 competition between the two clades as seen in the Mesozoic to early             Cenozoic fossil record.  Implications of the study are much larger              than better insight into this one pattern.  If tests of the                     predictions support the predicted changes, this should provide                  strong evidence for the importance of organic interactions in                   determining macroevolutionary patterns.",
