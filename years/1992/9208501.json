 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the research of Professor J. Hsia to work              on problems in number theory.  Professor Hsia will continue to work             on the arithmetic of integral quadratic forms.  In particular, he               will work on the representation theory of positive definite                     quadratic forms.  He also intends to continue his study of an                   Iwasawa type theory for spinor genera.                                               This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                   theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                  divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                   oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,               it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for                computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.",
