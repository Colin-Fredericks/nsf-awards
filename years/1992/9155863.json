 "awd_abstract_narration": "To address the problems of ineffective entry-level science                      courses and inadequate preparation for pre-college science                      teachers, introductory environmental science laboratory courses                 are being developed that utilize investigative procedures and                   provides experiences for undergraduates interested in science                   education.  In the investigative laboratory students work                       collaboratively in groups of 8-10 to identify a research                        question, develop and carry out the protocol necessary to                       answer the question, analyze and interpret the data, and                        communicate their results both orally and in writing to a                       general audience. Each group is led by a student from the                       upper-level science education course, who also receives                         instruction on teaching science methodology, leadership skills,                 and strategies to stimulate enthusiasm for scientific inquiry.                  The goals of this project are to 1) introduce the excitement of                 scientific inquiry in an entry-level science course, 2) develop                 a model to integrate entry-level science courses with upper-                    level courses on science education, and 3) better prepare                       precollege teachers to teach the methods of scientific inquiry.",
