 "awd_abstract_narration": "Characterization of landscapes into domains where soil,                    hydrologic, and landform attributes can be considered products of               common processes of formation and function in an integrated                     manner remains a challenge for earth scientists.  Such a                        synthesis is desirable to advance fundamental and applied                       knowledge of earth surface processes operating at a local scale.                Although a close relationship among soil, landform, and hydrology               has long been recognized, a coherent framework that promotes                    disciplinary integration has yet to emerge.  Scale, space, and                  time, the three-dimensional complexity of the interdependencies,                and divergent disciplinary foci pose considerable challenges to                 effective integration.  This study will build upon advances made                through linkage of hydrology and geomorphomotry for terrain-                    based modeling of hydrologic processes.  It will develop and                    evaluate approaches to incorporate approximations of the soil-                  landscape continuum into terrain models.  It will develop a                     three-dimensional model of the soil-landscape continuum with a                  geographical information system (GIS).  The research will                       construct a model of soil horizon stratigraphy for the study of                 local and regional earth surface processes which require an                     understanding of processing operating in the pedosphere.  The                   model will be tested in a reconstruction of soil-landscape                      evolution in the Driftless Area of southwestern Wisconsin, which                had experienced considerable landscape instability during the                   Quaternary Epoch.                                                                    This study uses a new conceptual and methodological approach               which will improve upon more conventional ways of elucidating                   soil-landscape relationships.  It will reduce reliance on                       subjective assessments in soils analysis and replace it with a                  spatially rigorous analytic model.  The model will be developed                 and tested for soil-landscape evolution, but it will be                         applicable to surface and subsurface hydrologic modeling and for                simulating vegetation and landscape change in response to                       climatic change.",
