 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose to study the biological diversity,                    community structure, and energetics of a Neotropical rain forest                                                                                                canopy ant assemblage.  Although ants are thought to be, in                     general, predators and scavengers, they are probably the most                   abundant arthropod group in tropical forests trees.  Their                      abundance poses an ecological paradox, because predators should                 not                                                                             be more abundant than the herbivores on which they feed.  The                   investigators will test the hypothesis that most rain forest                    canopy                                                                          ants derive the bulk of their energy from plant resources and                   function essentially as primary rather than secondary consumers,                                                                                                which may enable them to support comparatively dense populations.
