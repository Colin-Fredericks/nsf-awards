The purpose is to establish the state of the art                                and outline a rational five-year research plan                                  to address the various aspects of analysis and                                  design of marine risers.  In particular, the                                    topics of design, structural mechanics, model                                   tests and field measurements, flow induced                                      vibrations, and loading conditions will be                                      studied.  The best forty people from around                                     the world have agreed to particpate in this                                     workshop, contribute written discussions or                                     papers and write the final report.  The                                         majority of the people agreed to pay most of                                    their expenses which provides a high leverage                                   to the NSF money.  An important aspect of                                       this effort is that it will provide well though                                 research advice to the NSF offshore                                             Technology Research Center of the University                                    of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M at                                             College Station.  The workshop will be                                          organized and chaired by Professor Michael                                      M. Bernitsa who will also be the editor of the                                  workshop report.  Professor R. Miksad of the                                    University of Texas at Austin will co-chair the                                 workshop.",
