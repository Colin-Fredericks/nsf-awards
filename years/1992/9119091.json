 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project includes an intensive field collecting phase                  and a follow-up laboratory analysis phase, in that order.  The                  field research centers on making research collections almost                    entirely in Mexico, under the direction of a Mexican scientist                  and his students, of the conspicuous and extremely diverse lizard               genus Sceloporus.  Of the specimens collected, at least 60% will                be deposited as standard museum vouchers in a research collection               at Mexico's National University, and the remaining specimens (the               final proportions will be determined by permit requirements) will               likewise be catalogued in U.S. collections.  Simultaneously,                    large collection of frozen tissue samples will be made from these               animals upon their capture, and all frozen tissues will be                      returned and catalogued into U.S. tissue collections.                                Species and distinct populations will be collected                         nonrandomly so as to maximize the utility of the samples for                    addressing a variety of basic questions in ecology and historical               biogeography.  For example, selected species are to be collected                from the Baja Peninsula, some islands in the Sea of Cortez, and                 the western mainland of Mexico for the purpose of testing                       alternative ideas concerning the derivation of island populations               relative to those of Baja and the mainland.  These data will have               important implications for understanding the origins of entire                  island biotas, since all species present on these islands were                  subjected to the same geological events which formed the Baja                   Peninsula and the Sea of Cortez, and for emphasizing the value of               these still largely intact systems for conservation.  A second                  group of lizards will be collected from the transverse volcanic                 range of central Mexico because these populations display                       different stages of the transition from egg-laying to live-                     bearing reproductive modes associated with adaptions to high                    elevations.  In both cases, laboratory work will utilize two                    independent classes of molecular markers, including proteins and                DNA molecules, to reconstruct the genealogies of the populations                sampled.  The lab work will support extensive training                          opportunities and collaboration for both Mexican and U.S.                       graduate students and research associates.",
