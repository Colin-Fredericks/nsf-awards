 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to determine the                  thermal history of the Newark Basin via fission-track and 40Ar/39Ar             analysis of sediment core from the Newark Basin Scientific Drilling             Project and surface samples together with some geophysical modeling             of the basin evolution.  The principal investigators will undertake             about 75 fission-track analyses consisting of both surface and                  subsurface samples.  The vertical sections provided by the wells                will provide geothermal gradient restraints and data from the                   intermediate age rift sediments whose outcrop distribution is poor.             The surface samples will densify the regional age distribution and              detail the recharge zone for hydrothermal circulation identified                along the border fault by their earlier work.  In addition to the               fission-track analyses, approximately a dozen samples will be                   subjected to 40Ar/39Ar analysis.  These samples will include Newark             Basin clastics (surface and subsurface), granophyres from the                   Palisades Sill, and basement rocks adjacent to the Newark Basin.                These will provide a higher-temperature framework with which to                 evaluate the fission-track data.                                                                                                                                     In order to decipher the fission-track data, the principal                 investigators will numerically model the apatite age and track                  length distributions to invert for the temperature history of each              sample.  These estimates of the cooling history will be combined                to determine the low temperature thermal evolution of the Newark                Basin.  The zircon and sphene fission-track ages will help to                   constrain the higher temperature thermal history.",
