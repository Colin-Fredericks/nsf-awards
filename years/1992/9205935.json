 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zooplankton are the major pathway for carbon transfer to                   higher trophic levels, and to deeper water and the sediments.                   Estimates of zooplankton production are critical in understanding               how short and long term variations in primary production affect                 these rates of carbon transfer.  Drs. Landry, Huntley and Lopez                 have hypothesized that copepod growth is predictable with                       first-orderprecision from habitat temperature alone.  If this                   relationship proves to be robust, we will have a powerful tool for              estimating zooplankton production.  However, the apparent                       simplicity of this relation raises major issues about plankton                  dynamics since it denies the usual assumption that zooplankton are              food-limited.  These investigators from the Universities of                     California and Hawaii will investigate the thesis that, at the                  population level, food limitation of copepods operates mainly                   through changes in mortality rate.  They suggest that there is                  strong evidence for this in fish populations where density                      dependence operates on the mortality of the early life stages.                  Thus, the general solution of the Malthusian dilemma for marine                 populations is to die young rather than starve later.  They will                address these key questions in the following ways:                              -    (1) Direct measurements of the generation times of a variety               of warm-water copepod species, to fill a critical gap in the                    database;                                                                       -    (2) Experimental testing of the hypothesis that size-specific              predation pressure can compensate for the effects of food-limited               growth rate by increasing apparent development rate at the                      population level.",
