 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photo-induced intramolecular electron transfer will be studied                  in ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) complexes containing chelating                  ligands with nitrogen donors.  The goal of the research is to                   elucidate the role of solvent dynamics in controlling the rate                  of excited state electron transfer when both internal and                       solvent-induced reaction barriers exist.  Reaction rates will                   be determined in solvents with different relaxation rates and                   the experimental results compared to theoretical predictions of                 the contribution of inner- and outer-sphere reaction barriers.                  Photoexcitation will place the system at its transition state                   where, if theoretical predictions prove valid, non-exponential                  dynamics will be observed.  Excited state electron transfer                     between ligands will be observed in both symmetric and                          assymmetric complexes using picosecond absorption polarization                  spectroscopy.  In addition, studies will be carried out                         concerning solvent effects on excited state proton transfer                     reactions in porphyrin complexes.  The experimentally                           determined rates, activation energies, and preexponential                       factors will be interpreted using theories constructed by                       analogy to excited state electron transfer kinetics.                            %%%                                                                             In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                             Organometallic program, Dr. David F. Kelley of Department of                    Chemistry at Colorado State University will excite various                      transition metal complexes photochemically and measure the                      subsequent rapid rates of electron transfer within the excited                  molecules.  While this work is of a very fundamental nature,                    the results are relevant to development of a theoretical                        framework for utilization of solar energy.",
