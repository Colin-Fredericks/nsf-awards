The program will diagnose and teach                 at three levels (based on Gagne's cognitive skills hierarchy)                   of scientific computational skills--reviewing specific science-                 related math skills, applying math to specific science-related                  tasks and performing scientific problem-solving.The program,                    draws upon all the graphic, sound, computer-branching, and                      video capabilities of multimedia instruction, will include a                    test instrument that will be used to assess students prior                      knowledge, devise an individualized learning plan, and evaluate                 knowledge gained.  The instructional components will be                         \"generic\"--not specific to any one science discipline--but                      separate problem sets will be developed for biology, chemistry,                 and physics thereby customizing the program to each                             discipline.The innovative curriculum, including adaptation of                   classroom instruction, will be evaluated at the project                         colleges, as well as several other two-year colleges serving as                 independent peer review sites.",
