 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze the strategic aspects                 of international agreement on the abatement of emissions that                   cause transboundary pollution.  Some researchers have suggested                 that the problem of obtaining international cooperation has the                 structure of a prisoners' dilemma game in that all parties would                be better off if they cooperated, but any one of them has an                    incentive to cheat or break the rules.  Two important questions                 are raised about the appropriateness of using the this framework                for analyzing international agreements related to pollution                     problems.  One is whether the prisoners' dilemma construct is                   appropriate in this context.  And the second is whether, even if                it is, a cooperative solution will not be forthcoming.                          Cooperation is more likely to occur in a repeated game                          situations, where the same parties face each other time after                   time as is often the case with international relations.                                                                                                         This research will develop a theoretical framework for analyzing                the evolution of cooperation between countries in the area of                   international abatement control.  Such cooperation can emerge via               coalitions in a cooperative framework, or by tacit agreements                   that emerge via trigger strategies in repeated games.  Both                     approaches will be pursued in this project.  The notion of a                    critical coalition is introduced into the theoretical framework                 which is a coalition of countries agreeing to implement an                      abatement agreement that has certain stability properties.  This                project is important because it will produce useful insights into               the process of international negotiation on global change, and                  provide a basis for choosing negotiating frameworks and                         strategies that will lead to stable and positive outcomes.",
