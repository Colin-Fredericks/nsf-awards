 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a comprehensive examination of the phenomena of                 \"World Class Manufacturing\" from theoretical and empirical points               of view.  The theoretical component will synthesize the support for             World Class Manufacturing from the literature bases of operations               management, strategic management, organization behavior,                        organization theory, human resources management, and international              business.  The empirical component will develop a database of                   information about World Class Manufacturers in the United States,               Europe, and Japan, as well as traditional firms, for comparison.                This database will be used to test propositions concerning world                class manufacturing and its relationship to performance.                                                                                                        The data will be gathered using a set of questionnaires which were              developed using reliable and valid measures of the traits which                 characterize the management practices of World Class Manufacturing,             as well as a series of objective measures of plant performance.                 The data in the database will be the basis for a series of papers               relating various management practices to performance, for World                 Class Manufacturers and traditional plants.  The data will be                   supplemented by qualitative information gathered during a series of             plant visits, which will include structured interviews as well as               plant tours.                                                                                                                                                    Thus, this project combines theory with quantitative and                        qualitative research in order to comprehensively examine World                  Class Manufacturing.  It will provide the foundation for an                     examination of manufacturing management, as well as answering a                 number of questions about the relationship of various management                practices to plant performance.  It is the first major examination              of World Class Manufacturing, and its findings should be of value               to both academics and practitioners.  Because of its interest to                industry, the project also is supported by 3M, Honeywell, and                   Donaldson Company under the Joint NSF/Private Sector Research                   Opportunities Program.",
