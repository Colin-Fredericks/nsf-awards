 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, in Genetics and Biotechnology, is a four year                     program that includes a Summer Institute, held at the                           University of Wisconsin - Madison, and a series of local, 1-                    2 week, outreach workshops conducted by lead teachers.  The                     target audience is secondary biology teachers, with strong                      emphasis on the high school level.  Teachers in rural                           communities and teachers of minority students will be                           specifically targeted.                                                                                                                                          The Summer Institute offers a series of one and two week                        workshops, so that participants can choose their areas of                       interest. 120 participants will be accommodated in the                          Summer Institutes each year. 10 lead teachers will be                           recruited each year, from these participants, and will be                       trained to conduct 1-2 week local workshops and to serve as                     local resource teachers.  Logistical support for these                          efforts will be provided by a developing network of regional                    support centers based at University of Wisconsin System                         campuses throughout the state.                                                  Significant local cost sharing will be solicited to support                     the local outreach efforts.  It is anticipated that over                        1,000 participants will be served by local outreach                             workshops.                                                                                                                                                      The specific objectives of the program are:                                      a. to enhance and update teachers' background in genetics                      and                                                                                 the biotechnology of genetic engineering,                                    b. to provide effective curriculum and teaching strategies,                     c. to facilitate transfer of content and process                                   restructuring into the classroom,                                            d. to develop science education leadership in teachers,                         e. to develop strategies to make science education                                 particularly                                                                    relevant to rural populations and minorities.                                                                                                               An amount equal to 43% of NSF cost will be provided as cost                     share.",
