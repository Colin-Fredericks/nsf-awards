 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research into the development of software tools that support               formal methods is aimed at simplifying and providing assistance during          the development of correct software.  Using a formal specification              language to describe a problem facilitates the verification of                  software correctness through automated reasoning techniques.  In                earlier work, the principal investigator developed the SEED system              that used formal methods to synthesize a correct program from a formal          specification.                                                                       The objective is to develop tools to support the use of formal             methods in all phases of software engineering including design,                 specification, implementation, and maintenance.  In order to address            the correct development of complex and large systems, the project               focuses on the development of object-oriented software using formal             methods.                                                                             The project comprises three parts.  First, developing a tool that          decomposes an informal problem description into formal specifications           with user assistance.  Next, investigating the development of a                 graphical browser that applies algorithms to formal specifications to           determine reuse.  Finally, addressing the issues of incorporating the           benefits of formal methods to existing code through the development of          a tool that abstracts formal specifications from program code.  The             tools will be integrated into a software development environment  that          supports formal methods, thus, facilitating the construction of large,          correct software systems.",
