 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                       research project between Professor Alex Inkeles, Senior Fellow,                 Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, Stanford                       Univesity, and Professor Tatsuo Suzuki, Department of                           Interdisciplinary Statistical Mathematics, Institute of Statistical             Mathematics, Tokyo.  Professor Inkeles will travel to Japan to                  work with Professor Suzuki and Professor Chikio Hayashi, also                   affiliated with the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, on                    developing a common methodology for further comparative study                   of U.S. and Japanese national character.  These two distinguished               Japanese social scientists have been involved with the Japanese                 Research Committee on the Study of the Japanese National                        Character.  Professor Inkeles, who is one of the leading experts on             the study of national character, will bring a comparative viewpoint             to the study, which will very likely lead to new developments in                this topic.                                                                                                                                                     Although national character is often treated in qualitative terms that          do not admit of scientific testing, one well established approach               does rest on basic methods of social science.  This approach                    defines national character as a set of relatively enduring psycho-              social characteristics of individuals that are predominant in, or               distinctive, or modal to a given national population.  It thus                  becomes a special element in the general methodology for                        comparing nations.  Taking that approach permits empirical testing              to establish the actual characteristics of national and sub-national            populations using either tests of personality, or, more commonly,               attitudes and value scales applied to representative national samples           at periodic intervals.  This approach has been most systematically              and consistently applied in the studies of the Research Committee               on the Study of the Japanese National Character.",
