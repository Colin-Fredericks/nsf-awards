 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments in the theory and statistics for measuring                  natural selection have allowed the action of selection on the                   phenotype to be measured separately from the inheritance of that                phenotype and these estimates of natural selection on phenotypic                traits have been used to address many contemporary theoretical                  issues in plant biology.  The proposed experiments with the salt                marsh plant Limonium carolinianum would provide measures of                     selection on reproductive traits and address three issues crucial               to a more complete understanding of selection estimates and                     genotypic responses to natural selection in wild populations:  1)               understanding the genetic basis and heritability of the                         quantitative traits being measured for selection estimates, 2)                  neighborhood parameters that determine the spatial scale over which             selection could cause adaptive change by and control the balance                between such change by natural selection or by random genetic                   drift, 3) experimental manipulation of environment that can                     identify the casual selective agents or partially explain why                   selection operates in an observed way.  Locally variable natural                selection, random genetic drift, and limited gene flow are all                  believed to play major roles in the local adaptation of plant                   populations.  However, simultaneous estimates of the spatial scale              of selection, amount of quantitative genetic variation available to             respond to selection, and neighborhood size and area have never                 been obtained in a wild plant species.  The study will contribute               to better knowledge of plant population change in sensitive and                 shrinking salt-marsh ecosystems.",
