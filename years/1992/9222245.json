 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molten polychalcogenide salt and hydrothermal techniques will be                used to explore the synthesis of new chalcogenide materials at low              and intermediate temperatures.  Both synthetic techniques will use              various A2Qx salts in reactions with late transition metals and                 main-group elements.  Reactions at temperatures between 200-500 oC              will be studied because this range has been little explored                     previously.  It has been demonstrated that in this temperature                  range new materials with new structure types can form and                       crystallize.  The remarkable ability of sulfur, selenium, and                   tellurium to bridge different sub-structures in two and three                   dimensions, and the relatively low temperatures provide a lucrative             opportunity for synthesis of a very large number of new compounds.              Physical properties of these new compounds to be explored include               magnetic, sorption as a function of temperature, and redox                      properties.  In order to probe unusual electronic phenomena, the                charge transport properties of the new compounds will be studied in             detail via variable temperature four-probe resistivity as well as               thermoelectric power (Seebeck) measurements.  The measurements will             be primarily done on single crystal samples.                                                                                                                    This grant is jointly supported by the Division of Materials                    Research, and the Chemistry Division.",
