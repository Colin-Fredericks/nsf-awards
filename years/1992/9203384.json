 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interfacial free energy between a polymer and water is                      relatively large.  As a result, proteins, platelets and cells                   will deposit upon its surface.  By modifying the surface                        properties of the polymers, one can reduce the interfacial                      free between them and water, and thus reduce the thermodynamic                  driving force for deposition.  The following surface                            modification technique, which employs two immiscible liquids                    in contact, will be investigated.  One of the liquids is water                  and contains a water soluble surfactant, while the other                        liquid is an organic compound which is selected so as to be a                   solvent for the polymer substrate.  It is convenient for the                    organic phase to be more dense than water.  The substrate is                    introduced for a short time in the organic phase.  This                         softens its surface and allows the entanglement of the                          hydrocarbon chains of the surfactant molecules and of the                       surface molecules of the polymer substrate during the pulling                   out of the substrate through the water-organic solvent                          interface and the water phase.  The two-phase system provides                   an interface at which the surfactant molecules adsorb.  This                    highly oriented surfactant layer increases the efficiency of                    the transfer of surfactant to the substrate.  The interfacial                   free energy between the modified polymer surface and water is                   thus decreased below 1 dyne/cm.  This can reduce the                            deposition of proteins, cells and platelets on such surfaces.                   The adsorption of proteins on the non-modified and surface as                   well as the stability of the modified surface will be                           investigated to verify the effectiveness of the procedure.",
