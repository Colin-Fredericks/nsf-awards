The equipment will allow new                                       computer-graphics-based algorithms for the analysis of radiant                  exchange. These algorithms have the potential for greatly                       enhancing the speed and accuracy of radiant calculations in                     complex geometries.  The CCD camera will be calibrated as a                     spectrophotometer to provide fast spectral images of an                         illuminated environment. Spectral information will be achieved                  by using broadband filters and computer-based spectral                          inversion. The measured images will be compared with                            calculated images. The equipment will allow detailed                            assessment of calculation methods in geometrically complex                      environments. The requested                                                     spectroradiometer and reflectometers will allow a variety of                    hemispherical and bidirectional reflectivities to be measured                   over a wide wavelength range. Such data is required as input                    for simulation algorithms. It will also be used to assess new                   wave-optics-based bidirectional reflectance models.",
