 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cyanobacterial Photosystem I reaction center is a light-driven              oxidoreductase catalyzing electron transport from cytochrome c533 to            ferredoxin.  The long-term goal of this research program is to                  understand the structure and function of the Photosystem I reaction             center.  In this project biochemical resolution and reconstitution              are combined with site-directed mutagenesis and protein                         overproduction in E.coli to produce reaction centers with altered               spectroscopic and electron transport properties.  Building upon our             most recent results and the tools developed and mutants constructed             in the current funding period, the following long-term goals will               be addressed:                                                                   1.  The roles of FA AND/OR FB in the room-temperature photoreduction                of ferredoxin (or flavodoxin) and NADP+ via FNR.                            2.  Biochemical characterization of the two forms of FNR identified                 in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002.                                              3.  Characterization of the remaining genes encoding PS I                           polypeptides in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002.                                 4.  The roles of PsaD and PsaE in PS I structure and function.                  5.  The mechanism of the specific interactions between the PS I                     complex and ferredoxins and flavodoxin.                                     6.  The 3-dimensional structures of the PsaC, PsaD, PsaE, and FNR                   proteins.                                                                   7.  The nature of the PsaE- and NdhF-dependent paths of electron                    transport in P700+ re-reduction.                                            %%%                                                                             All life on Earth ultimately depends on solar light energy capture              during photosynthesis, a process which leads to the reduction and               fixation of carbon dioxide and the evolution of oxygen gas as a by-             product.  Light energy capture and transduction takes place in                  multiprotein complexes known as reaction centers, which utilize the             light energy to initiate oxidation-reduction reactions and electron             transfer events which result in the production of chemical energy               (in the form of ATP) and chemical reductant (in the form of NADPH).             In oxygenic photosynthesis--the type which occurs in green plants,              algae, and bacteria known as cyanobacteria--the cooperation of two              reaction centers, denoted Photosystems I and II, are required.  The             long-term goal of the research here proposed is to understand the               structural organization of the Photosystem I reaction center and to             unravel specific details of the electron transfer events that lead              to charge separation, charge stabilization, and electron transfer               to soluable carriers in this reaction center.  The proposed project             is a marriage of two different research disciplines and is the                  result of a close collaboration and coordination of our research                activities with those of the laboratory of Dr. John H. Goldbeck                 (Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Nebraska).  A combination of              modern molecular genetics, recombinant DNA technology, site                     directed mutagenesis, protein overproduction and protein                        biochemistry (my lab) is combined with biochemical reconstitution,              modern ultra-fast laser spectroscopy, electron spin resonance (ESR)             spectroscopy, and other biophysical measurements (the Golbeck                   laboratory).  We will also jointly characterize alternative                     electron transport pathways involving the Photosystem I reaction                center (e.g, cyclic electron transport) and function of the                     alternative electron acceptors ferredoxin and flavodoxin.  Through              our work we hope to provide a better understanding of                           photosynthetic solar energy capture and photochemical conversion.",
