 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equipment augments a course which has two goals: to                         introduce students early in their career to the nature of the                   scientific process, and to decrease reliance on vertebrates in                  physiology laboratories.  The unique invertebrate experiments                   demonstrate essential basic principles and in some cases allow                  students to see phenomena which cannot be easily demonstrated                   in vertebrates.  The exercises are designed to enhance critical                 thinking and quantitative skills, introduce the use of micro-                   computers in the laboratory, and teach scientific methodology.                  Students design many of the experimental protocols within                       guidelines provided by the lab manual.  Students write their                    reports as \"scientific papers\" to acquaint them with the                        standard format of the scientific literature and to enhance                     their written communication skills.  An innovative approach has                 been designed for distribution of the new physiology laboratory                 exercises; instead of a traditional student lab manual, the                     material will be disseminated via a combination of published                    papers, posters at national meetings, and computer programs.                    Instructors can then modify the exercises for their laboratory                  situations and create personalized student manuals suited to                    their student populations and available resources.  The                         equipment includes a sea-water and environmental chamber,                       spectrophotometers, microscopes, osmometer, centrifuge, oxygen                  monitors, recorders, myographs, pre-amplifiers, and computers                   with printers and software.",
