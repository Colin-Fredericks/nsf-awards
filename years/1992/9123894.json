 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent reports have identified the potential lack of qualified                  scientists and technicians as a major concern in ensuring that                  basic ecological research can be undertaken. This research is of                primary importance in addressing current environmental issues.                  Neither the scientific nor the policy-making communities know the               demographics of trained ecologists in the United States. There is               no document identifying the number of ecologists employed and                   their areas of specialization. Educators, government agencies and               research institutions need to know what training is required for                the next generation of scientists.                                                                                                                              The Ecological Society of America, Public Affairs Office, will                  develop, publish, and distribute a survey assessing the human                   resources in ecology. The objectives of the study are to                        determine the pattern of graduate ecology degrees earned over the               past 30 years; determine ethnicity and gender composition of                    ecologists (This information would be compared to the demographic               composition of the work force as a whole); catalog the nation's                 environmental science capabilities according to problem area (eg.               how many scientists are trained to study the ecological                         complexity of global change); and analyze current employment                    patterns of ecologists. The resulting human resource survey would               provide direction to ecologists, other scientists, federal and                  state agencies, educators, and research institution in setting                  goals and designing programs over the next decade.",
