 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves both set theory and recursion theory,                focusing on various degree structures and the applications of                   forcing to degree-theoretic questions.  The investigator will                   continue to work on the analysis of priority arguments in the                   theory of recursively enumerable degrees and on the proof-theoretic             strength of these arguments.  Groszek and Theodore A. Slaman (Univ.             of Chicago) have been developing a uniform presentation for all                 levels of priority argument and tying these arguments to a standard             proof-theoretic hierarchy of fragments of Peano arithmetic.  In                 addition to continuing this development, Groszek will investigate               specific statements about the partial order of recursively                      enumerable Turing degrees, considering whether and how their proof-             theoretic strength reflects this analysis.  In a different vein,                Groszek will work on some long-standing open questions regarding                the degrees of constructibility.  Finally, she will consider the                question of which partial orders can be embedded into the Turing                degrees (assuming the failure of CH), one of the remaining open                 questions about the global structure of the Turing degrees.                          Prominent among the questions to be addressed by this project              are a number that bear on theoretical computability.  They lie in               what is known as recursion theory, which deals with a model of                  computability knowing no bounds on time or space.  Although answers             to such questions have the ability to illuminate practical                      questions, they are really practical only when their answers are                negative, for it is a very strong statement indeed to say that                  something cannot be computed even when one puts no limits on                    resources available for the purpose.  The finer structure of                    computability theory is sometimes more relevant to actual                       computations, and various aspects of that will also be considered.              A major thrust of the project is to equate degrees of computability             with specific levels in a well studied hierarchy dealing with the               logic of arithmetic.",
