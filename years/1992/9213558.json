 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop new methods for                          representing and solving decision problems.  The main focus is on               representation based on the framework of valuation-based systems                (VBS), a framework capable of representing uncertain knowledge in               many different domains including Bayesian probability theory,                   Dempster-Shafer's theory of belief functions, Spohn's theory of                 epistemic beliefs, and Zadeh-Dubois-Prade's possibility theory.                                                                                                 Preliminary results show that VBS representation is more                        expressive than both decision trees and influence diagrams, and                 the solution method is more efficient.  This project will study                 the expressiveness of VBS representations and the computational                 efficiency of the VBS solution method.                                                                                                                          While decision trees are based on the semantics of possible                     scenarios and influence diagrams are based on the semantics of                  conditional independence, VBS are based on the semantics of                     factorization.  In this project, the semantics of VBS will be                   extended to include conditional independence.  In addition, the                 project will begin the development of a coherent decision                       calculus for belief functions, epistemic beliefs, and possibility               theory.",
