 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective is to understand the biological function               of the mannose-6-phosphate / insulin-like growth factor II receptor             (M6P/IGF-IIR) in targeting lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes.  This                protein binds at least two distinct classes of ligands:                         phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes and IGF-II.  The biophysical                   properties and primary structure of the receptor strongly suggest               that other ligands not yet identified exist.  Preliminary studies               indicate that new classes of ligands and variant forms of IGF-II                bind to the receptor.  This proposal has three specific aims:  1,               protein ligands which bind to the receptor will be purified; 2, new             ligands will be identified, and their primary structures determined             by chemical methods and, if necessary, molecular cloning; and 3,                the new ligands will be characterized in terms of the parameters of             the receptor-ligand interaction and their biological effects on                 cultured cells.                                                                                                                                                 One of the most fascinating and provocative findings in cell                    biology in recent years was the discovery that the membrane bound               receptor for phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes, which is responsible             for targeting of lysosomal enzymes to the lysosomes and has binding             specificity for the phosphorylated mannose residues on these                    enzymes, and the cell surface IGF-II receptor, which is responsible             for detecting and binding a hormone-like growth factor termed                   insulin-like growth factor II, were in fact the identical molecule.             Subsequent work has shown that the two ligands bind to different                regions of the receptor.  Results from other laboratories suggest               that the receptor is vital for fetal development in mice, whereas               the two known ligands are not.  The hypothesis underlying this                  research project is that there are other biologically important                 ligands for this receptor, which bind at a region or regions                    distinct from those involved in the binding of either IGF-II or                 lysosomal enzymes.  This research will provide fundamental insights             into the function of this important membrane protein.",
