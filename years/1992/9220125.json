 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will assess the commercial impact on U.S. industry of                U.S. federal laboratories' scientific and technical outputs.  The               assessment will be from the perspective of industry.  Using data                from a recent comprehensive study of 297 federal laboratories                   performed by the U.S. GAO, a population of federal laboratories                 will be defined.  From that population a stratified probability                 sample about 40 federal laboratories will be drawn.  The                        laboratories' Office of Research and Technical Applications \u0131ORTA!              (or the equivalent) will provide information about technical                    activities of the laboratories and outputs used by industry.  The               technical activities of the laboratories and outputs used by                    industry.  The technical activities examined include not only the               direct products of federal laboratory research, development, and                demonstration (RD&D) activities, but also the indirect transmission             of knowledge and know-how.  From ORTA records, a sample of                      industrial users will be developed.  The study will gather                      qualitative and survey data from industrial users on such questions             as how the users became aware of federal laboratories' products,                barriers to use of the products, commercial value of the products,              and level and types additional technical development performed by               the user.  The study will also examine a set of \"non-users.\"  The               industrial users will be asked to identify firms similar (in size,              product lines, market share) to their own.  The investigators will              then contact those similar firms, identify \"non-users\" of federal               laboratory products, potential interest in those products, and                  perceptions about requirements for using federal laboratory                     outputs.  This design will (a) explain patterns of laboratory-                  industry interactions, and (b) assess the commercial impacts of the             federal laboratories.",
