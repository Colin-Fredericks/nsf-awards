 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sand-spurrey, Spergularia marina, is a common species of                   natural coastal wetland habitats throughout the world.  Like most               plant species, flowers of S. marina produce both male and female                gametes through the production of pollen grains and ovules.                     However, in contrast to most species, S. marina exhibits ten-fold               variation in pollen production, which represents allocation to                  male reproduction.  In addition, S. marina individuals show                     three-fold variation in average ovule production (from 50 to 150                ovules per flower), although this range of variation is not                     uncommon in flowering plants.  More importantly, the variation in               both stamen number and ovule number has a genetic basic and is                  thus likely to show change over time in response to selection.                  This species, therefore, provides an excellent opportunity to                   investigate the causes and consequences of variation in the                     allocation of floral resources to male and female gametes,                      commonly known as \"gender allocation\".  Currently, although there               exists a great deal of theoretical work on this topic, there are                no empirical studies that explore thoroughly the assumptions of                 this theory.  For example, it has long been believed that                       selection to increase male allocation (e.g. high pollen                         production) should necessarily result in a reduction in female                  allocation (e.g., reduced ovule or deed production), promoting                  the evolution of specialized reproductive systems.  This                        assumption, however, has never been adequately tested.                               Our study of the ecological genetics of sand-spurrey will                  test the assumptions of gender allocation theory by providing                   measurements of the genetic component to stamen and ovule                       production and measurements of any \"costs\" associated with                      increased allocation to male or female reproduction.  Moreover,                 our data will allow an evaluation of the evolutionary flexibility               of S. marina - and species similar to it - and its ability to                   alter its productive biology in response to changes in its                      increasingly threatened habitat.",
