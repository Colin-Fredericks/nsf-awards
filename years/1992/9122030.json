 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will work on conformal field                    theories associated to the Monster simple group.  These will                    provide the first constructions of conformal field theories on an               orbifold corresponding to cyclic groups of order greater than                   two.  Constructions based on all 23 Niemaier lattices will be                   investigated, with the expectation that clues to a covariant                    construction of the Moonshine module based on the 26-dimensional                Lorentzian lattice will emerge.  The principal investigator will                also investigate the genus zero partition functions associated to               certain sporadic groups which he has recently discovered.  Some                 recent ideas involving the interplay between algebraic varieties                and group representations will be pursued.                                           This research is concerned with problems in group theory.                  In classifying the finite simple groups, a particularly large                   group which is called the Monster simple group was discovered.                  Subsequently, it has been found that the Monster simple group has               interesting connections with the study of Lie algebras and with                 mathematical physics.  This particular project is aimed at better               understanding these relationships.",
