 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microwave and analog engineering research is important to                  companies for the development of advanced communication systems of              the future.                                                                          Planning activities at Villanova University have developed a               base of support for a research program addressing components of                 advanced communication systems, i.e. specific antenna                           configuration, high power and high efficiency devices, and the                  development of equipment and techniques to characterize the                     microwave properties of materials.  Enough companies are supporting             the research program to form a Industry/University                              Cooperative Research Center for Microwave/Analog Engineering at                 Villanova University.                                                                The initial research agenda of Villanova University's                      Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                             Microwave/Analog Engineering will address; 1) low profile antennas              for communication links, 2) a high power and efficiency amplifier,              3) theoretical electromagnetics, and 4) communication satellite                 architectures.                                                                       There are six company sponsors and five affiliate company                  sponsors for the Center committing approximately $300,000.                           The Principal Investigator/Center Director and his colleagues              have the knowledge and facilities to run this Center.                                This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center is being              coordinated with Dr. Lawrence Goldberg, Program Director, Quantum               Electronics Waves and Beams.                                                         The Program Manager recommends Villanova University be awarded             $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.                          Near the end of the first year the Program Director will                   review the progress of the Center on a number of criteria,                      including the following: 1) the extent to which the university-                 industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the                  support base is developing; 3) the extent to which a robust                     research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the             Program Director will recommend support for the next period of this             continuing award.",
