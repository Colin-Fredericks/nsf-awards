 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of Lie algebras has played a significant role in                mathematical research during this century.  Important roles have                been played by finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras,                      modular Lie algebras and Kac-Moody Lie algebras.  The most                      dramatic progress in the classification and structure of finite                 dimensional Lie algebras has been the recent solution of the                    classification problem for simple Lie algebras over algebraically               closed fields of characteristic p>0.  Despite this work, many                   important areas of research remain, including the                               characterization of important classes of Lie algebras (e.g.,                    nilpotent, solvable) by homological properties and the search for               structural results.  There has also been substantial work over                  the last decade on the representation theory of restricted Lie                  algebras of classical type.  While some of this work has been                   associated with the solution of the classification problem, much                more of it has been motivated by connections with the modular                   representation theory of semisimple algebraic groups.  Finally,                 the study of the representation theory of affine Lie algebras has               been one of the most rapidly growing parts of algebra since its                 inception twenty years ago.  The problem of finding explicit                    constructions of modules for affine Lie algebras has been                       attacked by various methods.                                                         This project will support the Conference on Structure and                  Representation of Lie Algebras to be held from April 17-19, 1992                at Yale University.  Topics will include the classification and                 structure of finite dimensional Lie algebras, representation                    theory of finite dimensional Lie algebras over fields of positive               characteristics, and representation theory of Kac-Moody Lie                     algebras.  The format will consist of plenary lectures of an                    expository nature by leading experts as well as some shorter,                   more specialized talks.",
