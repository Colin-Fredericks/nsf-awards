 "awd_abstract_narration": "Time-Division Multiplexing is a technique for sharing multi-                    terahertz bandwidths of optics among multiple users connected to                a common channel of a communication network, or among multiple                  processors in a time-multiplexed optical multiprocessor.                        Communication among such users or processors requires time-domain               permutation via a time-slot permuter.                                                                                                                           The project is to design a wide array of time-slot permuters with               different hardware and control complexities for different                       applications.  The approach is to apply the rich knowledge in                   spatial interconnection networks to the permutation networks in the             time-domain.  We have formulated a general method for a mapping                 from the space-domain to the time-domain, and have demonstrated how             the method can be used to design new time-slot permuters.  The new              designs will be verified with the simulator HATCH developed for the             logic level verification of optical systems at the NSF Engineering              Center for Optoelectronic Systems at the University of Colorado at              Boulder.                                                                                                                                                        Time-slot permuters have very important applications in time-                   multiplexed communication networks, and in pipelined processor                  architectures where rearrangement of pipeline slots is required as              in a time-multiplexed optical multiprocessor.  The proposed                     research will enhance the knowledge base in the relations between               permutation networks in space-domain and permutation networks in                time-domain, as well as in tradeoffs between switching and control              complexity in different permutation architectures.  Such a                      knowledge base is critical for advancing the dissemination of                   optical technologies in high performance computing and                          communication.",
