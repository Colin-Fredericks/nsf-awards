 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth of herbivores is recognized by most researcher to               be limited in large part by a plant's nitrogen content.  When a                 plant is eaten, its remaining tissues exhibit a plethora of                     responses that include not only the dramatic increases in the                   concentrations of \"secondary\" metabolites (the putative induced                 defenses which presumably contribute to a plant's resistance to                 herbivory) but also a suite of physiological responses that                     include increases in photosynthetic rates( which presumably                     contribute to a plant's resilience to herbivory).  This proposal                examines how a plant integrates these two suites of responses and               thus asks how a plant resolves the potentially conflicting                      demands of its \"defensive\" and \"civilian\" biochemical responses                 to herbivore attack.  This metabolic integration will be examined               in a species of plant (Nicotiana sylvestris) where both the                     \"defensive\" responses--the production of toxic alkaloids--and the               \"civilian\" responses--included photosynthetic capacity--make                    large demands on a plant's nitrogen budget.  Since nitrogen is                  frequently the important limiting element for plants growth, we                 will choreograph the movement of nitrogen between alkaloid and                  protein synthesis in order to examine this metabolic integration.                    Research on pest-resistance in agriculture has been focused                on two fronts:  the chemical and physical of plants that confer                 resistance to pest attack and the physiological attributes of                   plants associated with resilience to herbivory.  Little, if any                 research has explored the integration of both the defense against               and the tolerance to herbivory.  And understanding of this                      integration is essential if we are to proceed beyond the                        \"pesticide-approach\" to plant protection.  This will be the first               project to examine chemical defense as an integral part of the                  physiological processes by which plants regrow those tissues lost               to herbivores.",
