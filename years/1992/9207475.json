 "awd_abstract_narration": "The earliest history of land-living vertebrates, from 370-320              million years before present, is represented by a very few fossils              from a handful of localities.  Most of these fossils are poorly                 preserved and incomplete, which makes it difficult for                          paleontologists to interpret the early history of terrestrial                   vertebrates.  Much has been learned from study of the                           currently-available fossils, and more can still be learned from the             few available examples.  However, further progress in understanding             the earliest history of land-living vertebrates will come primarily             from the discovery of new fossils.                                                   In 1985, a new locality containing numerous fossils of early               land vertebrates was discovered in southeastern Iowa near the town              of Delta.  The Delta site has been dated by geologists at about 340             million years old, which makes it the oldest early-land-animal                  locality in the United States, and one of the oldest in the world.              Over a periods of three years, more than 600 specimens including                about 50 partial skeletons, some nearly complete, were collected;               most of this collection is stored in the Field Museum of Natural                History, and some at the University of Iowa.  The fossils are                   well-preserved and the collection represents the largest number of              good specimens of any early-land-vertebrate locality.  At least                 three new species are present, each very primitive.  These three                species represent an increase of about 20% in the known number of               such early land vertebrates.  The Delta fossils thus comprise one               of the most significant paleontological discoveries in decades.                      Field Museum fossil preparators have already spent over 3,000              person-hours on Delta specimens.  Support for this research project             will fund a further 700 hours of technical help.  The majority of               this effort (560 hours) will be focused on preparing additional key             specimens of the most abundant species in the delta collection for              scientific study.  The remainder (140 hours) will be used to                    produce scientific illustrations of this species for publication.",
