 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combining techniques from disparate areas (Algebra,                       Geometry,and Combinatorics) the investigator and his coworkers                  recently determined the generic dimension of trivariate spline                  spaces (of sufficiently high degree) defined on tetrahedral                     decompositions.                                                                      In this project the techniques will be further developed and               applied to multivariate spline research, particularly as regards                the following problems: exact dimension formulas, improved upper                and lower bounds on dimensions, dependence of the dimension on                  geometric degeneracies, existence and construction of local                     bases,identification of useful sub- and superspaces of the full                 spline space, solvability of interpolation problems, effects of                 degeneracies on numerical stability and solvability of                          interpolation problems, algorithms, surface design, approximation               of functions defined on surfaces, and investigation of domain                   partitions other than simplicial ones.                                               Splines are smooth piecewise polynomial functions.  They are               used ubiquitously to solve problems involving functions of one                  independent variable.  Regarding functions of several independent               variables, splines (which in this context are called                            \"multivariate splines\") are much less understood and their                      structure is vastly more complicated.  Yet they have great                      potential for applications such as the solution of partial                      differential equations (e.g., modeling fluid flow, heat                         distribution, combustion, or radioactive decay), interpolation                  and approximation of data, and the design of shapes (e.g., of a                 vehicle).  They are also fundamental objects that deserve to be                 studied in their own right.",
