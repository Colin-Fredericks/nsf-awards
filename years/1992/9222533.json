 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators study the spatial and temporal dynamics of               territory formation for wolves (Canis lupus) and the resulting                  impact on the distribution of white-tailed deer(Odocoileus                      virginians).  Their model is based on field studies from                        northwestern Minnesota that indicate that adjacent wolf packs                   form  distinct territories that are separated by \"buffer zones\"                 where packs rarely trespass.  These buffer zones can provide a                  spatial refuge for the primary prey species: white-tailored deer.               The field studies show that deer density is higher in the inter-                territorial areas (refuges) and is lower near the center of                     established territories (where deer populations may be subject to               intense predation).  The buffer zones may also stabilize wolf-                  deer interactions by providing a reservoir of deer that can                     recolonize areas of wolf territory that have suffered heavy                     predation losses.                                                                    The mathematical model the investigators develop describes                 the behavioral wolf-wolf and wolf-deer interactions using a                     system of coupled of nonlinear partial differential equations,                  and describes the long-term ecological wolf-deer interactions                   using a system of coupled nonlinear difference equations. The                   analysis of the model equations will employ mathematical and                    numerical techniques from areas such as perturbation theory and                 finite difference numerical methods.  This should lead to a                     detailed quantitative understanding of wolf territorial pattern                 formation,  and an illustration of how territoriality influences                the distribution and abundance of deer.  The research will have a               wider application to the general area of territorial pattern                    formation; such patterns provide the basis for social                           organization in many mammals and birds.",
