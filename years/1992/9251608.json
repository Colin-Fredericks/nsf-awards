 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project equips the physics electronics laboratory with                     electrical measuring and test equipment at each of 8 lab                        stations.  The goal is to enhance the experimental component of                 the two sequential electronics and instrumentation courses                      directed at physics and chemistry majors by improving the                       efficiency with which circuits can be analyzed, by creating                     instructional units on electromagnetic interference and                         susceptibility, and by adding a significant project component                   to the second course.  A total of 18 weeks of laboratory                        exercises are being redeveloped for the new equipment,                          emphasizing hypothesis testing and quantitative analysis of                     circuit performance.  The project relies on the students'                       increased sophistication in data collection and analysis as                     gained in the prerequisite introductory and advanced modern                     physics laboratory courses, all of which make extensive use of                  scientific equipment interfaced with personal computers.The                     equipment purchased included in each station a dual-trace                       analog/digital storage oscilloscope with attached digital                       plotter, a dual-display digital multimeter, a function                          generator with adjustable sweep, and an adjustable, regulated                   DC power supply.  Six oscilloscope multiplexers and two digital                 LC meters have been acquired to supplement existing and                         compatible equipment.  The digital multimeters are supplied                     with IEEE-488 interfaces to permit their use with the                           department standard hardware and software for student projects.",
