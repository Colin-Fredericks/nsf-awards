Professor Shanov from the Technical University of                               Sofia will develop high temperature erosion                                     resistant ceramic coatings which will be further                                investigated at the University of Cincinnati in                                 regard to erosion and surface impacts when the                                  new coatings are exposed to high temperature                                    particulate flows.
