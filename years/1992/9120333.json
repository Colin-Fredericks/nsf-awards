 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at exploiting and extending capabilities for             treating the reduced magnetic ordering and related phenomena,                   including magneto-optic behavior, associated with the highly                    correlated f-electron state on approaching or being in the heavy                fermion state.  Essentially, we have learned how to exhibit                     magnetic ordering properties in the correlated-electron state by                projecting onto a site-centered basis.  Our materially-predictive               methodology involves two major stages: (1) the parameters in a                  lattice model hamiltonian containing both band-f hybridization and              band-f coulomb exchange are calculated by a sequence of electronic              structure calculations and, (2) a two-step sequence for finding the             magnetic ordering properties (ground state and equilibrium                      behavior, magnetic excitations, critical behavior) first                        transforming the model hamiltonian into the language of resonant                scattering theory to get an effective multipolar two-ion                        interaction and then using various methods we have developed to                 predict the observable properties on a wholly ab initio basis (no               adjustable parameters or empirical information used).  We will use              this methodology to predict the approach to and nature of magnetic              ordering in the heavy fermion state for seveal isostructural                    systems of experimental interest.  Our methodology will be extended             to include predicting (1) incremental specific heat associated with             magnetic ordering, (2) pressure effects and elastic properties, (3)             effects in high applied magnetic fields, (4) alloying including                 diluting the f-electron species.  In addition, we will initiate                 studies on the role of explicit (interconfigurational) correlation              effects on the magneto-optic behavior and on the conduction bands.              %%%                                                                             Computationally-intensive research will be undertaken to study the              magnetic properties of materials in which the electrons behave as               if their masses are many times their usual mass, ie, so-called                  heavy fermion systems.  These highly correlated systems are                     difficult to treat using conventional techniques.  The                          calculations proposed here are unique in coupling electronic                    structure calculations for these systems with many-body theory to               describe these highly correlated systems from a first-principles                approach.",
