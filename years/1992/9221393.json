 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposes connecting the computer network at the                University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC) to Internet, a                   worldwide computer network based on the TCP/IP communications                   protocol.  Included in Internet are the numerous NSF-assisted                   institutions that comprise NSFNET.  The connection will allow                   collaborations between faculty, researchers, librarians, staff,                 hospitals, and research centers.  This is of special importance to              UCHC's library because the National Library of Medicine has                     designated it the New England Regional Library in the National                  Network of Libraries of Medicine.                                                    The linkage will rely on a regional network, the New England               Academic and Research Network (NEARnet), that presently serves                  several nearby sites in Hartford.  A 56-kbit-per-second leased                  phone line will connect UCHC to NEARnet's present termination at                the University of Hartford.  NEARnet will operate Cisco IGS/R                   routers at each end of the line.  At UCHC, the router will connect              to our existing copper and fiber Ethernet system.  Simultaneously,              UCHC will fund major fiber-optic improvements to its local network.                  Apart from assisting clinical and research collaboration, the              connection will allow UCHC to develop servers for public domain                 software and to make its library catalog searchable from remote                 sites.",
