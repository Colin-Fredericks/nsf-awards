 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Dennis Powers is the Director of Stanford University's                 Hopkins Marine Station, located in Monterey, California.  The                   Station has a long and distinguished record of research support in              marine biology by Stanford faculty members and by visiting                      investigators.  Dr. Powers proposes construction of an addition                 onto the Station's current open-air tank seawater system.  The                  addition would be an enclosed environmentally buffered building                 dedicated to culturing and experimental studies of marine                       organisms.                                                                           The proposed facility would increase the quality and impact                of research projects currently underway at the Station, and would               attract new investigators and their students to the facility.                   Marine labs such as the Hopkins Marine Station will have increasing             impact on research in fields such as biomedical science, ecology,               evolutionary theory, oceanography, and global climate change.                   Providing these institutions with adequate facilities and                       instrumentation is essential for the U.S. research community.",
