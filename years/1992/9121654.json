 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at Cornell University                   supports interactive and interdisciplinary research in four major               thrust areas.  It provides a central focus for interdisciplinary                materials research at Cornell.                                                                                                                                  Researchers in the polymers and polymer composites thrust are                   studying polymer interfaces and thin films, nanoscale polymer                   composites, and the dynamics of liquid crystalline polymers.  The               quantum phenomena thrust addresses the influence of quantum effects             on electron transport in mesoscale systems, phase transitions, and              fundamental excitations in condensed matter; researchers in this                area also share expertise in low temperature experimental                       techniques.  The surface structure and dynamics of a variety of                 materials are studied in the surfaces and interfaces thrust.  A new             thrust on theory and modelling of materials represents a concerted              attempt to exploit major new computing resources to advance                     materials research in the MRL and beyond.                                                                                                                       The MRL also supports the development, operation and maintenance of             major central facilities for materials research.  It provides seed              funding for exploratory research, supports a program to enhance the             participation of minorities in materials research, fosters research             participation by undergraduates, and administers an active                      industrial outreach program.  The MRL currently supports the                    research activities of about 53 faculty members, 6 postdoctoral                 research associates, 39 graduate students, 17 undergraduates and 12             technical and scientific staff members: the MRL central facilities              also support a substantial amount of research that is funded                    directly from other sources.  The Cornell MRL is directed by                    Professor John Silcox.",
