 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of Groebner bases is the underlying theoretical                 base of the computational tools being developed in commutative                  and noncommutative ring theory.  Important results have been                    achieved in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, including               algorithms for polynomial factorization and computation of the                  greatest common divisor of polynomials.  There are algorithms for               the primary decomposition of an ideal, the construction of                      projective resolutions and syzygies, the codimension of an ideal,               the Poincare and Hilbert series, and the determination of ideal                 membership.  For noncommutative rings, Groebner bases are                       becoming increasingly relevant.  There are complications here                   since free algebras and path algebras are not Noetherian in                     general.  Recently, algorithms have been designed for finding                   syzygies, ideal membership, and computation of the Cartan                       determinant.  The theory itself has led to interesting questions                about algorithms and their implementations as programs.                         Theoretical questions on termination as well as effectiveness are               being studied.                                                                       This project will support a Conference on Computational                    Algebra to be held in May 1992 at George Mason University.  The                 conference will focus on some theoretical and practical                         applications of computational algebra, including topics in                      commutative and noncommutative ring theory which utilize Groebner               bases, as well as applications to other fields.",
