 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to conduct the first large-                      scale national study of the introduction and use of                             portfolio assessment in pre-college mathematics instruction.                    The goal is to identify principles that can inform continued                    policy and program development and that can stimulate new                       initiatives in assessment, curriculum, and instruction.                         Focusing on states, districts, schools, and teachers as they                    experiment with portfolio assessment to measure student                         learning, the proposed research will examine these efforts                      and the ways they affect curriculum and instruction in                          mathematics.  The workplan, which spans 35 months, includes                     a national survey of activities to introduce portfolio                          assessment at state and local levels, a comprehensive review                    of the research on alternative assessment practices and                         materials in mathematics, and related innovations in                            curriculum and instruction, intensive case studies of five                      promising local programs, and extensive product development                     and dissemination strategies, supported by a partnership                        between Policy Studies Associates and the Council of Chief                      State School Officers, will ensure high quality products and                    their immediate dissemination through a national network of                     state and local practitioners and policy makers.",
