 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of the heats of formation of a variety of                      biradicals will be conducted in the gas phase. The study will                   involve the use of laser photoionization mass spectroscopy and                  photoelectron spectroscopy to test the valence bond theory for                  biradical formation by making estimates of the singlet-triplet                  gap. The proposed investigation is based upon the assumption                    that the singlet-triplet energy gap can be obtained directly                    from the ionization potentials of the biradical and the parent                  radical intermediates. Species to be studied include benzynes,                  dehydrotoluenes, cycloalkynes, and a variety of other strained                  molecules. The reactive species will be generated in the gas                    phase by supersonic jet flash pyrolysis of appropriate                          precursors, and studied by vacuum-uv laser photoelectron and                    mass spectroscopy.                                                              %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                  of Professor Peter Chen at Harvard University. The                              investigation to be conducted will involve measurements of the                  chemical reactivity of molecules in the gas phase, and will                     provide information which will allow scientists to predict the                  direction of several important classes of chemical reactions.                   The chemical species to be investigated will be prepared by a                   technique called super-sonic jet flash pyrolysis, which results                 in the generation of reactive species by exposure of                            appropriate precursors to very high temperatures in a short                     time frame. The species produced are subsequently characterized                 by laser photoelectron spectroscopy and mass analysis. This                     work has profound implications for investigation of the                         reactivity of species which are produced in the atmosphere, and                 thus contributes to our understanding of processes which effect                 and alter the environment.",
