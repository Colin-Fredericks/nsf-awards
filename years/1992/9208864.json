 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic Meteorological Research Center (AMRC), one of                     three research centers in the Science and Engineering Technology                Center at McMurdo, is a resource for meteorological research and a              test bed for improving operational synoptic forecasting.  The Man-              Computer Interactive Data Access System (McIDAS), a versatile                   computer-based system for organizing, manipulating, and integrating             antarctic environmental data will form the basis of AMRC.  It will              capture the flow of meteorological information from polar orbiting              satellites, automatic weather stations, operational station                     synoptic observations, and research project data.  It will also                 receive environmental data products, such as weather forecasts,                 from outside Antarctica, and will act as a repository for existing              archived data bases.                                                                                                                                            Phase I, to begin in the 1992-93 summer season, consists of                     the installation and operation of work stations that can manipulate             and display AVHRR data based on the existing satellite imagery                  acquisition system.  Phase II will consist of the acquisition and               integration of a system that will provide data collection, data                 display and archiving, scientific applications, network communi-                cations, and remote user access.                                                                                                                                The McIDAS system, developed at the University of Wisconsin in                  the mid-1970's, ingests meteorological data from various sources:               standard synoptic observations, radiosonde profiles, satellite-                 based visible and infra-red imagery, atmospheric profiles inverted              from multi-spectral scanning sensors, and non-standard data such as             TOMS ozone data, SAR sea ice information, and the AWS network                   observations.  The system automatically registers, calibrates, and              locates (by geographical coordinates) the ingested information and              allows a user at a work station to manipulate the data base.  The               manipulations include sectorization, false color, enhancements,                 brightness stretching, overlays, looping, differencing, and are                 quite definitely keyed to synoptic meteorological research and                  weather forecasting.  The antarctic system is based primarily on                data streams provided by polar orbiters (AVHRR/HRPT and DMSP),                  since the look angles from geostationary satellites are so                      extremely low.  The full utilization of McIDAS capabilities in                  producing meteorological data products useful in both forecasting               and research will include a data transfer and communications                    capability to, for example, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology                (ABOM), the University of Wisconsin Space Science and Engineering               Center (SSEC), the Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center (FNOC),                  Monterey, and the European Center for Medium Range Weather                      Forecasts (ECMRWF), Reading, U.K.",
