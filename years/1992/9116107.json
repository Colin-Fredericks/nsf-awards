Bose of Stevens Institute of Technology, and                Dr. Marek Chmielewski of the Institute of Organic Chemistry,                    Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland, is to synthesize                    chiral B-lactams, an important group of heterocycles including                  antibiotics.  Work will emphasize variously substituted optically               active B-lactams and their stereoselective conversion to versatile              synthetic intermediates as well as to natural products such as                  sugars, amino acids, alkaloids, and antibiotics.  The researchers'              capabilities in X-ray diffraction and other instrumental methods for            structure determination are complimentary; both groups share a                  common interest in synthetic techniques involving novel forms of                energy input such as high pressure, ultrasonic, and microwave                   radiation.                                                                                                                                                      This project in synthetic organic chemistry fulfills the program                objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                 experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                      complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual              interest and competence.",
