 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research assesses the effect of learning resources (e.g.,                  presence of a local expert in a work group, information centers,                corporate-sponsored courses) on computer literacy.  The assessment              will be accomplished through a follow-up study of 30 of 89 work                 groups studied in three waves from 1987 to 1989.  Computer literacy             was first assessed in these groups in late fall 1989, with the                  development of an instrument for measuring computer literacy.  The              main question now to be addressed is:  in work groups in which                  computer use is already well-established, will computer literacy of             the work group show an increase, decrease, or no change from 1989               to 1992?  The researcher anticipates finding instances of all                   three, so generally will focus on the conditions which foster                   increased and decreased computer literacy over time.  The                       researcher will do this by collecting data from 30 work groups                  which vary in the mean computer literacy score of the group.  The               researcher will select 15 groups that perform primarily clerical                functions and 15 groups which perform professional functions, from              the large set of work groups which have previously been studied.                Everyone in each of the selected work groups will fill out a short              questionnaire and a two-week log of their interactions with others              in the work group.  In addition, the researcher already has                     substantial data about each work group from the following:  two                 interviews conducted with the head of each work group conducted                 about 10 months apart, two questionnaires filled out by each person             who was working in the work group in summer 1988 and fall 1989.                 Analyses will focus both on the individual and work group                       predictors of individual computer literacy and the predictors of                group computer literacy as well as factors which are associated                 with higher computer literacy scores in 1992 than 1989 and those                associated with lower computer literacy in 1992 than 1989.                                                                                                      This research focuses on the workplace as an environment for                    increasing the computer literacy of American society.  The proposed             research will explore the factors associated with computer literacy             and computer expertise in ongoing work groups.                                                                                                                  The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide                          opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigator's enhanced               visibility as a role model on the host campus.  The proposed                    activities which contribute to the second objective include:                    teaching a course, \"Women and Men at Work;\" giving lectures in                  other courses and/or public lectures; meeting with women's groups               (students, faculty, and staff); and mentoring students.",
