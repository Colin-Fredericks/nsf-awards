 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator is working on the derivation of a               macroscopic equation for the stochastic Ising model.  Studies of                the problem at low temperatures where different phases coexist                  indicate that the droplets of different phases evolve according                 to some type of \"motion by mean curvature\" PDE.  Related problems               can be proposed for either this model or its appropriate                        variations such as simple exclusions with speed change or the                   Ginzburg-Landau model.  Another problem of interest is the                      derivation of conservation laws for asymmetric simple exclusions                with speed changes.  Analyzing the asymptotic behavior of a                     tagged particle in this model is also of great interest.                             An important task in statistical mechanics is to derive the                evolution of a fluid from its molecular structure.  At the                      molecular level, a fluid consists of a large number of molecules                moving according to physical laws.  Microscopically, molecules                  collide incessantly and move somewhat erratically in a random                   like fashion.  Due to conservation laws of mass, momentum and                   entropy, molecules manage to organize themselves in such a way as               to form a flow pattern on a large scale.  Various Caricature                    models of a fluid will be studied to derive their macroscopic                   evolution from their microscopic structure in a mathematically                  rigorous fashion.",
