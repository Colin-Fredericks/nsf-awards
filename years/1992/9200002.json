 "awd_abstract_narration": "These mathematical investigations concern physical behavior                of materials and media which is caused by or related to a                       microscopic structure.  The questions to be considered include                  problems in which the physics is well described by averaging,                   such as estimating the overall elastic and electrical properties                of composite materials or describing the asymptotic behavior of                 aerosols; and problems in which averaging does not enter, such as               calculating the optical properties of diffraction gratings.                     Interestingly, these problems are not only related by their                     small-scale structure but also by the fact that similar methods                 and ideas can be applied to their study.                                             These questions are of theoretical importance in science,                  and vital in some engineering and industrial applications.  The                 Principal Investigator has recently introduced new methods based                on function theory to deal with high-contrast composites and                    diffraction gratings, and some mathematical constructions related               to a new kind of aerosol which arose recently in the photographic               industry.  Many improvements and further applications of these                  methods  suggest themselves.  The present goal is to extend and                 improve these methods so that they can be used in more                          complicated design and prediction applications than those                       permitted by the techniques currently available.",
