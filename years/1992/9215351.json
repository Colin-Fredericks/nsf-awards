 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to conduct an                          intercomparison on the measurement of sulfur gases in the air                   between various research groups who are measuring the gases.  These             gases are of major atmospheric importance, but at this time we do               not know if the different analytical instrumentation and methods                are equivalent in their measurement capability.  This is due to the             variety of preconcentration methods and equipment which are used to             measure the gases and to the high reactivity of these sulfur gases              with a variety of chemical species in the air, water, soils, etc.               This proposal is an omnibus proposal to provide for the logistical              support to perform the intercomparison and to analyze the data                  generated from the intercomparison.  The experimental design is                 such that both laboratory and field exercises will be performed and             that the range of concentration for intercalibration of each gas                will be from about five times the minimum detectable limit of each              gas to two orders of magnitude higher.  This range will cover the               range of natural measurements (part per trillion by volume to part              per billion by volume) and provide an experiment which can provide              for good statistical validity in the intercomparison.  A successful             intercomparison, with the validation of several research groups to              measure sulfur gases, will result in the ability to perform                     coordinated research projects to understand the vital role of                   sulfur in global climate change.//",
