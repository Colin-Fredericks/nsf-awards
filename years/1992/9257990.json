 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses problems in machine perception and                   robotics.  The work is focused in two areas:  recognizing curved                objects in images, and mobile robot navigation.  Recognizing                    complex curved 3D objects, whose image features depend strongly on              viewpoint, is one of the fundamental problems of computer vision.               Objects are modelled by collections of algebraic surfaces and their             intersection curves, and the geometric constraints involved in                  predicting and interpreting the images of these models are                      represented by sets of polynomial constraints.  Techniques from                 algebraic geometry and robust numerical methods can be used to                  solve these constraints.  Viewpoint dependent features are                      predicted from an object model and represented as an aspect graph               which enumerates all topologically distinct views.  Elimination                 theory is used to relate image measurements to objects, and                     optimization techniques can be applied to estimate an object's                  pose; objects are then recognized from a library of models.                     Problems to be addressed include automatic generation of object                 models, new object representations, prediction for sensors with                 limited resolution, computational efficiency, and indexing large                data bases.                                                                                                                                                     Mobile robots provide a dynamic test-bed for robust computer vision             algorithms in an unstructured world.  In addition to developing new             sensors, research focuses on obtaining the necessary information to             perform a task.  While some activities are readily achieved through             visual serving, others require developing a 3D representation of                the environment.  Stereo and structure-from-motion provide 3D                   information from image measurements which can be incorporated into              a relational map.  This map forms the basis for motion planning;                paths revisit previously seen places and strategies for exploring               new areas can be determined.  Additionally, robot tasks and                     cultural constraints are described more naturally when objects are              recognized within this map.                                                                                                                                     \f",
