 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research seeks to combine concepts in Kinematics and Computer               Aided Geometric Design (GAGD) to study motion interpolation and                 approximation problems from a computational geometric                           perspective. The goal is to develop computational geometric                     structure and algorithms that are suitable for computer aided                   geometric synthesis of rigid body motions both with and without                 kinematic constraints. The basic approach involves converting the               motion synthesis problem into a geometric problem of designing                  curves, surfaces, or solids. This is made possible using an                     orientable kinematic mapping which transforms motions (with one                 or more degrees of freedom) in the Euclidean space into curves,                 surfaces, or solids in a special projective space called the                    image space. The mapping facilitates integration of various                     methods in the fields of GAGD and computer algorithms to solve                  the motion synthesis problem. The research will develop image-                  space algorithms for designing a class of smooth piecewise                      parametric motions that interpolates through a sequence of                      displacements and develop geometric methods for approximating                   algebraic motions with the parametric motions. The results, in                  addition to their theoretical interest in computational                         geometry of motions, have applications in the design of spatial                 mechanisms and manipulators, computer animation of motions, and                 mechanical system simulation.*** //",
